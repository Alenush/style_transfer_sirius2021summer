PHOEBE: I'm done now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ssshh.
PHOEBE: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, Two of Them Kissed Last Night. There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!</s>

PHOEBE: If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure, now I’m scared.
PHOEBE: No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.</s>

PHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
PHOEBE: You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
PHOEBE: What stuff?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
PHOEBE: But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. So we're, we're good?
PHOEBE: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.

PHOEBE: Because it's in the past!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.
PHOEBE: I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
PHOEBE: Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So uh, how you doin’?
PHOEBE: Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Who’s this? Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? What kind of name is Brendy? Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahh that's the 2 points.
PHOEBE: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes!
PHOEBE: May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Spin the draddle, Rachel!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, your liver is right here.
PHOEBE: Okay, then I must be disoriented.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
PHOEBE: Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called leihalalokos.
PHOEBE: Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.
PHOEBE: It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
PHOEBE: And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yay!
PHOEBE: I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Great! Problem solved!
PHOEBE: But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
PHOEBE: Oh well y'know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow, that was kinda brutal.
PHOEBE: Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We know what we want.
PHOEBE: Oh, that's good.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, Look at me, I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
PHOEBE: No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. I’m Phoebe.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I put it on to scare Chandler!
PHOEBE: Monica's gonna totally freak out!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
PHOEBE: Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh come on!
PHOEBE: Damn you ref! You burn in hell!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! It's small.
PHOEBE: But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's terrible!
PHOEBE: Yeah, last Saturday. She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.</s>
