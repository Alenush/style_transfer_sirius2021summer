There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real.

ФИБИ: Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, my, god.
ФИБИ: You called Janice?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nice!
ФИБИ: Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
ФИБИ: Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, I am!
ФИБИ: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is insane!
ФИБИ: What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello! Hello!
ФИБИ: So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Oh, how did baby shopping go?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh well, where is he?!
ФИБИ: She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look! Isn't this what he would look like now?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!
ФИБИ: II wanna be with her, I like her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, we both can. And we both will.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ФИБИ: No-no! III found one.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
ФИБИ: He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
ФИБИ: You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
ФИБИ: What stuff?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
ФИБИ: But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to.
ФИБИ: No no no, I'll be nice, I swear! ' Could you just give me the.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know.
ФИБИ: Well, I can't help you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
ФИБИ: Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, plate?
ФИБИ: Plate! Yes, plate.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh!
ФИБИ: Well, just buy the damn boat!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We're with you. We got it.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
ФИБИ: Ohh, uh-huh so much!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
ФИБИ: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. So we're, we're good?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
ФИБИ: Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I've been better.
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And?

ФИБИ: Wait, do you know how youre going to stall her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
ФИБИ: So now why can't we tell Chandler?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! Rachel is meeting us here.
ФИБИ: Oh come on, they can be in the same room.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.
ФИБИ: Because it's in the past!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.
ФИБИ: I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Taxi.
ФИБИ: Bye you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, wh-why?
ФИБИ: It’s nice!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three.

ФИБИ: Doesnt Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its chicken.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I dont eat that either.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh, tramp!
ФИБИ: Does Joey have any idea?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: She said, He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Almost.
ФИБИ: How much was it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
ФИБИ: Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So uh, how you doin’?
ФИБИ: Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Who’s this? Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? What kind of name is Brendy? Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ahh that's the 2 points.
ФИБИ: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes!
ФИБИ: May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Spin the draddle, Rachel!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, your liver is right here.
ФИБИ: Okay, then I must be disoriented.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
ФИБИ: Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called leihalalokos.
ФИБИ: Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.
ФИБИ: It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
ФИБИ: And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yay!
ФИБИ: I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So we're doing it?
ФИБИ: Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
ФИБИ: I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
ФИБИ: Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah, I'mI'm walking down the aisle. Still walking. Mrs. Waltham.
ФИБИ: Oh please, hold it up so I can listen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
ФИБИ: Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey, ooh so, how was Vermont?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Great! Problem solved!
ФИБИ: But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
ФИБИ: Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
ФИБИ: Oh well y'know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, that was kinda brutal.
ФИБИ: Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We know what we want.
ФИБИ: Oh, that's good.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, Look at me, I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
ФИБИ: No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. I’m Phoebe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I put it on to scare Chandler!
ФИБИ: Monica's gonna totally freak out!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
ФИБИ: Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh come on!
ФИБИ: Damn you ref! You burn in hell!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow! It's small.
ФИБИ: But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's terrible!
ФИБИ: Yeah, last Saturday. She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.</s>
