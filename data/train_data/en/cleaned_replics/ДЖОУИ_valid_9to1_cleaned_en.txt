<s>NOTFRIEND: It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
JOEY: Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner. An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.</s>

But I wont have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne babyIm gonna want to meet her.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
JOEY: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
JOEY: I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too!
JOEY: Yeah, not it here it isn’t.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.

<s>NOTFRIEND: No I’m not! You are!
JOEY: Here comes the temper.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
JOEY: All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh Joey, Im so happy things worked out for us that were having this baby together. I love you so much.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
JOEY: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!</s>

JOEY: Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
JOEY: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oooh, I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you would be.
JOEY: How do you mean?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!

JOEY: Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, save us some pizza.
JOEY: Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.
JOEY: Well, have-have you told him how you feel?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
JOEY: You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.
JOEY: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah!
JOEY: So, was it amazing?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! It's. It's the foosball table.
JOEY: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life my time-machine.</s>

JOEY: Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace,</s>
