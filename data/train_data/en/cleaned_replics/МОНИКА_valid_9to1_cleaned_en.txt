<s>NOTFRIEND: Excuse me?
MONICA: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
MONICA: Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, God, your brother. Know what theyll say this year?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
MONICA: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?</s>

MONICA: Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Kids, new dream. I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli.
MONICA: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and.

<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every single second is like that with Aurora, and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh. Monica, can you help me with the door?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
MONICA: Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Actually, it's, it's quite, you know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of, co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house, with your stupid big cups, which I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're all, like, Oh, define me! Define me! Love me! I need love!

MONICA: So, what have you guys been doing?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?

<s>NOTFRIEND: You’re an actor!
MONICA: So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
MONICA: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know, finding gold.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I thought that movie was so incredibly, boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back'.

MONICA: So, what are you saying now?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!

<s>NOTFRIEND: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
MONICA: What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't have a fax machine.
MONICA: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
MONICA: I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
MONICA: He might still show up.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
MONICA: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What is wrong with Emma?
MONICA: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
MONICA: III think you look great.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
MONICA: That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
MONICA: That was a good day!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
MONICA: …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
MONICA: Wafer thin ice!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No-no, I got that.
MONICA: So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
MONICA: How's it going with her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So don't do it.
MONICA: How can I not do it? I have 127 in the bank.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
MONICA: But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Go.
MONICA: Alright, I ll go I ll go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
MONICA: Ross isn't here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
MONICA: Yeah, like I dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey! What's up?
MONICA: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
MONICA: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? Would we treat him any differently?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
MONICA: Betrothed.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
MONICA: Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn.
MONICA: No, not if their room has two beds!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Mon, how's it going?
MONICA: If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
MONICA: Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Kinda. They’re really big.
MONICA: Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I needed to buy a hammer the other night and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
MONICA: Ahh, hey honey, don't you have to be at your interview now?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
MONICA: No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C. H. E. E. S. E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
MONICA: Do you wanna do it with me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
MONICA: Well, I’d like to but, I’m not sure we have time to go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Pie eating contest?
MONICA: You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
MONICA: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thank you.
MONICA: Ok everybody, it's time for flan.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
MONICA: Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Aren't you going to swallow that?
MONICA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
MONICA: No, no, I don't.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? You think?
MONICA: Yes, you say to him I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
MONICA: Come on, we can't let them win!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.
MONICA: Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
MONICA: Fifteen minutes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!
MONICA: Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you doing?
MONICA: Alright, great. I'm going to tap class.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
MONICA: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law amp Order?
MONICA: Yeah, it's good.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Don't make me come up there!
MONICA: It's too late for apologies.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
MONICA: Only if you say his full name.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
MONICA: I dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God Monica!
MONICA: I wanna wear this everyday.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place wher crimes happen.
MONICA: How was that possible?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
MONICA: We’ll see.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
MONICA: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
MONICA: Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!</s>
