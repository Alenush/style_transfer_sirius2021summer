<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.
МОНИКА: An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: But I don't want you to.
МОНИКА: But I insist!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I mean I guess, I just have to, tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't. You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong.
МОНИКА: You have to tell David!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, well, this was very special.
МОНИКА: Rache, come see who's out here!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, this is a lot!
МОНИКА: Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Anything?
МОНИКА: I think I hear curtains closing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my god.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't have a fax machine.
МОНИКА: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
МОНИКА: He might still show up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
МОНИКА: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What is wrong with Emma?
МОНИКА: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
МОНИКА: III think you look great.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
МОНИКА: That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
МОНИКА: That was a good day!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?</s>

МОНИКА: Ross isn't here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
МОНИКА: Yeah, like I dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! What's up?
МОНИКА: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
МОНИКА: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? Would we treat him any differently?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
МОНИКА: Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?</s>

МОНИКА: No, not if their room has two beds!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Mon, how's it going?
МОНИКА: If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
МОНИКА: Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Kinda. They’re really big.
МОНИКА: Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I needed to buy a hammer the other night and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
МОНИКА: Ahh, hey honey, don't you have to be at your interview now?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
МОНИКА: No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C. H. E. E. S. E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
МОНИКА: Do you wanna do it with me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
МОНИКА: Well, I’d like to but, I’m not sure we have time to go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pie eating contest?
МОНИКА: You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
МОНИКА: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Aren't you going to swallow that?
МОНИКА: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
МОНИКА: No, no, I don't.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? You think?
МОНИКА: Yes, you say to him I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
МОНИКА: Come on, we can't let them win!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.
МОНИКА: Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
МОНИКА: Fifteen minutes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!

МОНИКА: Yeah, it's good.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't make me come up there!
МОНИКА: It's too late for apologies.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
МОНИКА: Only if you say his full name.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
МОНИКА: I dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God Monica!
МОНИКА: I wanna wear this everyday.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
