РОСС: YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
РОСС: Stop going through my stuff!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross. Ross!
РОСС: I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! Actually, thats one of the reasons why were not a couple.
РОСС: I chose those, Im a paleontologist.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, I can't tell it again.
РОСС: And I'm fine never having heard it. Rach, can I, can I see you for a sec?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No no no!
РОСС: I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Until then, General Grant, why dont you set up camp right there.
РОСС: We have a doctors appointment.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it.
РОСС: I forgot how hot she was!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I dont think you did a very thorough job!
РОСС: I dropped him off at Carols. Anyway, it turns out that Im not going to be able to get those tickets though.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
РОСС: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I try.
РОСС: You really want me to be the keynote speaker?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Right, well, we never actually got to that. Oh, it was.
РОСС: That's, that's nice twice!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
РОСС: Looking up?</s>

РОСС: Wha, what you really think we can do that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.
РОСС: Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
РОСС: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
РОСС: Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of this happened! Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
РОСС: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh?
РОСС: Hey Ross, it's you! Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, it didn't say This is a virus!
РОСС: What did it say?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.
РОСС: Oh right, right. So, are you, ah, you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.
РОСС: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
РОСС: I dont know. I mean II guess I could. Its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
РОСС: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
РОСС: Some would say she’s attractive, yes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know. Thanks.
РОСС: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I, had a uterus. I can’t believe this!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's uh, 12.50.
РОСС: Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Im buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
РОСС: No, itsIts not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you, Im not saying as your friend. ImIm saying as it as Monicas older brother.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
РОСС: I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m kidding!
РОСС: So-so seriously, what time?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are the odds? What are the odds?
РОСС: Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross!
РОСС: What's that supposed to mean?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!
РОСС: You really didn’t know?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Eleven minutes. And now twelve. So, do you like the beer?
РОСС: Although, it's actually a lager.</s>

РОСС: You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh wow! What now Ross youre not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean youd think the damn jalepeno wouldve cleared up your sinuses, but no! Thats not enough What are you doing?!
РОСС: Im getting that baby out of you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
РОСС: I made fun of his accent.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
РОСС: Be-caaauuuse.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh. Ross!
РОСС: Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
РОСС: So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I came with Paul!
РОСС: Yeah, I recognize the ankles!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
РОСС: So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
РОСС: I know, me too. You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No!
РОСС: Uh-oh, saved by the bell.</s>

РОСС: Okay, just breathe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
РОСС: Oh, you're the best.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
РОСС: Oh see, II needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?
РОСС: Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.</s>

РОСС: There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How are ya man?
РОСС: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
РОСС: Did you see the look that girl just gave me? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
РОСС: Now, I’m going to touch you. Ohh, that’s soft.</s>

РОСС: Oh, it was, nah, well.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait! But Ross if they dont get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
РОСС: Phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over her, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never been in love before so.
РОСС:! Youre in love with her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was.
РОСС: Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh, what'd you do to get her to laugh?</s>

РОСС: I don't know, but I. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!</s>

And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
РОСС: I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, Id really like to.
РОСС: Okay, hopefully this time mom wont boo you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
РОСС: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef-.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
РОСС: Fighting?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
РОСС: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.
РОСС: It took two people to break up this relationship!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
РОСС: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!
РОСС: Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: May I see it?
РОСС: Um, no.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
РОСС: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, answer his.
РОСС: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.</s>

РОСС: We totally forgot about lunch!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, we should. I think we should.
РОСС: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Fine, I will.
РОСС: Good, 'cause I love you.</s>

РОСС: Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
РОСС: We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, er, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The players.
РОСС: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Great. That would be fine.
РОСС: I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.</s>

РОСС: We’ve got presents!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey you!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
РОСС: Not that big a deal? Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
РОСС: It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
РОСС: Yeah thats what she said.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
РОСС: Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Eww!
РОСС: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my god.
РОСС: It's definitely getting worse.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РОСС: God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
РОСС: It-it’s great to meet you Paul.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
РОСС: My hands?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
РОСС: Gandolf the wizard. Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РОСС: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Weekend at Bernie's.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe you do that next time you get married!
РОСС: The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, yeah.
РОСС: I can't believe Chandler is missing this!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I studied for a year in Barcelona.
РОСС: Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
РОСС: Well, you need something to make this day special? You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.</s>

РОСС: Na-huh.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun. Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Thats-thats the real question. And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun. Now II know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.

РОСС: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman for her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Garfunkle.
РОСС: Why are you mad at me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
РОСС: I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I would love some, but you know what? You know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?

РОСС: Is this?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
РОСС: You take your time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're kiddin'.
РОСС: It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
РОСС: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
РОСС: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do.</s>

РОСС: It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the village. And now I have a broken foot!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
РОСС: But I'm not! You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Which do I like?
РОСС: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im going to need a bigger boat.
РОСС: I dont think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Um, so, I started to say you something earlier, um. There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I, was starting to have feelings, for someone else.
РОСС: Can I, can I ask who?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Just once!
РОСС: Stay away!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would have, happened already?
РОСС: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What was that?
РОСС: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a.</s>

РОСС: No, I dont want to hit you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
РОСС: That's too bad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
РОСС: What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?</s>

РОСС: Everybody!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, III am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
РОСС: Yeah, you’re right.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, put him on!
РОСС: Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
РОСС: Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen WillickBunch.

РОСС: That’s funny. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
РОСС: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
РОСС: Dude, we are sooo gonna party!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh come on Ross!
РОСС: No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!

РОСС: I could talk to her boss. I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.
РОСС: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!</s>

РОСС: Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.</s>

РОСС: Would it matter?</s>

РОСС: Why do you care so much?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.
РОСС: I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Would I do that if I loved her?</s>

РОСС: No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's ok that's how you feel.
РОСС: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You did!
РОСС: Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
РОСС: Guess what I got for your wedding!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
РОСС: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the brain transplant, you are going to be her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
РОСС: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it they’re like putty.
РОСС: Well then tell it to me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look I just thought that.
РОСС: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The sex of the baby, Ross.
РОСС: Oh, you know the sex of the baby?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, wait Phoebe.
РОСС: Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That’s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
РОСС: Oh, this will make a great memory.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
РОСС: Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen. Uh-oh! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel.
РОСС: Wh-why would he call you Muriel? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, that would be, Why are you being cute?
РОСС: Okay, I'm working on my flirting.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
РОСС: Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
РОСС: Well, the lighting was okay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
РОСС: It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
РОСС: Its sex.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How come you didn't come over earlier?
РОСС: 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? IllIll come back later.
РОСС: Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Ill guess justIll come back.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
РОСС: A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! What what what! Hi.
РОСС: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
РОСС: Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
РОСС: Phoebe, I told her you already knew.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I just can't stand you being here all the time.
РОСС: Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
РОСС: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes we are. So, coffee?
РОСС: Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
РОСС: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm, why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: II forgot my underwear.
РОСС: So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
РОСС: So let’s decide on the spending limit…</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pretty good! I told her.
РОСС: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? But, we don't have to go down that road.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're, and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
РОСС: Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?
РОСС: Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't see why not.
РОСС: Here's my retainer!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
РОСС: Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey uh, whats with the candy?
РОСС: Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Noo.
РОСС: What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh wow.
РОСС: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know, it's just, you know monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
РОСС: Too easy? Too. The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can't write! Y'know I mean III'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know. I can't do it.
РОСС: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my. How much do you weigh Ross?!
РОСС: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hit me!
РОСС: Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
РОСС: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? You can actually see it?
РОСС: In the U. S, China, Africa, all over.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
РОСС: Pants off Bing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh b-b-but it is!
РОСС: Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
РОСС: No, we can go to Williamsburg.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Good luck.
РОСС:: OK, I am calling your seventeen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, coffeehouse.
РОСС: Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can hop.
РОСС: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow! Look at this! I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt! Oh, this is yours.
РОСС: Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!
РОСС: Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She was nothing compared to you.
РОСС: She, she was different.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
РОСС: What trail?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
РОСС: You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, take your time.
РОСС: Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm not gonna gooo.
РОСС: You're not going to go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
РОСС: No, come on let her sleep! Shes so exhausted.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: How's my little boy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Why arent you with Rachel?
РОСС: Look, were not gonna be together just because were having a baby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She said, If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that.
РОСС: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah.
РОСС: Anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
РОСС: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A meatball Sub? Thanks!
РОСС: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
РОСС: You see Amanda and I have a very special.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
РОСС: It's starting to snow.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РОСС: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing. You know, like Ross's thing is.
РОСС: Science? Academia? Being a good father?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.
РОСС: Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
РОСС: That guy Lipson?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And say what? You owe me a goodbye, I mean, he's got more pride than that.
РОСС: THE HELL I DO!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, there was. It was there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read. Yes, there was.
РОСС: Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'd wait.
РОСС: You'd wait?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This almost never happens!
РОСС: Now she's passed.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Congratulations!
РОСС: What are the odds?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.
РОСС: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, Ross you have to be funny and sexy. Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are those your teeth?
РОСС: Ohh, you can see them, huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
РОСС: Oh, that's not what you want.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
РОСС: No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!

РОСС: Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
РОСС: Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!
РОСС: Monica and Chandler are living together!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
РОСС: It’s your joke.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
РОСС: No, no, I just have to talk to someone.</s>

РОСС: Well II havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow?</s>

РОСС: Did you stay here all night?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me.

РОСС: Not all bad.</s>

РОСС: You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother II have to tell you this.

РОСС: A dog? Rachel gets to choose.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, Ross!
РОСС: I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were different characters, plot lines, themes, a motif, at one point there were villagers.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
РОСС: It’s also a sign of friendship.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
РОСС: Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just head.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You too.

РОСС: It was a dry day.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Faster! You’re not going fast enough!
РОСС: Maybe I should stand on your feet!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
РОСС: Y’know what.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, its a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havent done the secret thing in a long time.
РОСС: Phoebe, there is no secret. I didnt propose.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?

РОСС: Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
РОСС: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.

РОСС: When Monica was a little girl, I remember that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
РОСС: Do them!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right!
РОСС: Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.

<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
РОСС: Well, what do you do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
РОСС: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey guys!
РОСС: No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
РОСС: What are you, a child?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! You’re going out with her again!
РОСС: Going out with who?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Co-founded!
РОСС: co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Of course there’s another guy! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
РОСС: I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!</s>

РОСС: Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Exactly.
РОСС: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What? You don't want me to get a job?
РОСС: Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
РОСС: Come on, seriously.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh?
РОСС: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
РОСС: All right, bye!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
РОСС: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
РОСС: He does not look happy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.</s>

РОСС: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Couldn’t I just say, This is Ross?
РОСС: Sure, do whatever you want.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, actually it.

РОСС: Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She laughed at you?
РОСС: I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and, why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
РОСС: Yeah, no problem.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok.
РОСС: Did the TV wake you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?
РОСС: Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
РОСС: Im just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. Uh yeah, actually Im free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!
РОСС: Look, forget it Phoebe. It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
РОСС: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel like less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
РОСС: That's, that's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I really don't.
РОСС: Can I talk to you for a minute?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I see where you’re goin’!
РОСС: What’s up with the greed Joe?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But I think we should tell her.
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
РОСС: Where’s 717? Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
РОСС: The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
РОСС: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Anything but stew.
РОСС: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It sounds interesting!
РОСС: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
РОСС: Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don’t you set us up?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
РОСС: Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.</s>

РОСС: Only way to fly.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
РОСС: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It won't come off!
РОСС: RachRach, are-are-are you sure?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who da wennyBenny boy? You the Wenny-wennyBennyBenny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
РОСС: Let me hold him for a sec. There we are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?

РОСС: Well, at least she's with PopPop and Aunt Phyllis now.</s>

РОСС: You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
РОСС: No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
РОСС: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. She plays for both teams!</s>

РОСС: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
РОСС: But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.</s>

РОСС: Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call unagi.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Um, there was a Geller Cup?
РОСС: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and, threw it in the lake.</s>

РОСС: Um is he a good guy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Dude, none of this is cool.
РОСС: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
РОСС: But you didn't! I'm still alive! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!</s>

РОСС: I want that place so much! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why don't you just get a roommate?

РОСС: Well, I’m not gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.</s>

РОСС: When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, so we weren’t prepared!
РОСС: I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I, look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well they were chair shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
РОСС: This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dike is practically life size.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no! Why not?
РОСС: Well it turns out that Ben and Stings son do not get along.</s>
