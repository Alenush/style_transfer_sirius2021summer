ROSS: It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.
ROSS: Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
ROSS: I'm gonna call after you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
ROSS: Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: So you're really okay with this?
ROSS: I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. II've been given the gift of time!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been dumped?
ROSS: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB GYN.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
ROSS: Except I don't wanna get over her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh God, absolutely.
ROSS: It's the museum again, can I, oh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! No, shesShe was nice. I mean, shes a little slutty, but who isnt?
ROSS: I liked her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
ROSS: So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The hot chicks?
ROSS: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanOr he does.
ROSS: No III would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok. Emma just said gleba!

ROSS: Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: My due date is in one week!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Dr. Geller?
ROSS: I wasn’t farting! Uh, a little game from our table.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.
ROSS: Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
ROSS: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
ROSS: Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of this happened! Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
ROSS: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh?

ROSS: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
ROSS: I dont know. I mean II guess I could. Its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?

ROSS: Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh, what'd you do to get her to laugh?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.

ROSS: Fighting?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
ROSS: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.
ROSS: It took two people to break up this relationship!</s>

ROSS: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!
ROSS: Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: May I see it?
ROSS: Um, no.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?

<s>NOTFRIEND: No, answer his.
ROSS: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.</s>

ROSS: Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
ROSS: We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, er, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The players.
ROSS: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.

ROSS: Yeah thats what she said.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun. Now II know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.

ROSS: Look, I took it too far!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oooh that may be a New World's record.

ROSS: Okay, Ill talk to him.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, come on.
ROSS: All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of ChiChi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. I think she was.</s>

ROSS: You're nose is bleeding!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi! Remember me?
ROSS: Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap.</s>

ROSS: Action.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
ROSS: Yeah, take your time.</s>

ROSS: I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut.
ROSS: If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it shouldnt stand in the way.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
ROSS:! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't. I don't really like to talk about it.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.
ROSS: I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty.! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh please.
ROSS: Oh, oh there go the clothes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You wear bi-focals?
ROSS: Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.</s>

ROSS: Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.</s>

ROSS: No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.</s>

ROSS: Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause II got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
ROSS: She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
ROSS: I could talk to her boss. I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.
ROSS: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He's perfect, he's never been better.
ROSS: What'd you do, take him whaling?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, I’m off to see your dad.
ROSS: Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
ROSS: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night. It was the first frost.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
ROSS: I want. OK, I want to, feel your, hot, soft skin with my lips.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s right.
ROSS: Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The diapers?
ROSS: In the hospital.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Dude, step up! I proposed.
ROSS: No, you didnt!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.
ROSS: I can’t believe no one believes me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Am I in it?
ROSS: Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’d be happy to. You are very sweet.
ROSS: Yes II am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
ROSS: Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I knew.
ROSS: I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I guess.
ROSS: Hey, save us some pizza.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, Santa!
ROSS: All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.</s>

ROSS: Oh my God, oh is today the twentieth, October twentieth?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Me too.
ROSS: I just heard.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: My God!
ROSS: What do you think you’re doing?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
ROSS: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl, is not a backhand.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
ROSS: You can have the last piece, if you want.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!

ROSS: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
ROSS: So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
ROSS: You may want to lose the foam finger!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Me too!
ROSS: Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Very bad!
ROSS: Very bad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
ROSS: Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Between you and…

ROSS: That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
ROSS: I do not always have to be-okay, okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
ROSS: I gotta get going.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its okay honey, youll find a name.
ROSS: Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.</s>

ROSS: Oh, you-you sure? So what’s uh, what’s your name.</s>

ROSS: Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is ridiculous.
ROSS: Oh, is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend. take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
ROSS: So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
ROSS: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you. God. Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.

ROSS: Yeah, all right, it’s a date.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
ROSS: That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
ROSS: Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh see, but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!
ROSS: Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to to ask a woman out,, who am I gonna ask?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
ROSS: Nono, he's, he's very docile.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and, it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
ROSS: Why do you care so much?</s>

All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to.
ROSS: Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?

<s>NOTFRIEND: No.
ROSS: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking Oh my god, I'm with Rachel. You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I havent discussed it with him yet, but I know hes gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.

ROSS: Alright, but you have to do one sometime.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: The sex of the baby, Ross.
ROSS: Oh, you know the sex of the baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, wait Phoebe.

ROSS: Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen. Uh-oh! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel.
ROSS: Wh-why would he call you Muriel? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, that would be, Why are you being cute?
ROSS: Okay, I'm working on my flirting.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
ROSS: Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
ROSS: Well, the lighting was okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
ROSS: It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
ROSS: Its sex.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How come you didn't come over earlier?
ROSS: 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? IllIll come back later.
ROSS: Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Ill guess justIll come back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
ROSS: A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! What what what! Hi.
ROSS: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.</s>

ROSS: Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?
ROSS: Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't see why not.
ROSS: Here's my retainer!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
ROSS: Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know, it's just, you know monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
ROSS: Too easy? Too. The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't write! Y'know I mean III'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know. I can't do it.
ROSS: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my. How much do you weigh Ross?!
ROSS: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hit me!
ROSS: Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!</s>

ROSS: Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?

ROSS: It's starting to snow.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi.
ROSS: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.</s>

ROSS: Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
ROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me.

ROSS: Not all bad.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
ROSS: It’s also a sign of friendship.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
ROSS: Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just head.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
ROSS: No, III’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
ROSS: Uh, Rachel is here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.
ROSS: Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I will.
ROSS: And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Im a commodities broker.
ROSS: Yeah that-that sounds interesting.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!
ROSS: Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, what was wrong with your old, human teeth.
ROSS: Ahh, II did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why not?
ROSS: The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
ROSS: Wha-? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative-there's gonna be a hoopla?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh, this poor little tuti is scared to death! We should find his owner.
ROSS: Why don t we just put the poor little TUTI out in the hall?</s>

ROSS: Well that depends, have you been a baaad gi, no I can't.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh. Thank you.
ROSS: That’s no problem.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
ROSS: I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How could it not matter?!
ROSS: How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.

ROSS: And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ciao, bela.
ROSS: Do they wait for me to do this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
ROSS: All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

ROSS: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ben, it's Rachel! But whatever.
ROSS: Everything okay in there?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I got nothing.
ROSS: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is goood.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ugh.
ROSS: Alright, ok, let's do it. Um, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating, um, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the, eh, there's the overview of the Triassic.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
ROSS: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. Well, you just must think I'm weird.</s>

ROSS: You should get some sleep.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What's wrong buddy?
ROSS: Someone at work ate my sandwich!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
ROSS: Your make-up!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, little Eric.
ROSS: That’s right! Wait no, Ben.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
ROSS: So uh, Emily called last night.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: EH, what do you know!
ROSS: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That was such a fun night!
ROSS: It wouldve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because we hate them.
ROSS: Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi! Bye!
ROSS: Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.

ROSS: My mommies love me. That's clever.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Faster! You’re not going fast enough!

ROSS: Y’know what.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, its a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havent done the secret thing in a long time.
ROSS: Phoebe, there is no secret. I didnt propose.</s>

ROSS: Yeah, what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before.
ROSS: I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know. What are you wearing?
ROSS: Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
ROSS: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
ROSS: Obviously not to Joey.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
ROSS: How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
ROSS: It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What am I gonna do?
ROSS: No, no, don't, don't, rub it! What gets out humus?! What gets out humus?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.

ROSS: Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so.
ROSS: So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, me neither. Yet…
ROSS: Uhhh…that-that may be weird.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.
ROSS: So all I need to do is get some new skin.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
ROSS: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you crazy?!
ROSS: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, I do when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
ROSS: When Monica was a little girl, I remember that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
ROSS: Do them!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right!
ROSS: Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
ROSS: You were at the coffeehouse!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
ROSS: Well, what do you do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
ROSS: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey guys!
ROSS: No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
ROSS: What are you, a child?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! You’re going out with her again!
ROSS: Going out with who?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Co-founded!
ROSS: co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Of course there’s another guy! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
ROSS: I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You got it.
ROSS: Okay, see ya later.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, you!
ROSS: Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Exactly.
ROSS: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
ROSS: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? You don't want me to get a job?
ROSS: Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?
ROSS: And so now you guys are gonna be married?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
ROSS: Nu-uh!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I mean, that's a typical guy response.
ROSS: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
ROSS: Come on, seriously.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh?
ROSS: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
ROSS: All right, bye!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
ROSS: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
ROSS: He does not look happy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No.
ROSS: Hey umm, was-was Monica here?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
ROSS: We are pretty good at this! We totally forgot about lunch!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Damn it! Rookie mistake!
ROSS: I have sex with dinosaurs?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
ROSS: I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
ROSS: Um, no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time-not any more. I just-I.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!
ROSS: I was just leaving.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Tails!
ROSS: It's heads. Gentlemen, pick your category.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
ROSS: The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That you’re a liar.
ROSS: No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What is that?
ROSS: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Couldn’t I just say, This is Ross?
ROSS: Sure, do whatever you want.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, actually it.
ROSS: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
ROSS: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
ROSS: Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She laughed at you?
ROSS: I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and, why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
ROSS: Yeah, no problem.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok.
ROSS: Did the TV wake you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?
ROSS: Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
ROSS: Im just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. Uh yeah, actually Im free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!
ROSS: Look, forget it Phoebe. It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
ROSS: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel like less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
ROSS: That's, that's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I really don't.
ROSS: Can I talk to you for a minute?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I see where you’re goin’!
ROSS: What’s up with the greed Joe?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But I think we should tell her.
ROSS: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
ROSS: Where’s 717? Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
ROSS: The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
ROSS: 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
ROSS: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Anything but stew.
ROSS: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It sounds interesting!
ROSS: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
ROSS: Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don’t you set us up?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
ROSS: Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!
ROSS: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not once.
ROSS: I thought so.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's not how you really feel is it?
ROSS: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
ROSS: Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi Ross!
ROSS: Hi roomie!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Take the top down did ya?
ROSS: Only way to fly.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
ROSS: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It won't come off!
ROSS: RachRach, are-are-are you sure?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Who da wennyBenny boy? You the Wenny-wennyBennyBenny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?
ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There we are.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
ROSS: Oh yeah, why not?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
ROSS: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
ROSS: A superhuman thirst for knowledge.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
ROSS: That's like insanely easy!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.

ROSS: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. She plays for both teams!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why can’t I find that?
ROSS: Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
ROSS: Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, ummthen maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Gimme your money, punk!
ROSS: Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No!
ROSS: Come on you guys, it's no big deal!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?
ROSS: I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay! I was thinking if its a girl, how about Sandrine? Its French.
ROSS: Thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure.
ROSS: I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.
ROSS: now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh crap!
ROSS: So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
ROSS: You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!</s>

ROSS: You know what I like most about him, though?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
ROSS: Turn! Turn!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. I'm really not.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What does that mean?
ROSS: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
ROSS: Ohh, this cake is really good!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Carol…Lesbian?

ROSS: Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
ROSS: May I come in?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
ROSS: Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
ROSS: It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.</s>

ROSS: C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.</s>

ROSS: Well it was the only thing to do there, that didn t have a line.</s>

ROSS: You - you're making money off my misery?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.

ROSS: Were so lucky.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
ROSS: Is that so?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
ROSS: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.</s>

ROSS: Come on, don't do this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
ROSS: I could, yeah, I can do that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You could say: Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?
ROSS: Ready to go?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can see the headline now: Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.
ROSS: Why would I eat my own arm?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
ROSS: Hey, where's Rach?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
ROSS: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Look, II wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.</s>

ROSS: Rach, I got a message from you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.

ROSS: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, its not. But Im rich and thin.
