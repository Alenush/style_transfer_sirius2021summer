<s>НЕДРУГ: It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
РОСС: That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
РОСС: Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Cassie needs to stay at your place.
РОСС: What—why?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and.

РОСС: Hey, do you have any gum?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wh-what's that?
РОСС: It's from Ross, it's a love bug.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don’t do this to me, again. You’d know I’d stay here in a minute, but I’d really miss so much work, they’ll fire me.

<s>НЕДРУГ: In bed?
РОСС: No, ha, no, not where I was going, er, if you get in the way, way of us becoming a thing, then er, I would be well very sad, um.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
РОСС: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.</s>

РОСС: You gotta help me figure out what to do.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
РОСС: You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.</s>

РОСС: What happened to the door?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hmm mmmhm.
РОСС: We are even, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face. And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.
РОСС: Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you love her?
РОСС: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?</s>
