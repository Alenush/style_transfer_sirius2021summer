<s>NOTFRIEND: In bed?
ROSS: No, ha, no, not where I was going, er, if you get in the way, way of us becoming a thing, then er, I would be well very sad, um.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
ROSS: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.
ROSS: Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
ROSS: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: See, now they're as different as night and, later that night.

ROSS: What happened to the door?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hmm mmmhm.
ROSS: We are even, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face. And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.
ROSS: Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Do you love her?
ROSS: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?</s>
