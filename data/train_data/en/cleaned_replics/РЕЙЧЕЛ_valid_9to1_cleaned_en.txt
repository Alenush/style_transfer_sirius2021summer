RACHEL: Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
RACHEL: Why, why not?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Um, cheers.
RACHEL: Oh, right, clink.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
RACHEL: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?
