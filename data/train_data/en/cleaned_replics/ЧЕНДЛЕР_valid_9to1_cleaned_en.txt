<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The meaning of the box is three fold. One, it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three, it hurts!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Totally!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don’t have to come up with this now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Could not be more terrified.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're welcome!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, you've been in there for a long time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: OK, so you wanna play it that way, do you?

<s>НЕДРУГ: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich'. Why don't you get a magician?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And that's how it's done!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: So are you gonna talk to her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Ya know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Ya know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You guys wanna eat here?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How did you?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Everybody down! Everybody down!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just meant hypothetically.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm just messing with you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well then maybe I will.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine with me.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, all right, I'll play.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When was the last time you saw her wear it?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Too dry.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Tulsa, Oklahoma!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The Sooner State, whatever that is.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y'miss it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you thing the good news is?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stick to your side!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every single second is like that with Aurora, and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh. Monica, can you help me with the door?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Some of them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Know when to stop.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a relatively open weave, and I can still see, your nippular areas.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Benefits lapsed.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's not that bad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, this is much better.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: God, I just, I hate her! I hate her! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think somebody has a crush on somebody.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't, don't!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Where there is no fear of commitment.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do we have any. Do we have any thoughts here?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well no, when I get to the point where, you know. I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike. I'm gonna come to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3. I've just thought of a fourth.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?TILLY: Thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, oh, c'mon in.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Awful! Horrible!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was not good. Not good.</s>
