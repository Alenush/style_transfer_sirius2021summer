<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler?
CHANDLER: The meaning of the box is three fold. One, it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three, it hurts!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Totally!
CHANDLER: We don’t have to come up with this now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Could not be more terrified.
CHANDLER: Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You're welcome!
CHANDLER: Honey, you've been in there for a long time.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: OK, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
CHANDLER: Actually I just got off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
CHANDLER: You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Ya know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Ya know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.

<s>NOTFRIEND: so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my, my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you doing here, Santa?
CHANDLER: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man?</s>

CHANDLER: Man, I am so beat.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?
CHANDLER: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
CHANDLER: Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I was dancing around, and singing No Woman, No Cry and I got stuck.

CHANDLER: What do we use to split it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
CHANDLER: Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!
CHANDLER: Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
CHANDLER: Hey, so can you make it on Friday?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Monica! Chandler!
CHANDLER: Hey-hey, hey! I don’t know why I did that!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
CHANDLER: It’s not a real game! I made it up!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?
CHANDLER: Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.</s>

CHANDLER: Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack.

CHANDLER: No, no, this is the first time.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Then be supportive like a guy.
CHANDLER: If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
CHANDLER: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
CHANDLER: Yeah, all right, I'll play.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
CHANDLER: Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
CHANDLER: When was the last time you saw her wear it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again! No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie.
CHANDLER: Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for Monica’s allergies. You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, you forgot?
CHANDLER: No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
CHANDLER: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I. I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
CHANDLER: Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
CHANDLER:! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Noo! But that would've been so cool!
CHANDLER: Her boyfriend Richard!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and, threw it in the lake.

CHANDLER: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
CHANDLER: No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just, let me know if she likes it, okay?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
CHANDLER: But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh?
CHANDLER: Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.</s>
