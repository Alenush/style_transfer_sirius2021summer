<s>НЕДРУГ: Nope.
ФИБИ: Broke them all, huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Oh, the Olympics.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebs, play with meeee.
ФИБИ: This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh hello, human-rights violation. CHANDLER: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women an everybody has a pretty good time. PHOEBE: Why don't you play with your roommate?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because it s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I m not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, he s lost it. He s totally lost it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh,then no thanks. What the hell was that, mental note if Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it, if she offers you mangled animal carcass you take it!
ФИБИ: New york city has no power and the milk is getting sour, but to me it is not scary, cause I stay away from dairy,, a la la.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, okay.
ФИБИ: Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, III made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooohhhh!
ФИБИ: And, and!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But the KitKats are all right?!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
ФИБИ: Look what you’re doing to Chandler! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t have any issues with my Father.
ФИБИ: Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, I actually havent even met him.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, yeah thats too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but its totally sold out. Why dont you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two Ill take you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.

ФИБИ: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Just so I know, if I had asked first.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe.
ФИБИ: We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Okay, listen Robert.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I think you're my favorite.
ФИБИ: Which one do you have?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
ФИБИ: You could do that?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh fresh air!
ФИБИ: Maybe, maybe youre overreacting! You do that yknow.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
ФИБИ: You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this BandAid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of…See?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
ФИБИ: What's block?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?

ФИБИ: Alrighty, here come the water works. Rachel starts crying.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh-uh.
ФИБИ: So what's going on?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
ФИБИ: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: I’m having another heart attack! Call 9-1-1!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow! What did he do?
ФИБИ: Im talking.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know what. I think this audition is over.
ФИБИ: Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You don't know military time?
ФИБИ: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, Phoebe, uh, you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
ФИБИ: Sure, ok, yeah.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes.
ФИБИ: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You do Pheebs?
ФИБИ: But I also believed her when she said I was next.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I didn't get it?
ФИБИ: They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
ФИБИ: Did everyone get out okay?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This place is amazing.
ФИБИ: God, that is the nicest kitchen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We were all pretty shaken up about it.
ФИБИ: Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im missin picture time?!
ФИБИ: Yknow she has a face Ross!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
ФИБИ: Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I know! Oh. I slept with Billy Joel. All right, who hasn't?
ФИБИ: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sorry!
ФИБИ: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
ФИБИ: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
ФИБИ: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
ФИБИ: That game should not be played without my supervision.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
ФИБИ: Shocking!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, you’re back!
ФИБИ: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What about my friend Victor?
ФИБИ: No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
ФИБИ: He was a lawyer!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, um. I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a, ah, little thing.
ФИБИ: I love things.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You just said it!
ФИБИ: Okay, well II was kinda hoping that I would just be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: If you want.
ФИБИ: What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm afraid I might just be.
ФИБИ: You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: Who the hell are all these people?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
ФИБИ: I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. Have you?
ФИБИ: Thousands of times! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, bigger than that.
ФИБИ: Give her a key to your apartment.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pants and a sweater, why Mom,, who am I going to meet in a blackout, power company guys, eligable looters,, can we talk about this later? Ok.
ФИБИ: Can I borrow the phone, I want to call my apartment and check on my Grandma. Wait what s my number? W well I never call me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?

ФИБИ: Oh you did? He did it! He did it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes! Yes, I did.
ФИБИ: Then do Iceberg!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
ФИБИ: Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is so unfair.
ФИБИ: Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
ФИБИ: Don't get me started on that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know.
ФИБИ: Alice would never go for it, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh great! Hello. He.
ФИБИ: Did you stop Rachel?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who is this?
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
ФИБИ: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: And a glass of tepid water.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
ФИБИ: Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?</s>

ФИБИ: I am one of Bens mothers. Im a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No!
ФИБИ: Okay, we’ll talk about something else then.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
ФИБИ: Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
ФИБИ: He broke that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
ФИБИ: I really hate to give her up. Oh, you should take her!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well then I guess then II would I would have to say C.
ФИБИ: Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
ФИБИ: Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes!
ФИБИ: Then yes that is what I’m having.</s>

ФИБИ: Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pheebs, I, there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
ФИБИ: I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm, raunchy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, whatever it is I'mI'm very, very sorry. Okay?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you here for tickets?
ФИБИ: Four would be great.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. We’ll be right back.
ФИБИ: So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?</s>

ФИБИ: Yeah, I can't say croissant.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, it was only okay.
ФИБИ: My mom was right. If I can't give him up, there's no way I can give up a little baby. Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed. What, what else can I give them? A kidney?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes.
ФИБИ: Is it a meatball sub?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
ФИБИ: Okay, there.</s>

ФИБИ: Y’know I’mI’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Son of a bitch!
ФИБИ: Okay, maybe ask this guy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm not Jewish, so.
ФИБИ: Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
ФИБИ: Well, you're just gonna have to try.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
ФИБИ: Ooh, I love that place! So, no.</s>

ФИБИ: Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
ФИБИ: Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying Terry's a jerk! That's where that came from.
ФИБИ: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
ФИБИ: Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: If you want I could loan you some money?
ФИБИ: I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
ФИБИ: No, I think you should tell them.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.

ФИБИ: Sure it does.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well Rachel’s not here!
ФИБИ: Why did you sign it, Son of a bitch?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
ФИБИ: You’re right! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm fine. Just-just, having my worst fear realised.
ФИБИ: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm huh.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
ФИБИ: Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like, sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
ФИБИ: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! trapped inside a physicist's body.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Why aren't you at home in bed?
ФИБИ: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
ФИБИ: That's him.</s>

ФИБИ: Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know, maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar.

ФИБИ: She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, who's this?</s>

ФИБИ: And also, my birthday.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I was just gonna ask!
ФИБИ: And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
ФИБИ: So you're gonna move?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
ФИБИ: Our first kiss.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married. I’m just going through a hard time.
ФИБИ: What did he say?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.

ФИБИ: Oh stop it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.</s>

ФИБИ: Oh no, how?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
ФИБИ: Oo! Is it for my birthday present?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Something to do with numbers?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ya know, the man's got a point.
ФИБИ: What is that sparkly thing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
ФИБИ: Sure, what, what was the work thing?</s>

ФИБИ: We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, honey, that's incredible!
ФИБИ: Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people… come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
ФИБИ: Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.

ФИБИ: So whose ring is it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And they knew about it?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes.
ФИБИ: Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What do ya say? What do ya say?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?
ФИБИ: Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
ФИБИ: Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.</s>

ФИБИ: Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I thought you only met him once?
ФИБИ: I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, the sex.
ФИБИ: What sex?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why don t you tell me something I don t know! He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey mouths Oops!
ФИБИ: Oh please, somebody tell me I don t have to go to work today!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ФИБИ: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these big massage places! They're putting people like me out of business!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
ФИБИ: Not if I get there first.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.
ФИБИ: The next next?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
ФИБИ: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Where did you get that?
ФИБИ: Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
ФИБИ: So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I don't know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
ФИБИ: I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah-yeah.
ФИБИ: But if no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
ФИБИ: I think on some levels she already knows.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
ФИБИ: So, what happens to the old guys?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
ФИБИ: Yeah, swing music is so out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
ФИБИ: Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Haaaa, ahhhh!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
ФИБИ: This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
ФИБИ: Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Tiny portions?
ФИБИ: Yeah well, excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
ФИБИ: That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh wow! Look at this place!
ФИБИ: Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore. New sconces!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!
ФИБИ: Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Oh, Marcel, come here. Oh come here Marcel.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You always said I'd make it.
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Fan out! Fan out!
ФИБИ: Ooh, y'know we could just do this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh really? Well, then you d better tell his other wife, cause she called three times asking where he is.
ФИБИ: Yes, I will tell her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah I can, it worked real well.
ФИБИ: No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No!
ФИБИ: Well, then tell him to stop staring!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
ФИБИ: And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
ФИБИ: I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah. Why?

<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Bye!
ФИБИ: I miss you already.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!

<s>НЕДРУГ: You look beautiful this evening.
ФИБИ: Show me the badge again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ФИБИ: Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, no. I just left.
ФИБИ: Well, you have to go back in.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
ФИБИ: Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved, basically it's entirely up to me.
ФИБИ: She is so great! I miss her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
ФИБИ: Oh, he-he can't talk right now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thats not your regular dry cleaners.

<s>НЕДРУГ: It’s cute, huh?
ФИБИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And he can dance!
ФИБИ: And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.
ФИБИ: Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay! Hey! What do I do?! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
ФИБИ: Did you find the dress?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Very good, so good.
ФИБИ: I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh?
ФИБИ: Okay, it’s okay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: After what I did? Can you blame her?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!
ФИБИ: So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do. Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!</s>

ФИБИ: Wow, it's like a time capsule!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.

<s>НЕДРУГ: OK!
ФИБИ: All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
ФИБИ: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh-huh, they already know it!
ФИБИ: You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'd do anything for you.

ФИБИ: What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and II can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
ФИБИ: If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
ФИБИ: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. Are you gonna kiss me?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Didn't I just throw you out of here?
ФИБИ: No, you threw out Phoebe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.

<s>НЕДРУГ: That's great! Hey! Excellent!
ФИБИ: Oh, God bless us, everyone.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a PlayDoo Fat Factory.

<s>НЕДРУГ: You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
ФИБИ: Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.</s>

ФИБИ: Is that him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
ФИБИ: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
ФИБИ: That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
ФИБИ: Coming through! Coming through! Coming through!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
ФИБИ: Knock, knock, knock.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?

ФИБИ: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
ФИБИ: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
ФИБИ: How can you not know which one?</s>

ФИБИ: Maybe it's too crazy about this. Alright so, you know, there is no future, but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. Forget what I said.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know.
ФИБИ: I owe Rachel 20 bucks!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, and you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
ФИБИ: And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. I see how you did that.</s>

ФИБИ: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not from where I was standin'.

ФИБИ: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, That's not how your dad used to do it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes!
ФИБИ: She's very excited about that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.
ФИБИ: Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
ФИБИ: Ooh, it's not a toy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.
ФИБИ: I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
ФИБИ: Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.
ФИБИ: Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ФИБИ: I see what you’re doing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b, baby and a Ross.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
ФИБИ: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. That works for me.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
ФИБИ: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't, not Monican. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello.
ФИБИ: Going to the hospital tonight?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is crazy.
ФИБИ: Robin is so gay!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! You're awake!
ФИБИ: How, how do you feel?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
ФИБИ: Yeah, but they didn't ask me! This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, I don't get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person.
ФИБИ: Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.</s>

ФИБИ: Is she in there?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

<s>НЕДРУГ: What did you just do?
ФИБИ: I licked my arm, what?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uhh, I wont take no for an answer.
ФИБИ: Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, your door isn’t sound proof.
ФИБИ: Nothing is good enough for her!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thomas, come back here!
ФИБИ: So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Can you just hold on for one minute?
ФИБИ: No, you have to let me in right now!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
ФИБИ: So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, but it's my job, sweetheart!
ФИБИ: Okay, then maybe I can come too!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
ФИБИ: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!
ФИБИ: We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ahhhhh!
ФИБИ: Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Must pee.
ФИБИ: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
ФИБИ: Hmm, bummer.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Jack? I hate him! Hes a jerk.
ФИБИ: Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You can’t marry him!
ФИБИ: Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ФИБИ: And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
ФИБИ: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about, it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us, the hollow shells.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. II just comforted her, as a friend.
ФИБИ: What do you mean, comforted her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
ФИБИ: Is Rachel having the baby?</s>

ФИБИ: You can go first.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
ФИБИ: Why are you dressed as a gladiator?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!
ФИБИ: Does that mean Carcass is available?</s>

ФИБИ: What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, shoot.
ФИБИ: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.</s>

ФИБИ: Have you seen your guy’s body?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What's 1922?
ФИБИ: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
ФИБИ: You mean like a doctor?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: I just lost a whole year of my life.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pheebs, what are you doing?
ФИБИ: Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What, what is it?
ФИБИ: You missed a belt loop.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And what are you going to do for him?

ФИБИ: Ooh, who's it for?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! Good luck!
ФИБИ: Yeah, bye.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
ФИБИ: Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.</s>

ФИБИ: You can actually see it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you like it?
ФИБИ: No, that would be, Why are you being cute?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
ФИБИ: Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you supporting?
ФИБИ: Duh!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
ФИБИ: It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, it costs 16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
ФИБИ: That s okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there, is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think hell have sex with you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
ФИБИ: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, its you. I see you everywhere. Im Jim, Jim Nelson.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well actually, Im picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe hell be there.
ФИБИ: Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! Thats why you have kids!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
ФИБИ: Okay, alright, I have a question, then.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
ФИБИ: You should've read it yourself!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
ФИБИ: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.
ФИБИ: My breasts are really strong.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So we do Supergirl.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
ФИБИ: Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
ФИБИ: Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
ФИБИ: Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: I don’t know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
ФИБИ: Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
ФИБИ: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
ФИБИ: Oh honey no, you ate it all.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hang on.
ФИБИ: I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
ФИБИ: I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.</s>

ФИБИ: Joey, you’re going to be great!</s>

ФИБИ: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
ФИБИ: Umm, no, not at first 'cause II don't want to freak him out.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing.
ФИБИ: Well, when can we have this shower?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.

ФИБИ: Um, do you wanna sit?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
ФИБИ: I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just. I want you to be happy.
ФИБИ: Living with you would make me happy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Seriously that's a lot of cups.

ФИБИ: You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.

I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.

ФИБИ: Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
ФИБИ: Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? I’m just said.
ФИБИ: No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Our sex.
ФИБИ: We didnt have sex.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
ФИБИ: She cant hear you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
ФИБИ: Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!

ФИБИ: Okay, well, guys?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: None.
ФИБИ: Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Be supportive.</s>

ФИБИ: Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
ФИБИ: It does, really?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.

<s>НЕДРУГ: How is she?
ФИБИ: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
ФИБИ: And um, and there's actually a, a woman?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This isn’t even my dress.

ФИБИ: Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Okay, wish me luck!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im sorry. I justwhen I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
ФИБИ: Maybe this is too weird.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: That is the rule, though.
ФИБИ: You're almost an uncle!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you smell beets?
ФИБИ: Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe! Fine, I won't use it!
ФИБИ: Promise?</s>

ФИБИ: So you're 5639?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
ФИБИ: Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
ФИБИ: Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know that. That's why I was getting married.
ФИБИ: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
ФИБИ: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We were having lunch. Yeah, and then, all of a sudden, we were like, We're here, we're having lunch, let's get married, right!
ФИБИ: Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too!</s>

ФИБИ: Almost never.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I’m gonna! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Did you find it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back, because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
ФИБИ: That's fantastic!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok. Why?
ФИБИ: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and. Paul probably.
ФИБИ: Chandler, I found the perfect ring.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
ФИБИ: We're just, we're trying to figure out an excuse. How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR, or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its just so glamorous.
ФИБИ: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Im sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? Yeah, like fifty bucks.</s>

ФИБИ: You know he's gay?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! Why?
ФИБИ: Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im not giving concert tickets to someone whod use their son like this!
ФИБИ: Then youre in luck! Bens not my son!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Tell her to wear her own earrings.
ФИБИ: These are her earrings.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
ФИБИ: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
ФИБИ: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can't find the remote. Thank you.
ФИБИ: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
ФИБИ: Maybe on some level.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: New wallet, huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.
ФИБИ: They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
ФИБИ: Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
ФИБИ: Oh, I have to get my number back. Dead on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is going in your book?

ФИБИ: Ohh, yes it would.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that’s me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
ФИБИ: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im told there are two sides to this story, but all Ive heard is that Bens a bit of a poo-poo head.
ФИБИ: Umm, Im sorry. Wont-wont Jacks father be joining us?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, how did you find out?
ФИБИ: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hhiii.
ФИБИ: Are, are you OK?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, but Pheebs.
ФИБИ: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
ФИБИ: Does he know?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.

ФИБИ: So what’s going on with you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.
ФИБИ: Not looking for dates.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How can you not believe in evolution?
ФИБИ: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
ФИБИ: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Shall we say, around seven?</s>

ФИБИ: No, that is the last thing you want to do!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
ФИБИ: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why, does she have a bad personality?
ФИБИ: Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!</s>

ФИБИ: Ill call Zurich and move some money around.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What about it?
ФИБИ: Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.</s>

ФИБИ: Where're you going?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: She sells drugs to kids.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
ФИБИ: You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
ФИБИ: Let's do that!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you-I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
ФИБИ: I found it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
ФИБИ: Not if nothing happens. Why can't, why can't we just hang out as friends?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
ФИБИ: You didn’t tell her did you?</s>

ФИБИ: Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
ФИБИ: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
ФИБИ: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What does she do?

ФИБИ: Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And your breasts! Hmm!
ФИБИ: Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why dont we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.</s>

ФИБИ: No, its New York magazine. Its an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
ФИБИ: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! I can't understand that!'.</s>

ФИБИ: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?

<s>НЕДРУГ: once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault.

ФИБИ: Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.

ФИБИ: Just get your nails done?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it s bad enough that I m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we re in the room together there s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she s smooth! Smooth!

ФИБИ: And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I wish we at least knew his name. Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.</s>

ФИБИ: One really does have a stick up one's ass, doesn't one.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
ФИБИ: You think he’s emotionally unavailable?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
ФИБИ: But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!</s>

ФИБИ: Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are these, stitches?
ФИБИ: Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something. Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll.
ФИБИ: Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know we’d be great together!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes?
ФИБИ: You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
ФИБИ: Oh, Chandler funny?</s>

ФИБИ: Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Yeah, no they don’t do that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
ФИБИ: Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: You wanna try it again?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, yknow. I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
ФИБИ: Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
ФИБИ: Rachel has a new doll.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
ФИБИ: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get-is that a hickey?</s>

ФИБИ: I think that's a little weird. You know, it's vinyl.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey! We should just switch.
ФИБИ: Yeah absolutely!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
ФИБИ: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!
ФИБИ: But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know.
ФИБИ: Oh, there you are Ben!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women. So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
ФИБИ: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact, yes, I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’mI’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Joey!
ФИБИ: I’ll marry you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
ФИБИ: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What, what’s it, what’s going on?
ФИБИ: Yeah, this has happened before.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Y'know Phoebe, I’m gonna make this real easy for you.
ФИБИ: Well, that could’ve been really awkward.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is so unfair!
ФИБИ: Not really, I got to drag him around too!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and.
ФИБИ: You wouldn’t let her have a grape?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: About an hour ago.
ФИБИ: Wanna go see a movie?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And Ive met me I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
ФИБИ: But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?

ФИБИ: Wh-why is that the best part?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well.
ФИБИ: See, he's her lobster.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you talking about?
ФИБИ: Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like Mr. Boss Man. Bing, Boss Man Bing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I, had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
ФИБИ: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
ФИБИ: Ok, duck down.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
ФИБИ: I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, y’know the license plate game?
ФИБИ: I love the license plate game!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
ФИБИ: Sure, yeah!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey. What was that all about?
ФИБИ: She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.</s>

ФИБИ: Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's a Speedo.
ФИБИ: Oh crap!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
ФИБИ: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Suddenly, I very aware that I m naked.
ФИБИ: Okay, quit down.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You guys don’t think I look 19?
ФИБИ: We thought you said 90!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why?!
ФИБИ: Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!
ФИБИ: Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I was not!
ФИБИ: Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
ФИБИ: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
ФИБИ: Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Okay, you can arrest me. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
ФИБИ: That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
ФИБИ: Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! Ow!
ФИБИ: Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
ФИБИ: I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A tiny salt shaker!
ФИБИ: For tiny salt!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
ФИБИ: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: All right, all right, well just do our best. So lets say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you serious?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I locked him years ago!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.

ФИБИ: One of the babies is kicking.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Exactly!
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah I got that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
ФИБИ: Okay, you wore me down.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies. And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
ФИБИ: Well, Ross does. You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Glass, sand, whatever.

ФИБИ: I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Or?
ФИБИ: Or or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah Ross, I mean, we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, island's stuff.
ФИБИ: I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. I am not putting on makeup.
ФИБИ: Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? Demon! Demon!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
ФИБИ: There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
ФИБИ: Susan, he looks just like you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before leaving a room or my family will die.
ФИБИ: My mom's going to be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, hey! How about right above the TV?. That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh, Bob Sagett?
ФИБИ: No, no, no, no, oh, oh.</s>

ФИБИ: Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
ФИБИ: Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We do?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Fine, let’s do it.
ФИБИ: Oh, I have cards!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you are not, we tell you stuff.
ФИБИ: Ya hur! I was the last one to know. When Chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo, I was the last to know, when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Or, or the rodeo!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, II failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
ФИБИ: Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Your last dance. Do it for us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it’s you!
ФИБИ: I hope it’s you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
ФИБИ: If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not one that can pee on the roof.
ФИБИ: Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
ФИБИ: Umm, I think you're really, really great.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
ФИБИ: So what were you thinking?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
ФИБИ: I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
ФИБИ: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!</s>

ФИБИ: Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? I don’t.
ФИБИ: Sing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
ФИБИ: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
ФИБИ: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.</s>

ФИБИ: The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.</s>

ФИБИ: Or you could end up with everything.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
ФИБИ: I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.</s>

ФИБИ: No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! Okay, that’s a lie.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nothing.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
ФИБИ: Au revoir.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.

ФИБИ: How old is your phonebook?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and they say, they say that our only chance to have a baby is if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish, and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.

<s>НЕДРУГ: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
ФИБИ: Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And you don't a little good about donating the money?
ФИБИ: No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
ФИБИ: Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you!</s>

ФИБИ: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know!
ФИБИ: It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
ФИБИ: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.</s>

ФИБИ: I’mI’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and, well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said Boy, I want that.
ФИБИ: Mike and I broke up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
ФИБИ: Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!</s>
