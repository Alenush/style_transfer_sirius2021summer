<s>NOTFRIEND: Just so I know, if I had asked first.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe.
PHOEBE: We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
PHOEBE: Okay, listen Robert.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh-uh.
PHOEBE: So what's going on?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
PHOEBE: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
PHOEBE: I’m having another heart attack! Call 9-1-1!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! What did he do?

<s>NOTFRIEND: You don't know military time?
PHOEBE: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, Phoebe, uh, you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
PHOEBE: Sure, ok, yeah.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes.
PHOEBE: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You do Pheebs?
PHOEBE: But I also believed her when she said I was next.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
PHOEBE: Did everyone get out okay?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This place is amazing.
PHOEBE: God, that is the nicest kitchen.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Im missin picture time?!
PHOEBE: Yknow she has a face Ross!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Sorry!
PHOEBE: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
PHOEBE: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
PHOEBE: That game should not be played without my supervision.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!

<s>NOTFRIEND: What about my friend Victor?
PHOEBE: No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
PHOEBE: He was a lawyer!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, um. I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a, ah, little thing.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm afraid I might just be.
PHOEBE: You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah?
PHOEBE: Who the hell are all these people?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
PHOEBE: I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. Have you?
PHOEBE: Thousands of times! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, bigger than that.
PHOEBE: Give her a key to your apartment.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
PHOEBE: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Pants and a sweater, why Mom,, who am I going to meet in a blackout, power company guys, eligable looters,, can we talk about this later? Ok.

PHOEBE: Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, ooh Pheebs, are they in there?
PHOEBE: Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That is so unfair.
PHOEBE: Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
PHOEBE: Don't get me started on that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know.
PHOEBE: Alice would never go for it, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh great! Hello. He.
PHOEBE: Did you stop Rachel?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Who is this?
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
PHOEBE: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
PHOEBE: And a glass of tepid water.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
PHOEBE: Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
PHOEBE: He broke that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
PHOEBE: I really hate to give her up. Oh, you should take her!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well then I guess then II would I would have to say C.
PHOEBE: Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
PHOEBE: Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes!
PHOEBE: Then yes that is what I’m having.</s>

PHOEBE: Yeah, I can't say croissant.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, it was only okay.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes.
PHOEBE: Is it a meatball sub?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.

PHOEBE: Ooh, I love that place! So, no.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying Terry's a jerk! That's where that came from.
PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
PHOEBE: Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If you want I could loan you some money?
PHOEBE: I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
PHOEBE: You’re right! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm fine. Just-just, having my worst fear realised.
PHOEBE: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm huh.</s>

PHOEBE: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! trapped inside a physicist's body.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: OK!
PHOEBE: All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh-huh, they already know it!
PHOEBE: You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'd do anything for you.

PHOEBE: What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and II can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.

<s>NOTFRIEND: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. Are you gonna kiss me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t know!
PHOEBE: We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
PHOEBE: Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ Well, if everybody’s going.
PHOEBE: No, y'know what don’t close it ‘cause the, keys, are in there.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: You a little sad about that sweetheart?
PHOEBE: I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
PHOEBE: So do you want to hang out or something?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Who’s David Lynn?
PHOEBE: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
PHOEBE: How can you not know which one?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, you got it!
PHOEBE: Maybe it's too crazy about this. Alright so, you know, there is no future, but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. Forget what I said.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know.
PHOEBE: I owe Rachel 20 bucks!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, and you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
PHOEBE: And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. I see how you did that.</s>

PHOEBE: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not from where I was standin'.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
PHOEBE: Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
PHOEBE: I see what you’re doing!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b, baby and a Ross.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
PHOEBE: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. That works for me.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
PHOEBE: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't, not Monican. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hello.
PHOEBE: Going to the hospital tonight?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is crazy.
PHOEBE: Robin is so gay!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! You're awake!
PHOEBE: How, how do you feel?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
PHOEBE: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
PHOEBE: Yeah, but they didn't ask me! This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, I don't get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What did you just do?
PHOEBE: I licked my arm, what?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uhh, I wont take no for an answer.
PHOEBE: Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, your door isn’t sound proof.
PHOEBE: Nothing is good enough for her!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thomas, come back here!
PHOEBE: So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
PHOEBE: Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Can you just hold on for one minute?
PHOEBE: No, you have to let me in right now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
PHOEBE: Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
PHOEBE: So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
PHOEBE: Yeah, okay, my bad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Cups.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah?
PHOEBE: Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
PHOEBE: That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, but it's my job, sweetheart!
PHOEBE: Okay, then maybe I can come too!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
PHOEBE: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!
PHOEBE: We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahhhhh!
PHOEBE: Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Must pee.
PHOEBE: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
PHOEBE: Hmm, bummer.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Jack? I hate him! Hes a jerk.
PHOEBE: Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You can’t marry him!
PHOEBE: Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
PHOEBE: All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey. Wh. What are you doing?
PHOEBE: I'm trying to get your parents to like me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi.
PHOEBE: Sorry I'm late.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
PHOEBE: And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
PHOEBE: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about, it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us, the hollow shells.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. II just comforted her, as a friend.
PHOEBE: What do you mean, comforted her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
PHOEBE: Is Rachel having the baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So Pheebs, what is the book about?

PHOEBE: You can go first.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
PHOEBE: Why are you dressed as a gladiator?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!
PHOEBE: Does that mean Carcass is available?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
PHOEBE: What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, shoot.
PHOEBE: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!
PHOEBE: Have you seen your guy’s body?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What's 1922?
PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
PHOEBE: You mean like a doctor?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
PHOEBE: I just lost a whole year of my life.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Pheebs, what are you doing?
PHOEBE: Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.

<s>NOTFRIEND: We do five because that gives you a 25 chance that at least one will attach.
PHOEBE: 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What, what is it?
PHOEBE: You missed a belt loop.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And what are you going to do for him?
PHOEBE: I'm going to let him.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
PHOEBE: Ooh, who's it for?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey! Good luck!
PHOEBE: Yeah, bye.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
PHOEBE: Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, thank God.
PHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so still hoping.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
PHOEBE: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, let’s keep talking.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
PHOEBE: Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him. Hello? Hello?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Did the girl ever let you ride it?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.

PHOEBE: Shouldn't we stop this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I think you're sweet.
PHOEBE: It's just so hard, it's hard for me to, let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from, when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God!
PHOEBE: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
PHOEBE: Do you need some floss?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
PHOEBE: God Joey, this is taking forever!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Im sorry thats who I am. Im a positive person.

PHOEBE: Oh-okay, I get the game now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know that. That's why I was getting married.
PHOEBE: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
PHOEBE: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We were having lunch. Yeah, and then, all of a sudden, we were like, We're here, we're having lunch, let's get married, right!
PHOEBE: Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye!
PHOEBE: I miss you already.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
PHOEBE: Almost never.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I’m gonna! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!
PHOEBE: It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
PHOEBE: Did you find it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back, because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
PHOEBE: That's fantastic!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok. Why?
PHOEBE: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and. Paul probably.
PHOEBE: Chandler, I found the perfect ring.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
PHOEBE: We're just, we're trying to figure out an excuse. How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR, or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its just so glamorous.
PHOEBE: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Im sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? Yeah, like fifty bucks.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You didn't!
PHOEBE: We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, Pheebs.
PHOEBE: Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
PHOEBE: You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
PHOEBE: You know he's gay?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
PHOEBE: So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! Why?
PHOEBE: Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Im not giving concert tickets to someone whod use their son like this!
PHOEBE: Then youre in luck! Bens not my son!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
PHOEBE: Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
PHOEBE: Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
PHOEBE: Um, that's ok! Now we need the semen of a righteous man.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Tell her to wear her own earrings.
PHOEBE: These are her earrings.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
PHOEBE: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
PHOEBE: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't find the remote. Thank you.
PHOEBE: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
PHOEBE: Maybe on some level.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
PHOEBE: New wallet, huh?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.
PHOEBE: They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
PHOEBE: Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
PHOEBE: Oh, I have to get my number back. Dead on.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is going in your book?
PHOEBE: Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He's got nothing!
PHOEBE: Okay, I'm ready.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is it true they have beer?
PHOEBE: Everything you've heard is true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That wouldn’t help me.
PHOEBE: Ohh, yes it would.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that’s me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
PHOEBE: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Im told there are two sides to this story, but all Ive heard is that Bens a bit of a poo-poo head.
PHOEBE: Umm, Im sorry. Wont-wont Jacks father be joining us?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, how did you find out?
PHOEBE: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hhiii.
PHOEBE: Are, are you OK?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, but Pheebs.
PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
PHOEBE: Does he know?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
PHOEBE: I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I…I have to fire him.
PHOEBE: But why?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
PHOEBE: Good plan.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again hed make me eat the entire pack.
PHOEBE: Oh well, I will be there!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Jack from downstairs?
PHOEBE: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah!
PHOEBE: Umm, thank you for meeting with me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey uh, I don’t mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I. Well y’know II mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Let’s take a walk. Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
PHOEBE: So what’s going on with you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.
PHOEBE: Not looking for dates.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How can you not believe in evolution?
PHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
PHOEBE: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
PHOEBE: Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really?
PHOEBE: Shall we say, around seven?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Good for you!
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe! Come on, I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
PHOEBE: No, that is the last thing you want to do!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
PHOEBE: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why, does she have a bad personality?
PHOEBE: Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No!
PHOEBE: But you were going to propose?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh well, I'm divorced.
PHOEBE: Ohhh, wow.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How about fifty bucks?
PHOEBE: Ill call Zurich and move some money around.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What about it?
PHOEBE: Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.
PHOEBE: What is your job?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it!
PHOEBE: You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
PHOEBE: Where're you going?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
PHOEBE: She sells drugs to kids.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
PHOEBE: You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
PHOEBE: Let's do that!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: WhWhat are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
PHOEBE: You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah!
PHOEBE: Pumpkin? But did he ever call you like, Budolph?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye-bye.
PHOEBE: Poor Monica!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well relax, he'll be here.
PHOEBE: No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you-I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
PHOEBE: I found it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
PHOEBE: Not if nothing happens. Why can't, why can't we just hang out as friends?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
PHOEBE: You didn’t tell her did you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa! Hey-hey! What’s going on here? Who is this guy?
PHOEBE: I don’t know, he just started kissing me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, uh, we just uh, happen to wear the same shade.
PHOEBE: David and I did use to go out, but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only, he's only in town for a couple of days.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
PHOEBE: We should help him!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye.
PHOEBE: So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Here you go.
PHOEBE: This is a six-hour pill! That’s it! I’m out of the woods! What a relief!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to.
PHOEBE: Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
PHOEBE: Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
PHOEBE: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
PHOEBE: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What does she do?
PHOEBE: She's a waitress.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
PHOEBE: Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really?! Well, when?
PHOEBE: Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. But it won’t work out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That means nothing to me. Come on!
PHOEBE: Hi liar!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.
PHOEBE: There should be Gold Man!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?
PHOEBE: Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And your breasts! Hmm!
PHOEBE: Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why dont we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure.
PHOEBE: So, here we are. Nervous?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.

PHOEBE: This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Good! Good! Five points!
PHOEBE: All right, Joey, same question.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me wa me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin. PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera. JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
PHOEBE: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say. MONICA: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. To me that's nice. CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
PHOEBE: Okay, but.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t need that anymore.
PHOEBE: You borrowed my cab you have to drive it back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no, no, Ill be there too.
PHOEBE: Okay so, well just come up with some kind of signal if its going well you can take off.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is huge, you can buy me beer.
PHOEBE: I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
PHOEBE: Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wouldn’t she?
PHOEBE: Would she?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
PHOEBE: I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!</s>

PHOEBE: I don't even have a 'pl'.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry.
PHOEBE: Were you guys making fun of Parker?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If you have to call me name, I prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian, and once afterward. I'm sorry.
PHOEBE: It's ok that's how you feel.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He's like a big disgusting.
PHOEBE: like a.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
PHOEBE: Why not her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?
PHOEBE: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The cold weather hurts my hip!
PHOEBE: I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
PHOEBE: Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
PHOEBE: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not that bad! Did you hear the hammer story?
PHOEBE: Ok, ok, don't get all squinky.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
PHOEBE: Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm, I'm still me.

PHOEBE: Hey Chandler, why so fancy?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure.
PHOEBE: Are you wearing waterproof mascara?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look at this! There we go!
PHOEBE: Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
PHOEBE: I guess it was kinda funny.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
PHOEBE: I was preparing you for my, didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
PHOEBE: All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Give me that!
PHOEBE: All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know. I know. Oh God. Theres no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
PHOEBE: Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicas bathroom right?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
PHOEBE: Oh, you just know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Its mine.
PHOEBE: Is it an engagement ring?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
PHOEBE: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting, but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? That was fun. So who's hungry?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, Mom never hit.
PHOEBE: Ok, all done.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, was that good for you?
PHOEBE: Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Arghh!
PHOEBE: There's Monica and Chandler! Ahh-ahhh!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, she’s dying. Of a cough apparently.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Absolutely! Now get out of here you! Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me?

PHOEBE: Those are my shoes.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it s bad enough that I m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we re in the room together there s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she s smooth! Smooth!

<s>NOTFRIEND: I know.
PHOEBE: Oh, there you are Ben!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women. So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
PHOEBE: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact, yes, I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’mI’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, that's okay. It gave me time to, uh, finish glazing my nipples.
PHOEBE: Wow, you really go all out for company.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one.
PHOEBE: What do you know?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
PHOEBE: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now, tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.</s>

PHOEBE: Wh-why is that the best part?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, well.
PHOEBE: See, he's her lobster.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you talking about?
PHOEBE: Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like Mr. Boss Man. Bing, Boss Man Bing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I, had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
PHOEBE: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
PHOEBE: Ok, duck down.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
PHOEBE: I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.</s>

PHOEBE: I love the license plate game!</s>

PHOEBE: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Suddenly, I very aware that I m naked.

<s>NOTFRIEND: You guys don’t think I look 19?
PHOEBE: We thought you said 90!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?!
PHOEBE: Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!
PHOEBE: Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.</s>

PHOEBE: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
PHOEBE: Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Okay, you can arrest me. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
PHOEBE: That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
PHOEBE: Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! Ow!

PHOEBE: I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: A tiny salt shaker!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
PHOEBE: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
PHOEBE: Okay, you wore me down.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies. And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?

<s>NOTFRIEND: No. I am not putting on makeup.
PHOEBE: Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? Demon! Demon!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
PHOEBE: There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
PHOEBE: Susan, he looks just like you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before leaving a room or my family will die.

PHOEBE: To see if know what these guys are talking about.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Fine, let’s do it.
PHOEBE: Oh, I have cards!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, you are not, we tell you stuff.
PHOEBE: Ya hur! I was the last one to know. When Chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo, I was the last to know, when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
PHOEBE: Or, or the rodeo!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, II failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
PHOEBE: Your last dance. Do it for us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it’s you!
PHOEBE: I hope it’s you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
PHOEBE: If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not one that can pee on the roof.
PHOEBE: Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
PHOEBE: Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
PHOEBE: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you doing?
PHOEBE: Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.</s>
