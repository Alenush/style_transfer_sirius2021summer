JOEY: Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
JOEY: And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
JOEY: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: An egg?
JOEY: Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey! Happy Birthday!
JOEY: Hey-hey-hey!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right then.
JOEY: Oh, not my parrot.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And we did.
JOEY: All right Phoebs, way to go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, come on now!
JOEY: All right, what are we havin’?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.
JOEY: Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
JOEY: Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, you did!
JOEY: No, I didnt!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
JOEY: And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah. That’s me.
JOEY: You’re gonna have a baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Who the hell is Carl?!
JOEY: Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, Joey, same question.
JOEY: Uhh, they’re tall.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, a professor, uh?
JOEY: She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious. That's not how she used it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
JOEY: If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Can you be my dancing partner?
JOEY: That s not, prison lingo, is it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
JOEY: And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I want you to say that you like her!
JOEY: It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really, is he a swimmer?
JOEY: He's got the body for it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Je m'appelle Claude.
JOEY: Je depli mblue.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
JOEY: You got porn!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And?
JOEY: I’m out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Your liking it, huh?
JOEY: Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
JOEY: No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We know you're out there.
JOEY: Who do you think its from?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
JOEY: Oh, you said it Mike. There's got to be a better way!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right.
JOEY: It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright, check.
JOEY: Check.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
JOEY: Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye Janine!
JOEY: Did she just ask me out on a date?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And thank you for your time.
JOEY: So the Porsche guy took his car back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
JOEY: Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Excuse me.
JOEY: Boob job.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why me?!
JOEY: Its your bachelor party.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
JOEY: Whoaa! You cuddled? How many times?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? Like you have a routine?
JOEY: Each woman is different. You have to appreciate their uniqueness.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What, now?
JOEY: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the antiPaolo!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
JOEY: Now, where’d we land on those pancakes?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, boy, do they suck.
JOEY: Hey, listen, lady.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
JOEY: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you re work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she s into some other guy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? That's great!
JOEY: It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, that seems about right.
JOEY: Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know the words! You are so into this!
JOEY: All right, well maybe I m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I m getting pretty good at it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: God, you're beautiful, why are we fighting this? You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
JOEY: I want you. Let me make love to you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Joe what’s up?
JOEY: I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, II don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
JOEY: But it's available now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
JOEY: Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You do?
JOEY: You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
JOEY: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
JOEY: Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
JOEY: That means a lot to me man.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
JOEY: This is where I keep the pizza. Where did the napkin go?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat.
JOEY: Guess what job I got?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
JOEY: Some girl ate Monica.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Go!
JOEY: All right, all right, all right. I mean I ll have to check with him first, but I ll think he ll be cool with it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah, so glad you decided to come.
JOEY: Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
JOEY: Look, we are not gonna.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
JOEY: Take it back?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
JOEY: I bet I stopped listening before you did.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, or, or, or, MississPete.
JOEY: Oh, oh, I got it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: God!
JOEY: So that's it! Everybody knows!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
JOEY: I play Al Pacino's butt. He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And this?
JOEY: Glow-pop giggly jammer.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We’re waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
JOEY: Yeah lady! Give us candy!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow Joey, this is, uhh.
JOEY: Art.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, can't help but.
JOEY: How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I will not!
JOEY: You don't have to be so mean about it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You had sex with her didn't you?
JOEY: Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
JOEY: But my French was good?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
JOEY: So, uh, what happened?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
JOEY: That’s great! What’s the story?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm you’re parents will be at home in Queens.
JOEY: What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You got a present for my parents. Thats so sweet.
JOEY: Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No-no.
JOEY: Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know!
JOEY: I need an answer now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: See, I told you they don’t swim.
JOEY: Give him a minute.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Much sense?!
JOEY: Look Chandler, it was instinct! I just went for it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. Chandler: Calm down, calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
JOEY: Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But what about how much taller he is than me?
JOEY: I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
JOEY: I don't need this! I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What, woah, woah, 3500 at porcelain safari?
JOEY: My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
JOEY: I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
JOEY: That’s an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t know. Me neither.
JOEY: You forget how many great songs Heart had.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
JOEY: How did your date go?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, I'm a little shy.
JOEY: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
JOEY: Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
JOEY: What do you like better action or comedy?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
JOEY:! I'm the lead in a movie!</s>

JOEY: Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: When did I try to give you money?
JOEY: Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said No, you dropped it. Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey.
JOEY: Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. I think Im gonna go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just.
JOEY: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
JOEY: Five years.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
JOEY: Can I change a hundred?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?
JOEY: Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is.
JOEY: Weekend at Bernie's.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, you didnt!
JOEY: Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
JOEY: Well, back to square one.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no, no. What was that?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, okay.
JOEY: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
JOEY: Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, Joey. What's going on?

JOEY: But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have.
JOEY: This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that’s where the napkin is.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
JOEY: But it is a big deal! I have to tell someone!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi!
JOEY: Who's your friend? He's hot!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some, monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
JOEY: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
JOEY: Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, you got a little thing on your.
JOEY: Did I get it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, well, y'know umm. No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
JOEY: Won't-won't that take longer?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Um-mm.
JOEY: All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
JOEY: Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
JOEY: Look, it's not about her. But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
JOEY: Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, wheres Chandler?
JOEY: Uh, I think hes in Rachels room.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
JOEY: Hey, ooh Pheebs, are they in there?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Do we have any. Do we have any thoughts here?
JOEY: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs, get a bug. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.</s>

JOEY: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
JOEY: I do, and I so happy for you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
JOEY: Today? Some, not a lot.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Where have you been?
JOEY: Oh, just had a baby.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
JOEY: Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s right! Wait no, Ben.
JOEY: So you’ve just married the one time then?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
JOEY: All right, II'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
JOEY: Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, it's. Y'know there's no you may not!
JOEY: That's because all people are selfish.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
JOEY: What did they do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! Let me see.
JOEY: Who's that dirty old lady?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Monica’s pregnant!
JOEY: Is that why you guys had to get married?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
JOEY: No one’s home?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You like Rachel?!
JOEY: Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi, Joe.
JOEY: Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Who? Who is it?
JOEY: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but…</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
JOEY: Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
JOEY: Three Blind Mice goes like this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wonderful weird.
JOEY: Yknow what you guys? Im uh, Im gonna go too. And uh, Im sorry about everything.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I sort've already asked Chandler.
JOEY:! He got to do it at your first wedding!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
JOEY: But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book.
JOEY: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What do I do now?
JOEY: You play hard to get.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know, umm.
JOEY: Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
JOEY: Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, my, god.
JOEY: Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.
JOEY: Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive.
JOEY: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
JOEY: I'm glad we had this little talk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And for the gentleman?
JOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes!
JOEY: Yeah, he likes porn.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well wewe still hang out.
JOEY: Not like we used to. You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its likethings are different.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bastard!
JOEY: I am what you made me. I could go right now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
JOEY: Hi, sorry I'm late.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
JOEY: I'm comin' in!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
JOEY: Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! Thats a picture of your daughter, isnt it, well shes lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. Ill call you from Tulsa.
JOEY: Hey, so how is it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
JOEY: Hes not really my type.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh. Does Monica know about this?
JOEY: I don’t think so.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you doing?
JOEY: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You waah!
JOEY:aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
JOEY: There are?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!
JOEY: ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You knew about this?
JOEY: Uh, y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!
JOEY: I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look like?!
JOEY: I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
JOEY: Are you really not going?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't believe he's that upset about this.
JOEY: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have to go to China.
JOEY: The country?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We didn't change.
JOEY: So that's it? Just like that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We didn’t give you any money!
JOEY: You don’t think I know that!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye you guys!
JOEY: Bye-bye!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
JOEY: Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?
JOEY: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah!
JOEY: Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
JOEY: How come you have two? Chandler: Well this one's for you. Joey: Chandler: No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Joey: Wow, is this friendship? Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Chandler: That's what they'll call us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Drums?
JOEY: Drums!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
JOEY:! It’s 6 o’clock!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
JOEY: You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You could do that?
JOEY: The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Man, that's some bad advice!
JOEY: Thank God you guys are here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
JOEY: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Willing to adopt triplets? No!
JOEY: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How, how?
JOEY: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
JOEY: My scones.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bring it.
JOEY: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
JOEY: Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
JOEY: I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! 500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!
JOEY: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She already lives in London.
JOEY: Then you go to Tokyo.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't believe they're brother and sister.
JOEY: They're brother and sister!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
JOEY: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.
JOEY: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You mean with Casey.
JOEY: No-no-no, I think I m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She s pretty cool.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
JOEY: This will just be my batch.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's Erica.
JOEY: Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: There’s our star!
JOEY: So, so, what’d ya think?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know!
JOEY: Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
JOEY:!!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
JOEY: And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I guess we don’t have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!
JOEY: I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah!
JOEY: Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
JOEY: Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
JOEY: It's not what you think, that was.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts.
JOEY: But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
JOEY: Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks.
JOEY: Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
JOEY: Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. It's not that I'm a bad actor.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
JOEY: Here hold this. This old stuff just comes right off.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know.
JOEY: All right, I'll take care of it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
JOEY: Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay? You ready?
JOEY: Yeah, I. I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And the moment of joy is upon us.
JOEY: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
JOEY: Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? He's not even here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Why am I looking?
JOEY: Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, that’s true.
JOEY: Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I like it in the stern. of the boat. Hello.
JOEY: Hey, it s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Im wearing two belts.
JOEY: Are you drunk?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, it says Best Supporting Actress!

JOEY: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well. It’s a date.
JOEY: A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over.
JOEY: Ohhh, yeah!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
JOEY: I’m up for a Soapie!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah thats Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
JOEY: You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, yknow? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I dont like about her. You want to hear it?</s>

JOEY: And of course, crotchless panties.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. Ooh, OOOH, yeah, ya know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soo bombed,' or, umm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah me too.
JOEY: Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So you guys want coffees?
JOEY: Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.</s>

JOEY: Forget about it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, nice toilet.
JOEY: No no no, behind it.</s>

JOEY: A sharing buffer! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss.
JOEY: Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
JOEY: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Lick away my man.
JOEY: These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me.
JOEY: You gotta tell Ross how you feel.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That would work.
JOEY: Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.</s>

JOEY: Good call. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
JOEY: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't ge this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it 'If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?JOEY: Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. This makes me loo good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writer look good so how could they be mad about that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Then I'm happy too.
JOEY: Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman....inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Sing!
JOEY: I wanna rock and roll all night!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
JOEY: Well, it was a fight, based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or, whatever.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: III’m leaving the show?
JOEY: I don’t know. Did you hear something?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
JOEY: She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.

JOEY: I said I didnt technically.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, Joey, you OK?
JOEY: Yeah, I guess, it's just, you know, they're parents, after a certain point you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes.</s>

JOEY: To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
JOEY: Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
JOEY: You can just, y’know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
JOEY: That's so nice!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, try it.

JOEY: So you think Ross too?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Man, this is.
JOEY: Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
JOEY: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no!

<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, the seven of us miss you.
JOEY: Who's seven?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
JOEY: Yeah, they’re not coming.</s>

JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
JOEY: No, the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.</s>

JOEY: If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So you took off my pants and shoes?
JOEY: You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: As crazy as soccer?
JOEY: The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who’d you talk to?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Now calm down Joey.
JOEY: Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
JOEY: Good enough to get fired.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! Cool!
JOEY: Was the chord at least right.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
JOEY: Rach, there is a decent place to.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.

JOEY: Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have 1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Can I check out what she did to my room?

<s>NOTFRIEND: The job is in Paris.
JOEY: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but, am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.

<s>NOTFRIEND: You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
JOEY: Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Then go, go!
JOEY: I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
JOEY: That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. No, I just think that maybe II'd heard it somewhere before.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, he broke those too.
JOEY: So he likes to break stuff.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?

JOEY: Way to go robot!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure.
JOEY: Uh, does it hurt?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: And dignity.
JOEY: Okay, if you say so. Set!</s>

JOEY: Uh, no, she’s at dance class.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi, Joey.
JOEY: My god, Angela.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If I havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? Whats the deal? Oh, its nice! May I try a pink one?
JOEY: So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You-you do?
JOEY: You don't like Kathy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
JOEY: Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him but uh, I could check with him. He says it’s okay. Bye-bye!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Step back!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
JOEY: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. And the answer would be: nothing. This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
JOEY: Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.</s>

JOEY: I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
JOEY: Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from square one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
JOEY: Yeah, where were you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.
JOEY: Let me get that. You got five bucks?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
JOEY: Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No problem.
JOEY: Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No that’s La Guardia. This is Mexico.
JOEY: Well how-how, how will you be gone?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. Rachel’s pregnant.
JOEY: I can’t believe that!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
JOEY: Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
JOEY: Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt MONAY. I just. I wrote that out phonetically for you.
JOEY: Phonetically?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
JOEY: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you, get a baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, II don't think we should be cranking anything up.

<s>NOTFRIEND: But youre not bald.
JOEY: Its not on my head.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
JOEY: Those are almost right on the floor!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
JOEY: What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
JOEY: Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I had to go with the odds Rach.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help. And they're very hot!
JOEY: We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out!</s>

I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
JOEY: Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!

<s>NOTFRIEND: So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
JOEY: I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler and Joey's, it's continued from earlier. Joey is now.
JOEY: The stripper stole the.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don’t, maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.

JOEY: I'll give you one hint.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I was always Joanne.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Shhh.
JOEY: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. No.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What, is everything ok?
JOEY: Charlie and I broke up.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross’s parents are my parents!

JOEY: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no!
JOEY: No-no.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Ya know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Ya know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
JOEY: I just, I just don't think that I want it that way though, ya know. I mean, let's say I do make it, alright, I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent of because of, ya know, the Little General.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.

JOEY: That's some gentle comedy, dude.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
JOEY: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What is that?
JOEY: For the ride.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What’s the matter with you? Get out of here!
JOEY: Yeah, take a hike wetpants!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I thought so too, but then she said shed marry you.
JOEY: Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
JOEY: Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.</s>

JOEY: It s not like we re exclusive.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?

JOEY: Chandler, will you just come in already?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
JOEY: Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
JOEY: Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
JOEY: This is a bad idea. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, hey, man!
JOEY: Hey, whats up?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ewwww!
JOEY: Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: There's nobody here Joe.
JOEY: I guess not.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nothing.
JOEY: I am, free!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
JOEY: Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
JOEY: Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face. By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What's up?
JOEY: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
JOEY: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thats what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
JOEY: Didnt know that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I've had it.
JOEY: Yeah, I've had it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, what is it?
JOEY: Oh, they cut me out of the show.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you're gonna!
JOEY: I've been thinking. You know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This place is really my Grandmother’s. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
JOEY: Oh, you bet I am!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
JOEY: Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?

JOEY: That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! That’s why they trashed me!
JOEY: Wait a minute, wait a minute.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her, you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she, is, beautiful, and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
JOEY: Thanks dude!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
JOEY: You call that delicious?</s>

JOEY: Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as, as.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
JOEY: Hey, you know about that?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I do not hate Ross!
JOEY: Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You can still sleep at night and stuff.
JOEY: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hm-mm, corn beef.
JOEY: Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah?
JOEY: When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sure you have better things to do.
JOEY: Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.</s>

JOEY: Ooh, names?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right-all right, fine! II'm gonna call.
JOEY: Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester? And she'll go, No-no-no, it's Chandler. And he'll go, Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
JOEY: That-that is a good trick.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Good for you, Joey.
JOEY: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
JOEY: Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I found the picture!
JOEY: What picture?!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah, finally an explanation.
JOEY: No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring?
JOEY: No, and I did not ask her to marry me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.

JOEY: But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
JOEY: And there it is.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What's Phase Two?
JOEY: Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Cupping.
JOEY: That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, where did you study acting?
JOEY: Molly, people don't study acting.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You're not good!
JOEY: Always nice to meet a fan!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yes.
JOEY: Is that your card?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
JOEY: I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s not a state Joe.

JOEY: Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
JOEY: Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh come here sit down.!</s>

And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.</s>

JOEY: It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna b as good as you thought it would be. But this so was.

JOEY: Like you wouldn’t believe. This is a great place.</s>

JOEY: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh er, well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
JOEY: Oh baby-proofing. Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like. Joey fell down the stairs! or er. Joey electrocuted himself again!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's a big company, I don't, if you, I.
JOEY: Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
JOEY: Of course it was a line!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.
JOEY: Maybe you changed?</s>

JOEY: Oh, thats, uh, thats Phoebes friends dog. I dont know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
JOEY: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: But we should probably keep it down she's still in the bedroom.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!

<s>NOTFRIEND: My God!
JOEY: Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.</s>

JOEY: Yknow, I dont really know her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
JOEY: It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
JOEY: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
JOEY: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
JOEY: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
JOEY: We’re both your backup?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no! Who did that?
JOEY: Rach, what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
JOEY: You want my advice?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
JOEY: Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Fine with me.
JOEY: Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You walked around all night in the city by yourself?

<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
JOEY: You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
JOEY: I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
JOEY: Please don t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn t their fault, it was mine.</s>

JOEY: That's a tough one. Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and, no wait a minute, it was me who fell asleep. Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?</s>

JOEY: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child.

<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
JOEY: And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?</s>

JOEY: Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s what Monica said.
JOEY: After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!</s>

JOEY: All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Now, off the record, youre not.

<s>NOTFRIEND: That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I am pretending.
JOEY: Well then, do it better!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God!
JOEY: We don’t make enough fun of you already?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This sounds like a hernia. You have to, you-you go to the doctor!
JOEY: ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh!
JOEY: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
JOEY: In the box.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
JOEY: I just want you to say it once in a while.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
JOEY: Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
JOEY: Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
JOEY: Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow!
JOEY: It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: When you’re marrying us that’s what you should say.

JOEY: Well, this is awkward. I told you so.</s>

JOEY: Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
JOEY: IIII did?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
JOEY: Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
JOEY: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
JOEY: And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
JOEY: Oh, me, right!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
JOEY: Just put it on a plate and leave.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! Pathetic!
JOEY: I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
JOEY: So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Or that.
JOEY: I can't write! Y'know I mean III'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And the cream?
JOEY: Cheese makes me thirsty.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bogota.
JOEY: Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.</s>

JOEY: We'll be there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
JOEY: I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God. And that works?!
JOEY: Well it does when you combine it with, This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hello to the rest.
JOEY: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
JOEY: Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
JOEY: But over the past few weeks.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well? Isn't that amazing?

<s>NOTFRIEND: That's a pig.
JOEY: I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
JOEY: No, the quiet down thing!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. And top shelf: expired products.
JOEY: Why are you doing this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
JOEY: Drawing on your own experience, I like that!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh-uh. Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
JOEY: That’s not what she said last night.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, you're so sweet.
JOEY: But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
JOEY: II wasn’t in that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
JOEY: It's creamier.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa what?
JOEY: Ross has a boyfriend.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on, let me see that smile.
JOEY: I don't wanna.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: About what?
JOEY: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s a line from the show too!
JOEY: Okay, you watch too much TV.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
JOEY: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, Ginger something.
JOEY: No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right! Let's do it!
JOEY: Woo-hoo!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: and he couldn't let it go, and. I don't really know what happened with that either.
JOEY: Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
JOEY: Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
JOEY: So why don’t you give me your number?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joe?
JOEY: Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thank you!
JOEY: You know, uh. Chandler got you a gift, too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
JOEY: So where's Mon?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Her dancer friends?
JOEY: Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
JOEY: Who knows?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God!
JOEY: Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah!
JOEY: Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share. It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving. We too can share and love and have and receive.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
JOEY: Oh, wish me luck!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
JOEY: You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. I want you to be happy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
JOEY: Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, Began their beautiful journey…</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
JOEY: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I bet it’s fast.
JOEY: And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill free phone sex.
JOEY: Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
JOEY: What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
JOEY: How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
JOEY: Growth!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey dont worry, it was my mistake.
JOEY: No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just thatMan! That kid is going to town!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, thank you.
JOEY: You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
JOEY: You got that from what I said?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Just, just say what you feel.
JOEY: Marcel, I'm hungry.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joseph.
JOEY: May I have a word with you, please?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
JOEY: I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah?
JOEY: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'll give you another minute.
JOEY: Why are you going? He said she wanted the shrew!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do. I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
JOEY: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
JOEY: Right this is staging.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Did you stop Rachel?
JOEY: No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
JOEY: Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
JOEY: Whoa, I'm not done.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta. Joey Looks down.
JOEY: That's not food. No, I don't, no. Taps.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She was not good. Not good.
JOEY: She was nothing compared to you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?

JOEY: Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you're not, You're not, you're not, again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
JOEY: Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
JOEY: I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m Joey! How are you doin’?!
JOEY: How you doin’?! How you doin’. Go wait in the hall!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.
JOEY: No, I’m gonna! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, right.
JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
JOEY: Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
JOEY: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings.
JOEY: I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Achhh. It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. Except with you.
JOEY: Open the door.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
JOEY: I don’t know! Charity?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ben Franklin.
JOEY: Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: But it’s my car!
JOEY: Yeah, but it’s my wax.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.

JOEY: Anybody gonna eat that?</s>

JOEY: You a little sad about that sweetheart?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
JOEY: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Die Hard's still great!
JOEY: Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
JOEY: Lets just say I took care of it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I'll stop.
JOEY: Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, Eight years. And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and ummnow here we are.
JOEY: Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in love with you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow. What does that mean?
JOEY: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means you're gonna get eaten by a bear.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
JOEY: Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
JOEY: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh that would be great!
JOEY: Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh thanks!
JOEY: What time are you meeting her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.

JOEY: There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.

JOEY: Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, you never, you never talked about that before.
JOEY: Well, hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her, you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she, is, beautiful, and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sir?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hold on.

JOEY: I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, III don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
JOEY: I’ll uh, save your parking spot.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
JOEY: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Let us begin. Dearly beloved.
JOEY: Thats my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as Ive left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi!
JOEY: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
JOEY: No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hurry!
JOEY: Good luck, good luck!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!
JOEY: Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That’s so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar. The vicar? wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: uh-huh.
JOEY: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender, and I thought, well, how important can that be, right? Turns out very!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey! It's 42-21!
JOEY: This sucks, I was just up by that much!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you doing?
JOEY: I think I left a donut up here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I thought your time ran out.
JOEY: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.
JOEY: It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And the Knicks rule all.
JOEY: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
JOEY: You're mean!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
JOEY: You guys kissed! Oh my this is huge!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
JOEY: Well, this is still ruined, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
JOEY: No, I, I couldn't do that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
JOEY: Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! She-she-she's hurting me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
JOEY: We should really learn how to play the real way.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So-You got in voluntarily?!
JOEY: I was tryin' to make a sale! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
JOEY: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, this could be a little awkward. I'm just going to blow past it, well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
JOEY: What the hell are you talking about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What’s up with the greed Joe?
JOEY: All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth. Why did I do that?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You!
JOEY: It's the chick! She's going through some changes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal.
JOEY: Something like that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I really have to pee.
JOEY: Can I see the comics?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Over a month.
JOEY: Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
JOEY: Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, I m sorry! But there s nothing I can do, I think I m in love with her!
JOEY:! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sorry.

<s>NOTFRIEND: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
JOEY: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh?
JOEY: Whered you grow up, its so simple!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
JOEY: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Monkey lover!
JOEY: When do you think we lost her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: WellI really have high hopes for my band.
JOEY: He is funny.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I think so.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals!
JOEY: No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: True story.
JOEY: They're here allready?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
JOEY: I won’t leave you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
JOEY: Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit.
JOEY: Please I have an extremely high threshold. Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face! I'm all right! I'm all right!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! Why?!
JOEY: Well because you didn't give me advice! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
JOEY: Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
JOEY: Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is that really necessary?
JOEY: You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
JOEY: Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Joey, we’re ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he’s going to be playing your son.
JOEY: And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was.
JOEY: Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: ell the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
JOEY: Hey, this is ridiculous. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We did?
JOEY: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
JOEY: Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
JOEY: Well, when it’s not right, you know it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
JOEY: You want me to lie to Chandler?</s>

JOEY: Thats what you told me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but you said, Will you marry me?
JOEY: No, I didnt!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
JOEY: Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I knew you were likely to take a wife!
JOEY: Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
JOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.
JOEY: I don’t know why you just don’t say left.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Easy. Step. How did it get on?
JOEY: I put it on to scare Chandler!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nice car!
JOEY: Yeah, it’s not mine.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
JOEY: I can’t! II don’t have any other clothes here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Please stop it!
JOEY: Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
JOEY: What did you say to him?</s>

JOEY: Here she is! Future fashion superstar!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
JOEY: Ten. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure. What?
JOEY: Well, first it's not a purse.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Isn’t that a line from the show?!
