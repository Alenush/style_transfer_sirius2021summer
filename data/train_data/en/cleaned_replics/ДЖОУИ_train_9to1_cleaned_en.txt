ДЖОУИ: Ursula's-hot!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh wait you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
ДЖОУИ: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
ДЖОУИ: Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
ДЖОУИ: But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.</s>

ДЖОУИ: No more jam?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Na-ah.
ДЖОУИ: Friends, family, dog. Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place, so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here, when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure! Where is it?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
ДЖОУИ: That's a huge thing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?
ДЖОУИ: I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it. Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, all the women.
ДЖОУИ: Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: They know you know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
ДЖОУИ: The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
ДЖОУИ: Now she sounded breezy.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! What?!
ДЖОУИ: All that stuff you just said? I want that!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
ДЖОУИ: You finish, go.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Well, uh, how come?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh sweet Lord.
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry! I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Good for you. That was really mature.
ДЖОУИ: No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
ДЖОУИ: You got porn!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And?
ДЖОУИ: I’m out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Your liking it, huh?

ДЖОУИ: Oh, you said it Mike. There's got to be a better way!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, check.
ДЖОУИ: Check.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
ДЖОУИ: Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.

ДЖОУИ: Hey, listen, lady.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
ДЖОУИ: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you re work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she s into some other guy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? That's great!
ДЖОУИ: It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, that seems about right.
ДЖОУИ: Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know the words! You are so into this!
ДЖОУИ: All right, well maybe I m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I m getting pretty good at it.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Take it back?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
ДЖОУИ: I bet I stopped listening before you did.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, or, or, or, MississPete.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh, I got it!</s>

ДЖОУИ: But my French was good?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
ДЖОУИ: So, uh, what happened?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
ДЖОУИ: That’s great! What’s the story?!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, you got a little thing on your.
ДЖОУИ: Did I get it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, y'know umm. No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
ДЖОУИ: Won't-won't that take longer?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Um-mm.
ДЖОУИ: All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
ДЖОУИ: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica’s pregnant!
ДЖОУИ: Is that why you guys had to get married?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
ДЖОУИ: No one’s home?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You like Rachel?!
ДЖОУИ: Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles!</s>

ДЖОУИ: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but…</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
ДЖОУИ: Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book.

<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look like?!
ДЖОУИ: I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you are so great! Thank you!
ДЖОУИ: Are you really not going?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can't believe he's that upset about this.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
ДЖОУИ: How come you have two? Chandler: Well this one's for you. Joey: Chandler: No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Joey: Wow, is this friendship? Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Chandler: That's what they'll call us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Drums?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.

<s>НЕДРУГ: You could do that?
ДЖОУИ: The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Man, that's some bad advice!
ДЖОУИ: Thank God you guys are here!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't believe they're brother and sister.
ДЖОУИ: They're brother and sister!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
ДЖОУИ: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You mean with Casey.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, I think I m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She s pretty cool.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.

ДЖОУИ: Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
ДЖОУИ: It's not what you think, that was.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?</s>

ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I. I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And the moment of joy is upon us.
ДЖОУИ: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
ДЖОУИ: Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? He's not even here!</s>

Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?JOEY: Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ha-ha-ha! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
ДЖОУИ: And you don't a little good about donating the money?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
ДЖОУИ: No, the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok?

ДЖОУИ: If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So you took off my pants and shoes?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Now calm down Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!</s>

ДЖОУИ: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but, am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
ДЖОУИ: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?

ДЖОУИ: All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name it’s barely even a word. It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!</s>

ДЖОУИ: Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
ДЖОУИ: What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, could you leave me one?

<s>НЕДРУГ: So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, hey, man!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, whats up?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ewwww!
ДЖОУИ: Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you!</s>

I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face. By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What's up?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Oh, they cut me out of the show.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you're gonna!
ДЖОУИ: I've been thinking. You know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This place is really my Grandmother’s. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you bet I am!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I know! That’s why they trashed me!
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute, wait a minute.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her, you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she, is, beautiful, and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks dude!</s>

Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done.

ДЖОУИ: Why are you doing this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
ДЖОУИ: Drawing on your own experience, I like that!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh-uh. Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong.

ДЖОУИ: What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.</s>

ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?

ДЖОУИ: Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.

ДЖОУИ: Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are: from Passions: Erin Goff. From One Life to Live: Mary Loren Bishop, from All My Children: Sarah McCann, and from Days of Our Lives: Jessica Ashley. And the winner is……Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight, so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel, who’s sittin’ right there!</s>

ДЖОУИ: Feel better now?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Weird world. Your kids?
ДЖОУИ: I figure my character has kids.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Y'know, that's pretty good.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.

ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho! I bet the British version is goood!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter? Are you upset?
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ДЖОУИ: Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!</s>

ДЖОУИ: I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that.</s>

ДЖОУИ: It’s the Knicks!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who are they killing off?
ДЖОУИ: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! That's not gonna make you any money!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I, ya know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, ya know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe he, uhh, drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do they wait for me to do this?
ДЖОУИ: So are you gonna tell him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
ДЖОУИ: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Can I get some ice here?!
ДЖОУИ: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
ДЖОУИ: Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I'm an actor.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Theres one lucky to-go cup of coffee.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no, II really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! Especially with you.
ДЖОУИ: Psss, that is whack!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
ДЖОУИ: Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Excellent!
ДЖОУИ: There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So shes a.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, thats one naked hooker!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You told me I was the only one.
ДЖОУИ: Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
ДЖОУИ: Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey, you never, you never talked about that before.
ДЖОУИ: Well, hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her, you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she, is, beautiful, and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sir?
ДЖОУИ: What's in it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hold on.
ДЖОУИ: So Pheebs what's this guy like?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What picture?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.
ДЖОУИ: I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Listen, III don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
ДЖОУИ: I’ll uh, save your parking spot.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Let us begin. Dearly beloved.
ДЖОУИ: Thats my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as Ive left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hurry!
ДЖОУИ: Good luck, good luck!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!
ДЖОУИ: Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That’s so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar. The vicar? wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his. Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: uh-huh.
ДЖОУИ: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender, and I thought, well, how important can that be, right? Turns out very!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! It's 42-21!
ДЖОУИ: This sucks, I was just up by that much!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: I think I left a donut up here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I thought your time ran out.
ДЖОУИ: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.
ДЖОУИ: It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And the Knicks rule all.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
ДЖОУИ: You're mean!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ДЖОУИ: You guys kissed! Oh my this is huge!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.

<s>НЕДРУГ: If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
ДЖОУИ: No, I, I couldn't do that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! She-she-she's hurting me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
ДЖОУИ: We should really learn how to play the real way.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So-You got in voluntarily?!
ДЖОУИ: I was tryin' to make a sale! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, this could be a little awkward. I'm just going to blow past it, well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
ДЖОУИ: What the hell are you talking about?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What’s up with the greed Joe?
ДЖОУИ: All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth. Why did I do that?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You!
ДЖОУИ: It's the chick! She's going through some changes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal.
ДЖОУИ: Something like that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I really have to pee.
ДЖОУИ: Can I see the comics?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Over a month.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh?
ДЖОУИ: Whered you grow up, its so simple!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monkey lover!
ДЖОУИ: When do you think we lost her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: WellI really have high hopes for my band.

<s>НЕДРУГ: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit.
ДЖОУИ: Please I have an extremely high threshold. Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face! I'm all right! I'm all right!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! Why?!
ДЖОУИ: Well because you didn't give me advice! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
ДЖОУИ: Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
ДЖОУИ: Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is that really necessary?
ДЖОУИ: You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
ДЖОУИ: Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: ell the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, this is ridiculous. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We did?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.</s>

ДЖОУИ: Thats what you told me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but you said, Will you marry me?
ДЖОУИ: No, I didnt!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.</s>
