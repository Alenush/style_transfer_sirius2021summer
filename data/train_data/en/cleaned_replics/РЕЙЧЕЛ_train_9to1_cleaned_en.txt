RACHEL: Thank God you’re pretty.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Don’t do that.
RACHEL: Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.</s>

RACHEL: Well, well I came up with it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahhh! I heard I do, were halfway there! Okay! You!

RACHEL: Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, it is, at Office Max.
RACHEL: What did you get her?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
RACHEL: Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
RACHEL: Your company has a fine foods division?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's Danny.

RACHEL: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Then, can I have your number?
RACHEL: I'm sorry, no.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh Ohh, looks like I was the second to last.
RACHEL: Erm, so nice.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no!

<s>NOTFRIEND: You keep this up honey, and I swear, you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week.
RACHEL: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis, now she used to be a man. Oh look see, now there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. An. M. Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to p. Did you poo in the shoe? Bad, bad. A little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you owe me one, big guy.
RACHEL: Here's your lemonade.</s>

RACHEL: Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I guess so.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Do-do you, do you have brothers?
RACHEL: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
RACHEL: But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.</s>

RACHEL: I feel.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How's my little boy?
RACHEL: He's perfect, he's never been better.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So.
RACHEL: I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
RACHEL: Well-well you can give them to me! I havent felt my feet in years!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
RACHEL: Then, you will definitely get him back!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
RACHEL:! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?

RACHEL: I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!</s>

RACHEL: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
RACHEL: I think it's sexy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is an hour-long special episode. Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616. Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.
RACHEL: Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
RACHEL: But your divorce isn't even final yet.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like forget about her but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, Oh my god. So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. UhOh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
RACHEL: Emergency!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.

<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
RACHEL: This guy is a nightmare!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
RACHEL: Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.</s>

RACHEL: Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatif youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
RACHEL: But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanOr he does.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But you haven't even heard the chorus!

<s>NOTFRIEND: It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
RACHEL: Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: That does not mean you know us better, II want a rematch.
RACHEL: Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
RACHEL: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Unless You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, Im not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
RACHEL: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.

RACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
RACHEL: Hey, how'd the interview go?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
RACHEL: I don’t know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
RACHEL: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
RACHEL: See you in the parking lot.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.

RACHEL: No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And thank you, for that.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, where is everybody?
RACHEL: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
RACHEL: Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
RACHEL: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!

RACHEL: What’s up?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, thanks.
RACHEL: And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So. I've never played that!
RACHEL: Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?</s>

RACHEL: Well, because of us! Because of our history.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment.
RACHEL: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?

RACHEL: Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, me too. It was. You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
RACHEL: Uh-huh. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
RACHEL: And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What the hell are you doin'?
RACHEL: I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know. I mean, aren't you just a, little curious, what that would be like?.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. Youllyoure gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. Do you remember?
RACHEL: I hope youre going somewhere with this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even.
RACHEL: Alright, alright. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
RACHEL: Will you stop calling it your apartment!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, this, this is classic Rachel.
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah right. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up, and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't. And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
RACHEL: Joey, you never, you never talked about that before.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
RACHEL:! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying? I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
RACHEL: I mean, what brought that on?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi Ross.
RACHEL: I was just getting him to like you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know. I can make my pecs dance. I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks. I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
RACHEL: So maybe something in an office.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Totally.
RACHEL: Ross, you don't seem okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! I found it on the street.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
RACHEL: Oh, ah with who?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
RACHEL: Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
RACHEL: Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, it's, fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a.
RACHEL: What's.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
RACHEL: I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things. And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. What am I doing? Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
RACHEL: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
RACHEL: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y-sure!
RACHEL: And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
RACHEL: Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon, or I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
RACHEL: Yeah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no, this, this can't happen!
RACHEL: But can it, just, happen a little bit?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: It really was.
RACHEL: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'll treat you real nice.
RACHEL: Yeah, well, y'know umm. No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You can put the aisle over here, and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
RACHEL: I didn’t know you could get married here.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi.
RACHEL: So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know what to say.
RACHEL: You could, say you're sorry to her mom.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?
RACHEL: Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
RACHEL: I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors. I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. That is a weird sentence!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Stick to your side!
RACHEL: Hey, come on now!</s>

You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Better!
RACHEL: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just, move on with my life.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
RACHEL: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.
RACHEL: Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
RACHEL: Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You're mean!

<s>NOTFRIEND: You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
RACHEL: Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
RACHEL: The fear?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ill tell you about it later. Be cool.
RACHEL: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
RACHEL: It's really not that big!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
RACHEL: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I was thinking.
RACHEL: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So? What-what-what happened?
RACHEL: Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You do attract some stinkers.

RACHEL: Guess who we ran into today?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What if you put them here.
RACHEL: Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home. Joey, don't touch it!
RACHEL: I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
RACHEL: Since when do you watch the news?</s>

RACHEL: UNI-sex.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!
RACHEL: Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it.

And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
RACHEL: Why did you invite him? I can't stand that guy!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Later.
RACHEL: No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.</s>

RACHEL: Are you ready? We're gonna be late!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
RACHEL: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go. Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean.
RACHEL: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’
RACHEL: Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh. Ouch.
RACHEL: He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, that is nice, lying! No way is that the reason.
RACHEL: Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
RACHEL: I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.</s>

RACHEL: I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.
RACHEL: Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I guess, it's just, you know, they're parents, after a certain point you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes.

RACHEL: Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!</s>

RACHEL: Yesterday!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooo Rachel!
RACHEL: Oh come on, I already went.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Why?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? Like how?
RACHEL: Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
RACHEL: So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
RACHEL: Ive come up with a bunch of ideas!</s>

RACHEL: Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
RACHEL: Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
RACHEL: Did you call your parents?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m right here!
RACHEL: All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just. And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him but it just bothers me, all right?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, we were just.
RACHEL: Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here?</s>

RACHEL: Well look, if you don’t like this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah!
RACHEL: And did you notice?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
RACHEL: You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
RACHEL: Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It’s not here.
RACHEL: A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl. Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.
RACHEL: Hi mum, put her back on!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut.
RACHEL: Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Here you go.
RACHEL: That almost hit me in the face.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh, God it looks bad.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want.
RACHEL: Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
RACHEL: Well, things change.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
RACHEL: We're not?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How desperate am I?
RACHEL: Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now.
RACHEL: You can’t leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute.
RACHEL: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Rach, why won't they take it back?
RACHEL: Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.
RACHEL: Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We should help him!
RACHEL: Well, I don’t think they need any help.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
RACHEL: You would think!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t think she’d like that.
RACHEL: Okay, uh-uh imagine this, The Mr. Bowmont.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
RACHEL: Phoebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: NO!
RACHEL: All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah?
RACHEL: This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
RACHEL: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You can have the last piece, if you want.
RACHEL: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
RACHEL: Well why shouldn’t I?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
RACHEL: Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess II just wasn’t thinking.
RACHEL: Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about!</s>

RACHEL: Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him. No, I really shouldn’t say anything. No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Always nice to meet a fan!

RACHEL: Oh God, well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden Sweet 'n' Lo? I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but. Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.</s>
