And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think it's sexy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is an hour-long special episode. Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616. Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like forget about her but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, Oh my god. So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. UhOh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Emergency!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatif youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanOr he does.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: If there was I wouldn't tell you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well relax, he'll be here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, maybe you're right.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Typical.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You are just like Jack.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jack from downstairs?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: No just, nobody press on my stomach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You can keep those pants by the way.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rachel. Wait, wait.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you wait. This is ridiculous.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Whatever.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What'cha gonna' do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, you know, I don't know why you are so embarrassed. They were very nice boobies.

See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

<s>НЕДРУГ: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, how'd the interview go?</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh sure, Ross will do it! It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We'll ask Phoebe.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, because of us! Because of our history.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment.

Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she’s not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: I hope youre going somewhere with this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, alright. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Will you stop calling it your apartment!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up, and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't. And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: You didnt propose to me.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Since when?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was just getting him to like you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know. I can make my pecs dance. I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks. I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ah with who?</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things. And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y-sure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon, or I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I'll treat you real nice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, y'know umm. No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You can put the aisle over here, and put the wedding ceremony right over here.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I. I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Better!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just, move on with my life.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! All rightLook, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But, itll also be reallyreally great. Please Rachel! III really want you to stay.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pat the dog.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I want Gladys!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're mean!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, don't be such a baby!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You still love me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Daddy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So was I.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You like that? Let's take this into high gear.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You say you love this man, yet you're about to ruin the happiest.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Only way to fly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. Well, you just must think I'm weird.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The fear?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ill tell you about it later. Be cool.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's really not that big!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I was thinking.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So? What-what-what happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You do attract some stinkers.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dr. Long, Ive been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rub it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I would love to!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! Ah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Guess who we ran into today?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What if you put them here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home. Joey, don't touch it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: IIII’m just…I’m just a good kisser!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Since when do you watch the news?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She was kinda stupid. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you get? Emily! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rach come on, what?

РЕЙЧЕЛ: through the glass doors.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, Im just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Yknow because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because ImIm into S amp M. Im notIm not into anything weird. Yknow? Just-just normal sex. So, Im gonna grab my coat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, you had a good day huh? Big commission picked up a daddy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All that stuff you just said? I want that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Joey you don’t have 20,000!</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what is the other reason?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, how did it go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married. I’m just going through a hard time.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well what am I supposed to do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Youre supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Men are such idiots.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What else do they add smell too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: You've been in my room before!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What is this? Fruit?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica's making jam.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. She’s heeled!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go. Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thats right. The student has become the master.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh. Ouch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?

РЕЙЧЕЛ: On Melanie Griffith in Working girl. I think what you want is over here.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I KNOW!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You practice losing the Grammies too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I guess, it's just, you know, they're parents, after a certain point you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Storming out!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Barry who you almost?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Barry who I almost.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, see, that, that is the problem. He is too sensitive.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Too sensitive to take care of our baby?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: If she said to you, Ross, I want you on this couch,</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, Im, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no, that' not Joshua.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.</s>

РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not mad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, that’s it? A great idea!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?

My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket.
