<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’
МОНИКА: Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!
МОНИКА: Joey we know you steal our food.</s>

МОНИКА: We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
МОНИКА: Ohh, wow! That’s great! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window.
МОНИКА: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey let me.
МОНИКА: Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uhh, well, she's really good in bed.
МОНИКА: Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I was afraid of that.

<s>НЕДРУГ: It went under the table.
МОНИКА: Nobody move! Okay, you look that way I'll look this way!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!
МОНИКА: I love that!</s>

МОНИКА: Here, take a couple of these.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Bye.
МОНИКА: They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
МОНИКА: I know, he's just so, so. Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
МОНИКА: They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!
МОНИКА: Okay, its just Phoebe. Wills still on a diet, Chandler doesnt eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachels having her aversion to poultry.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What is the point of having them if we never use them?
МОНИКА: Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
МОНИКА: But the minute we start to lie to each other. And by 'we' I mean society.</s>

МОНИКА: After the snap!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica?!
МОНИКА: I'm just trying to spice it up!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes!

<s>НЕДРУГ: David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
МОНИКА: See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
МОНИКА: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Every little bit of you!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, this does butch it up a bit.
МОНИКА: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
МОНИКА: You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Either eat it, or be in it.
МОНИКА: So, what do you think?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
МОНИКА: So, did you two have fun?</s>

МОНИКА: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!
МОНИКА: Who’s David Lynn?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress.
МОНИКА: I’ll pick it up for you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'd do anything for you, you know that.

<s>НЕДРУГ: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef, what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
МОНИКА: Ok worse case scenario is we borrow some money from my parents.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
МОНИКА: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.
МОНИКА: That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
МОНИКА: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.</s>

МОНИКА: So, wait, you really did like my cookies?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! You bet roomy!
МОНИКА: Don't you mean.groomy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
МОНИКА: Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first weighing stuff.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
МОНИКА: What did I tell you about the hall?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your special tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
МОНИКА: Please, if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You dont?
МОНИКА: I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.</s>

МОНИКА: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I made fun of his accent.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Mon. Okay. I've gotta, just say what it is I'm gonna say. None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me.
МОНИКА: I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.

МОНИКА: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Go on! Go on.
МОНИКА: Chandler, for so long II wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.

МОНИКА: And a baby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh dear God!
МОНИКА: My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!</s>

МОНИКА: Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my 127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?

МОНИКА: Is it the Italian guy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
МОНИКА: You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, you're back too!
МОНИКА: Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
МОНИКА: I can’t promise anything.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, fine! Take his side!
МОНИКА: I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
МОНИКА: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
МОНИКА: Well, I hope you're happy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Noo!
МОНИКА: Does it involve clogs?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yep!
МОНИКА: Do you wanna do it at the same time?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
МОНИКА: I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're doing it again.
МОНИКА: We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
МОНИКА: But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
МОНИКА: Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh II dont know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
МОНИКА: All right, lets be practical, if Ross isnt willing to do it, hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow ChandlerChandler is good!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I guess!
МОНИКА: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It is! It is!
МОНИКА: No it’s not! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
МОНИКА: That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I think that’s fair.
МОНИКА: Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
МОНИКА: Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: There’s no back to this couch!
МОНИКА: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
МОНИКА: Say you're sorry.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Please!
МОНИКА: No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
МОНИКА: That’s what you say about porn.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
МОНИКА: But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're an excellent patient!
МОНИКА: So how does it look?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: See, he's her lobster.

МОНИКА: Why would I have the keys?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.
МОНИКА: Is that all?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Like you wouldn’t believe. Wow! This is a great place.
МОНИКА: Just make yourself comfortable.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point.
МОНИКА: Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
МОНИКА: Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
МОНИКА: Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: WHAT?
МОНИКА: Be that as it may, you think you could help us out here on that monkey thing? You know, just for old time's sake? Go Bobcats!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The eyesdid still sparkle.
МОНИКА: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
МОНИКА: Relieved?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
МОНИКА: Still, I was quick as a cat.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I. I. I.
МОНИКА: That is so sweet.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! You?
МОНИКА: You do know that was me who just said that right? As long as we’re both up.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, fine.
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I think you know.
МОНИКА: I don't really feel like it.</s>

МОНИКА: Well, what about his family?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
МОНИКА: I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with JeanClaude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: We just got her to go to sleep.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.

МОНИКА: Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
МОНИКА: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
МОНИКА: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, Who's the best of that? They'd have to go to you.
МОНИКА: So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?</s>

МОНИКА: Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I love you!
МОНИКА: Bonjour, monsieur.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
МОНИКА: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know that.
МОНИКА: Look at it! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases, fourteen.
МОНИКА: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can’t! II don’t have any other clothes here.

<s>НЕДРУГ: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.

МОНИКА: Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I quit and you learn what I do?
МОНИКА: It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Happy Thanksgiving!
МОНИКА: God Will Im so glad that you came! You mustve lost like.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
МОНИКА: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I am proud of all my friends today.
МОНИКА: My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
МОНИКА: Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: AND ON MY TURF?
МОНИКА: Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!</s>

МОНИКА: So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for Valentines Day.
МОНИКА: Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?</s>

МОНИКА: Okay, if you really wanna have sex.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you get used to it.
МОНИКА: Y'know, III don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Freaky.
МОНИКА: Weird, weird.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'll make it a hundred!
МОНИКА: One thousand.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
МОНИКА: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
МОНИКА: Okay, you come up with an idea.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’ll help you dial.
МОНИКА: I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.</s>

МОНИКА: Im sorry butnothing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
МОНИКА: No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, how long is this going to go on.
МОНИКА: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you. Thank you so much!
МОНИКА: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.</s>

МОНИКА: And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F. D. A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
МОНИКА: Mmm-mmm.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I want the little round waffles.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream.
МОНИКА: Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.</s>

For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably dont say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, ImIm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog ChiChi. I mean look how cute she is. Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didnt see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad?

МОНИКА: He took off?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
МОНИКА: But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
МОНИКА: You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was, well to always knock before going into the pool house, but the other thing was never borrow money.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Mhum.
МОНИКА: So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
МОНИКА: Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, hello, it's third down.
МОНИКА: No it's not, it's second.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!
МОНИКА: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What is so funny about that?
МОНИКА: IIt's, just the way you say it. I mean, you're funny. You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!</s>

МОНИКА: Would you look at them?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
МОНИКА: That's my pie!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
МОНИКА: Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl oh!
МОНИКА: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Still?!
МОНИКА: It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
МОНИКА: Why would someone do that?! One might wonder.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A place to eat spaghetti.
МОНИКА: What do you need it for anyway?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
МОНИКА: Hey, Rache, did you make your money?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
МОНИКА: Did that!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I dont think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.

МОНИКА: I guess they're back from their date.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh, thank God! Finally!
МОНИКА: Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know. And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: I just wanted to see how it's going.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did it turn into sand?
МОНИКА: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine.</s>

МОНИКА: I thought you said you were going to do nothing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
МОНИКА: Other people call me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause II got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!

МОНИКА: Shut up, and put my table back.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, yeah.
МОНИКА: We have got to beat them!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I bet it was about her a little.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who’s your band?!
МОНИКА: Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
МОНИКА: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Noooo.
МОНИКА: All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.</s>

МОНИКА: Oh good youre all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four oclock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Two pounds of Moca Java please.
МОНИКА: Are you guys ever gonna go out again?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, that massage wasn't long enough, or, I don't recognize any of those songs, or, you know, these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!
МОНИКА: So what do you, you think she's faking?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whats wrong?

МОНИКА: and head to Canada!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.

МОНИКА: There you go, enjoy your coffee.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes!
МОНИКА: Okay, come on, do it one more time!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh God, well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden Sweet 'n' Lo? I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but. Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
МОНИКА: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.</s>

МОНИКА: That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is, don’t you think?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its yellingbleedingdilating. Oh, the dilating.
МОНИКА: Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
МОНИКА: I could do that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and. I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
МОНИКА: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!</s>

МОНИКА: What’s hard to believe?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.

МОНИКА: Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
МОНИКА: Not at these prices.</s>

МОНИКА: Why can't you use the phone in here?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?

МОНИКА: What’s the matter?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
МОНИКА: Is that your sister?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, whaddya think George is like?
МОНИКА: I think he's shy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’
МОНИКА: Ross, foot on the floor or come over no more!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
МОНИКА: Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Drink?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I’ll have a scotch.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because I’m dumping him today.
МОНИКА:! You said he was sweet!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here, browsing through the personals.
МОНИКА: Youve been acting weird all afternoon.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
МОНИКА: Not everybody's happy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well what happened at dinner?
МОНИКА: My parents spent the money for our wedding!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
МОНИКА: Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great!, I was thinking we would eat around four.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
МОНИКА: It's like Rachel in High School.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Not even close.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
МОНИКА: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Where do you want to start?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
МОНИКА: Then all your stuff would be here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth 100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get. No way!
МОНИКА: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, What were you thinking?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I can't watch this. It's like Sophie's Choice.
МОНИКА: You know, I never saw that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls, funny.
МОНИКА: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I had one.
МОНИКА: I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
МОНИКА: I'm not always that bad!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
МОНИКА: Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well I didn't tell them!
МОНИКА: Them?! Who's them?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: With the claw?!
МОНИКА: Fine, Ill do it. Ive just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
МОНИКА: Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And thats every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again.
МОНИКА: The days and nights are hard! Look umm, Rachel Im sorry! I have to start getting ready! Im getting married today!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?
МОНИКА: Well, what am I going to say?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oww! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I. Ooh, a quarter!
МОНИКА: That really was some of your best work.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I did not say fat! I said, Fa-aa-aw-ow.
МОНИКА: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
МОНИКА: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
МОНИКА: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
МОНИКА: Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
МОНИКА: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, may I see the comics?
МОНИКА: I thought you were taking Ross to the game?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration. Oh my god. Oh my god, it's Barry and Mindy!
МОНИКА: Barry who you almost?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
МОНИКА: Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
МОНИКА: What have I not told you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my god.
МОНИКА: You kissed him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
МОНИКА: Phoebe that’s crazy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
МОНИКА: Where were your parents?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did that guy really make that joke?
МОНИКА: Naaaa. He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear, a little pee came out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: Well, youre-youre sweating.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What-what is love really?
МОНИКА: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, I love you! And she’s gonna say, I love you, too! And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?
МОНИКА: You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
МОНИКА: No he's not!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, what do you want me to say?
МОНИКА: Maybe, um, 'That was nice'? It meant something to me? 'I'll call you'?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more.
МОНИКА: You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It is off.
МОНИКА: Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It is our first official date. Our first date.
МОНИКА: Uh, hello.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
МОНИКА: Rachel's not here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh uh-uh pal! Dont call me mommy! Its bad enough you call your own mother that.
МОНИКА: Im actually with her on this one.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
МОНИКА: We have a ladle.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
МОНИКА: Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
МОНИКА: Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
МОНИКА: I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello!
МОНИКА: Hey, what's that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
МОНИКА: Game?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No.
МОНИКА: I really need to talk to you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh thats great!
МОНИКА: You cant start today! Todays the rehearsal dinner!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place.
МОНИКА: All right, biggest suite in the place.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. Thank you.
МОНИКА: No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.
МОНИКА: This isn’t mine. Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. What are we getting?
МОНИКА: Anything but stew.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Can I get some of that action?
МОНИКА: Now Im betting against all three of you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I’m so sorry.
МОНИКА: What’s the big deal?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You get your messages!
МОНИКА: Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
МОНИКА: Is your team winning hon?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
МОНИКА: Is that some kind of boat talk?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no, I can’t do that.
МОНИКА: If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh. How-how big is that?
МОНИКА: About nineteen pounds.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
МОНИКА: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How ya doin'?
МОНИКА: I'm a twinkie.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, whadyou do with him?
МОНИКА: You're awake!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
МОНИКА: So you watched the movies huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You still want that baby?
МОНИКА: God bless you Chandler Bing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
МОНИКА: Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
МОНИКА: Mine too.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
МОНИКА: All right, be my guest.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi!
МОНИКА: We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no.
МОНИКА: That had been your window.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What do we do?
МОНИКА: What do you mean what do we do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, thank you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Of course I did.
МОНИКА: Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
МОНИКА: All right baby, come on! I am on fire!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
МОНИКА: Bean bag chairs.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not if nothing happens. Why can't, why can't we just hang out as friends?
МОНИКА: If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Goodbody!
МОНИКА: If-you-say-so.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The cranberries?
МОНИКА: A monkey could have made 'em!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I heard it.
МОНИКА: It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yknow, I stillI cant believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean its Its like you and me going out, only weirder!
МОНИКА: All right, I know youre hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but dont say that again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did somebody sign your bra?
МОНИКА: So I got it when I was 13.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
МОНИКА: Either of you girls got a quarter?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! I know who the father is…
МОНИКА: People have got to finish their stories!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
МОНИКА: Hey, why don't you ask Richard?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And I will cook anything you want in here, and do anything in there!
МОНИКА: Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin’ me?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
МОНИКА: Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Its a lot of work.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
МОНИКА: And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Um-hmm.
МОНИКА: You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?
МОНИКА: I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
МОНИКА: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
МОНИКА: Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.
МОНИКА: What happened to Janine?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What's going on?
МОНИКА: Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How do you know? You don't have a watch.
МОНИКА: Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
МОНИКА: Joey, put that down! Okay, get out! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're right, I'm sorry. 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy.'
МОНИКА: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
МОНИКА: Let’s do it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why not?! I’m hungry.
МОНИКА: Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Candys the mother, Cookies the daughter. The fathers also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
МОНИКА: Phoebe, cmere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is not fun!
МОНИКА: Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
МОНИКА: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
МОНИКА: Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? How good?
МОНИКА: It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, it wasnt you.
МОНИКА: Well then who?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
МОНИКА: Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
МОНИКА: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Definitely.
МОНИКА: See there you go. We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
МОНИКА:! 007 has all those gadgets!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
МОНИКА: Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Y'know those are a delicacy in India.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler! Is he?
МОНИКА: Well, y'know III think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: How did it go with Frank and Alice?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ahh, you know what? That is. Who wouldn't want you?
МОНИКА: Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Youre not?
МОНИКА: Its the salts.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
МОНИКА: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica. Whaddya think?
МОНИКА: Mm-hmm.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
МОНИКА: Oh no-no-no, it's still me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I think you should give him your star.
МОНИКА: He doesnt even know what hes doing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but, yeah we do.
МОНИКА: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
МОНИКА: Why, exactly?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
МОНИКА: Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t think you can do that!
МОНИКА: This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
МОНИКА: What do you think brought than on?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You wish.
МОНИКА: Hey, I couldve had you if I wanted you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
МОНИКА: This is not the bed I ordered!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
МОНИКА: Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
МОНИКА: You don't know that.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I think. I think I can see your scalp.
МОНИКА: Don't you just love it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You?! And-and you?!
МОНИКА: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The head, the head. You gotta.
МОНИКА: I'm your Aunt Monica. I'm your Aunt Monica. I will always have gum.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?!
МОНИКА: I bet I can do it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
МОНИКА: No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can an A? In-in school? Hey, Im a dork.
МОНИКА: Im so proud of you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
МОНИКА: That’s true! I knew I married you for a reason!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will.
МОНИКА: So have you called her yet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
МОНИКА: Has somebody been drinking my fat?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Fine!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, what's the matter?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
МОНИКА: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We won. We won!
МОНИКА: Heckles.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…
МОНИКА: Phoebe, that is awful!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How how did you know I was here?
МОНИКА: It was my credit card you were using.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp to be a counselor!
МОНИКА: Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes. Did you settle the bill?
МОНИКА: I hate this part.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you?
МОНИКА: Ah, yeah!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
МОНИКА: I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
МОНИКА: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? IIII can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
МОНИКА: Aww, not right now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
МОНИКА: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
МОНИКА: You're not gonna be phased out!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
МОНИКА: Um-hmm.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Noo!
МОНИКА: Okay, what do I want now?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision, and under Problems with Performance I wrote, Dear God, I hope not, and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
МОНИКА: That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uuuh! How about at a Footlocker?
МОНИКА: He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: See, I would never snap at you like that.
МОНИКА: Continue.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah.
МОНИКА: You and me! Let’s go! Right now!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
МОНИКА: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
МОНИКА: Wow, hes really not letting this go, is he?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.
МОНИКА: Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
МОНИКА: Let's take a look.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh I think we do.
МОНИКА: They gave us a fake number? Why would they do that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We’re back!
МОНИКА: We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! Let’s stay in the kitchen!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes!
МОНИКА: My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What's goin on, is, uh, Bobby drinking again?
МОНИКА: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
МОНИКА: I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt! Oh, this is yours.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No.
МОНИКА: Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Check out the rack on this chick!
МОНИКА: Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
МОНИКА: Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for.
МОНИКА: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because its awesome.

МОНИКА: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh hey!
МОНИКА: How’d your date go with Jake?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Mon!
МОНИКА: We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?</s>

МОНИКА: Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Anything I can do to help?
МОНИКА: Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but hes really into the game so I dont want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?</s>

МОНИКА: He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! You guys have such problems! I feel so terrible for you!
МОНИКА: Okay, IIm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, bye!
МОНИКА: Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You have three new messages.

<s>НЕДРУГ: That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
МОНИКА: Wh-what are we gonna tell him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.
МОНИКА: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.

МОНИКА: Then I’ve gotta go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, we never actually got to dinner.
МОНИКА: Ohhh, nice.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A test?!
МОНИКА: Tests make us all better learners! We should have essay questions!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I got you something from Vermont!
МОНИКА: Besides tampons and salt? Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird, it's empty!</s>

МОНИКА: And she wants to go hunting, too!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that s-that s when I really found my sound.

<s>НЕДРУГ: So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
МОНИКА: Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.

МОНИКА: I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em. Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women.
МОНИКА: I’m sorry too.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow. I thought that was an Alp!
МОНИКА: Well, high school was not my favourite time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
МОНИКА: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
МОНИКА: I have nothing left to teach you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
МОНИКА: Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!</s>

МОНИКА: Uh, would you stop it with that already?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
МОНИКА: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.</s>

МОНИКА: There were only twelve.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Say something clever! Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!

МОНИКА: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.</s>

МОНИКА: Oh, you're right.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
МОНИКА: It's gonna be really scary. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!?

МОНИКА: A love scene?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on, like you never talk that.
МОНИКА: I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
МОНИКА: How ya feelin'?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
МОНИКА: Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!</s>

МОНИКА: Hey, you wanna see something?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.
МОНИКА: Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing.</s>

МОНИКА: Hey, the man's dog just died.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

МОНИКА: All right, what about the third guy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Would you let me talk.
МОНИКА: Did you just flick me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
МОНИКА: It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye! I mean, it is so annoying.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, dinosaur attack! Quick, everybody into the house! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!

МОНИКА: Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
МОНИКА: Just for a little while.</s>

МОНИКА: Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.</s>

МОНИКА: Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
МОНИКА: Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Get your garlic-peelers off me!
МОНИКА: Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller. I'm the head chef here. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You do?
МОНИКА: You don’t? Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: That’s too hard. Too hard!
МОНИКА: All right boys, last chance for the tickets!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow! Skates!
МОНИКА: You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! What’s up Mon?
МОНИКА: Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?</s>

МОНИКА: How about, you’re moving!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: In a bad way?
МОНИКА: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.

МОНИКА: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!</s>

IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
МОНИКА: I hope Ross isn't too upset.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! No, the robots just work for them.
МОНИКА: All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?</s>

МОНИКА: So, what are we gonna do today?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
МОНИКА: Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You hated me when we were kids?
МОНИКА: I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.</s>

МОНИКА: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. RACHEL: Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? ROSS: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Wait, he's not here yet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well where's Amanda?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is.
МОНИКА: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.</s>

МОНИКА: Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
МОНИКА:? You faked it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
МОНИКА: Okay, be right back.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross!
МОНИКА: How crazy that we’d run into you!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
МОНИКА: Theyre mine!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
МОНИКА: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And we're changing.
МОНИКА: C'mon give me five more. Five more.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
МОНИКА: I’m fine.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why not?
МОНИКА: Bing's weird.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
МОНИКА: Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’ll be right with you.
МОНИКА: Cassie needs to stay at your place.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
МОНИКА: Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
МОНИКА: And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
МОНИКА: I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him help him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's.
МОНИКА: Then why would he say it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
МОНИКА: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
МОНИКА: You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe going into the robot, y’know?
МОНИКА: Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
МОНИКА: But I didn't.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
МОНИКА: Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
МОНИКА: Yeah, she's here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why!?
МОНИКА: I don't know why.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pheebs, I was wondering.
МОНИКА: You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well you might if it were anything like seven.
МОНИКА: All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
МОНИКА: You’re on the phone!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe, maybe low self esteem, maybe, maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe.
МОНИКА: Go back to that sibling thing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
МОНИКА: That's what it sounded like.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: AAAHHHH!
МОНИКА: I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He didnt say anything about that to me.
МОНИКА: What did he tell you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh Im sorry mummys so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep.
МОНИКА: Breaks your heart doesnt it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
МОНИКА: Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, II worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: They had to have that specially made?!
МОНИКА: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look at me!
МОНИКА: Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! You're-you're a cowboy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of I touch myself. Coming up next we've got Monica.
МОНИКА: I can't sing in front of all these people.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
МОНИКА: No, I haven't seen him.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Your outgoing message has now been changed.
МОНИКА: Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!</s>

МОНИКА: I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? Are you sure?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'm sure.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
МОНИКА: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
МОНИКА: You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? What happened?
МОНИКА: Well, I was dancing around, and singing No Woman, No Cry and I got stuck.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright. Thats it!
МОНИКА: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! They're really just trying to slap each other and just keep slapping their hands.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So what's going on?
МОНИКА: It's er. It's just, er. It's Roger.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh! You made up!
МОНИКА: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! You mean theyre not coming to a social event where theres no men and theres no booze?! Thats shocking! I dont care, as long as my moms here.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, your mother!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who gave you that hickey?
МОНИКА: That would be the work of a Blowfish.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: And I'm cute too.
МОНИКА: And you're cute too.</s>

МОНИКА: We are there!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay!
МОНИКА: No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!</s>

МОНИКА: Look alive! Come on, look alive!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing, why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.</s>

МОНИКА: Sometimes I have bad dreams.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.

<s>НЕДРУГ: The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
МОНИКА: 'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.

МОНИКА: But I want to.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
МОНИКА: I don’t know! I don’t maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
МОНИКА: Put that cigarette out!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
МОНИКА: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. I mean I’mI’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.</s>

МОНИКА: Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!</s>

МОНИКА: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.</s>

МОНИКА: You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who?
МОНИКА: He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?</s>

МОНИКА: Oh God…</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What's up?!
МОНИКА: I thought you had to do inventory all day.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
МОНИКА: That was so fake!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
МОНИКА: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Er, yeah, er, Joey said I could use your shower, since, er, Chandler's in ours.

МОНИКА: Alright, what was this sentence originally?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
МОНИКА: This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
МОНИКА: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh! Its horrible!

МОНИКА: I can't believe he did this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
МОНИКА: I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right then. Bye.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
МОНИКА: What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you serious?
МОНИКА: The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
МОНИКА: What if he reads it in the paper?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How come we have one extra place setting?
МОНИКА: 'Cause you invited your assistant.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So when do we get to meet the guy?
МОНИКА: Let's see, today's Monday.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not mine'.

<s>НЕДРУГ: You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
МОНИКА: Ohh, she's looking down the hall. She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
МОНИКА: II dontI dont think that Im gonna wear the boots tonight.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: You’re pregnant!
МОНИКА: Chandler and I are moving in together!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.

МОНИКА: Oh yeah right there!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nope, not under here!
МОНИКА: You didn't find her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
МОНИКА: Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. That wasn’t about the wedding.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well maybe it was all of your questions.
МОНИКА: What about my questions?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
МОНИКА: I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, okay.
МОНИКА: My job here is done.</s>

МОНИКА: Okay, umm, you’re a loon.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I, I, I'm hideous.
МОНИКА: It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Great, lets begin. Hows the pressure?
МОНИКА: Wow Phoebe you are good!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
МОНИКА: So-so you would’ve just lied?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
МОНИКА: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
МОНИКА: That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh, no! No! That’s art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
МОНИКА: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! My moms not gonna be here?!
МОНИКА: Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Thank you soo, much.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
МОНИКА: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
МОНИКА: I don’t know how any of these got opened?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Olivia.
МОНИКА: I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know we already went over this and I won!
МОНИКА: No you didn’t. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
МОНИКА: Bedsprings, unmistakable!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She's already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that -but, it's fine!
МОНИКА: Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good. But wrong.
МОНИКА: Ok first of all. It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.
МОНИКА: But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We re doomed. Okay, they re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
МОНИКА: Well, you could actually go to the gym.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whats going on?
МОНИКА: I cant walk. These boots were a huge mistake!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
МОНИКА: You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, water would be fine.
МОНИКА: I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
МОНИКА: Okay-okay, I got it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Tell him, tell him.
МОНИКА: Just please tell him.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
МОНИКА: Gimme ‘em!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?
МОНИКА: Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: There are seven?! That’s one?
МОНИКА: It’s kind of an important one!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica? Monica!
МОНИКА: Water rules!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you, are you high?
МОНИКА: I just had the most amazing bath.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and Oh My God!
МОНИКА: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: 150 pounds. Yeah, Im gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
МОНИКА: A pie!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.

Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I bet he can.
МОНИКА: Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you’re okay?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks. I'll see you new year's day.
МОНИКА: You're not gonna be here new year's eve?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
МОНИКА: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm I'm Monana!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
МОНИКА: Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hello!
МОНИКА: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
МОНИКА: So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
МОНИКА: Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well then definately don’t take his name.
МОНИКА: He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
МОНИКА: You broke a little girl's leg?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Mma, Mma, Mmaah.
МОНИКА: So, did I hear Poconos?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That was amazing.
МОНИКА: Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I did?
МОНИКА: What is she talking about?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, SmokesALot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
МОНИКА: This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Right. You know what? Actually I just got off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
МОНИКА: You don't need a shower.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
МОНИКА: I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef-.
МОНИКА: Who is also in charge of purchasing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
МОНИКА: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She did? Why?
МОНИКА: I made her. Steel drums don't really say elegant wedding. Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler loves marriage!
МОНИКА: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, we cant stay in here forever.
МОНИКА: Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
МОНИКА: Not you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
МОНИКА: When was this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Bunny!
МОНИКА: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Have a seat son. Hey!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: To the Bings!
МОНИКА: All right, Im gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, No! Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
МОНИКА: So the ball is in his court?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Ooh, I am still so mad at you for smoking.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Relax! We just get her some antacids.
МОНИКА: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Mmm hmmm.
МОНИКА: You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh! Really?!
МОНИКА: How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Na ha ha. Ne he he. Ah ah.
МОНИКА: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's right, I have a phone in here.
МОНИКА: Joey, promise me something.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh.
МОНИКА: How-how did that happen?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
МОНИКА: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I thought I was making him filet mignon?
МОНИКА: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Me too.
МОНИКА: Guys, we bought the tickets.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Jumping on the bed?
МОНИКА: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
МОНИКА: You're an opthamologist.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
МОНИКА: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
МОНИКА: That’s a good idea.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you gonna let me play?
МОНИКА: All right then.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica?
МОНИКА: Isn't that cute?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
МОНИКА: I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
МОНИКА: Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?
МОНИКА: Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
МОНИКА: Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
МОНИКА: Alright heres something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right. Did everyone get out okay?
МОНИКА: Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm okay.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, done.
МОНИКА: What’s ‘pleh’?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
МОНИКА: Can I talk to for just a minute? II dropped some socks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
МОНИКА: We could do it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is Rachel having the baby?
МОНИКА:! Its time!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
МОНИКА: But my clothes are-ohh!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
МОНИКА: So the going for help went well?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Me too!
МОНИКА: First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sex on the balcony?
МОНИКА: No, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay to come in?
МОНИКА: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Who do you wanna fool around with?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hell yeah! I’ll marry you!
МОНИКА: You can’t marry him!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
МОНИКА: No, I will not cave.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, Mon.
МОНИКА: Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So Pheebs, pick one of them.
МОНИКА: Which one do you like more?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now.
МОНИКА: Honey, whats going on?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Op.
МОНИКА: Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
МОНИКА: Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, what movie should we see?
МОНИКА: Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
МОНИКА: Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: What are you up too?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
МОНИКА: That sounds like Nana.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Actually, I don’t think we have to.
МОНИКА: We don’t?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!
МОНИКА: I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
МОНИКА: Vomit tux? Who vomited on, y'know what, what you up to Joe?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She keeps punching me.
МОНИКА: In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Working with blind kids.
МОНИКА: What are you doing to me?! I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
МОНИКА: Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. I know that.
МОНИКА: I so wanna be attracted to you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.
МОНИКА: You were invited?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
МОНИКА: I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on, Im your older brother, ask me!
МОНИКА: All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
МОНИКА: Okay, in we go.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.
МОНИКА: I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So you uh, want to do something tonight?
МОНИКА: Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait, you're not 'G. Stephanopoulos'? Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
МОНИКА: Did you say 'G.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?

МОНИКА: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How’s the hired help?
МОНИКА: Doing great, the quiches are coming along.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Not uh, not to my recollection.
МОНИКА: Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
МОНИКА: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
МОНИКА: Don't you want to look through the rest?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh!
МОНИКА: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?
МОНИКА: Half the guys out there have makeup on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know. You’re clothes aren’t funny.
МОНИКА: Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look I want you, now.
МОНИКА: You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
МОНИКА: Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
МОНИКА: Oh, I already have one.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What makes it pilgrim?
МОНИКА: We'll put buckles on it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him.
МОНИКА: Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! she.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
МОНИКА: I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Can we come in?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don't know, it looks the same.
МОНИКА: You used to have carpet.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Like okay III, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
МОНИКА: Which one is which again?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Quick! What time is it?!
МОНИКА: I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?</s>

МОНИКА: Ya know, I try to stay positive.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
МОНИКА: Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do, you gonna go do it now?
МОНИКА: We don't have much time. Once the egg decends into the ovaries.</s>

МОНИКА: Well, thanks, we like him.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
МОНИКА: Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
МОНИКА: Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
МОНИКА: A mirror?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Then, you will definitely get him back!
МОНИКА: Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
МОНИКА:! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Please?
МОНИКА: You really want me to come back?</s>

МОНИКА: What's with all this sand?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It isn't working.
МОНИКА: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
МОНИКА: That's probably what they'll say.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
МОНИКА: Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer.
МОНИКА: And the musicians, look, they can go over here Points to a little.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
МОНИКА: So what happened?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who the hell is this guy?
МОНИКА: Will! From high school.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
МОНИКА: Can we just start throwing things in?</s>

МОНИКА: Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.

МОНИКА: Here, why dont you let me do it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So ah, we on for tomorrow?
МОНИКА: Now get out of here you! Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are.
МОНИКА: Maye it's me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have plans.
МОНИКА: You’re plans were with us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here.
МОНИКА: Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow!
МОНИКА: Wow, what?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What’s my little chef got for me tonight?
МОНИКА: Your favorite!</s>

МОНИКА: Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my, you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch.
МОНИКА: You start working on that list.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, they are.
МОНИКА: How many fingers am I holding up?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
МОНИКА: You are not a freak. You're a guy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That’s what you said last night.
МОНИКА: What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Seriously?
МОНИКА: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
МОНИКА: It isn't mine!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
МОНИКА: Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
МОНИКА: Why else would you have made out with Ross?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
МОНИКА: This is the most special day of our lives.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, is this the recipe?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
МОНИКА: That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You are not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
МОНИКА: He asked you out?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
МОНИКА: Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I might have.
МОНИКА: I can't believe you didn't tell me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can.
МОНИКА: Yes, but we have to be fast.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That cup is mine!
МОНИКА: You want it, you're gonna have to win it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available.
МОНИКА:! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica and Chandler are living together!
МОНИКА: Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: They kept your room for a while.
МОНИКА: Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
МОНИКА: What a tragic loss!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you have any tissues?
МОНИКА: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
МОНИКА: You actually broke her watch?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
МОНИКА: I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
МОНИКА: Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, what about this? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: A real doctor?
МОНИКА: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
МОНИКА: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm, I'm 25, and thirteen months.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
МОНИКА: Which one was Pete Carney?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So you lied to me before?
МОНИКА: Well, we. bore false witness. See I could be a reverend.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Good.
МОНИКА: I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica!
МОНИКА: You came?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.
МОНИКА: Shes right there.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I feel like a snack!
МОНИКА: Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
МОНИКА: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
МОНИКА: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you run in the chapel!
МОНИКА: This is insane!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! No I'm not!
МОНИКА: It's good! It's good. It's a disease!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
МОНИКА: Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
МОНИКА: You don't know me at all!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
МОНИКА: I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
МОНИКА: About a week and a half.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You're right. Of course you're right.
МОНИКА: So we're back on?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Art.
МОНИКА: Art it is.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
МОНИКА: No-no-no, no!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi.
МОНИКА: Did she leave a number?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Yeah, were trying to get pregnant.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
МОНИКА: Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! II need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, I gotta! Unless.
МОНИКА: Unless what?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That yeti is one smooth talker.
МОНИКА: I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it’s like to be you?
МОНИКА: Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?!
МОНИКА: Why don't we start with a practice run?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
МОНИКА: That’s right! You lose sucker! Please still marry me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
МОНИКА: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi.
МОНИКА: Richard just told me he loves me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
МОНИКА: Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: I need to talk to you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you never told me how old you were.

МОНИКА: Ooh, I want one.</s>

МОНИКА: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica bang!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Why do I smell men's cologne?
МОНИКА: I think that's you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
