ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ll go get one.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, is she going back to him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, II thought I did but, II guess I did not!</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, Hey Toby, do you want a donut? And II wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! We only mess around at his place!

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, the old hug and roll.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The bigger half.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'll do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: MMe-me-me!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you aware that you're still talking?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Mmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im not going to let you say anything.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?

<s>НЕДРУГ: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna hug it out?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego, right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because it's faster.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have my reasons.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, what a line.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So where are you applying to?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah. What do you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it looks great. It's just that, well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Id move in tomorrow!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you listening to this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: At least let me smoke it to the good part.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about the obsessive cleaning?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How might you be wrong?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I quit and you learn what I do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin, abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s totally understandable.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a movie called benefits lapsed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start. Dear baby adoption decider people.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So excited about your letter!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, let’s play again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its a dead dog. Thats ChiChi she died when I was in high school.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk about their dead pet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Although, maybe just, one last moment of weakness. Goodbye Chandler Bing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're never coming down now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, she was definitely on my bed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are bad people.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What did you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said, Geez, relax Monnnnn.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well all right, one thing happened?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath. Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: D, how's it going, sir?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, let's see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We could trade later.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marry me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It wasnt fun?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why-why-would youWh-why Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I so am.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Meet me in the bathroom.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm going to the bathroom now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you figure out what I’m doing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cupping.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Poor Ross.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, so?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And now I’ve picked it up again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but this is Pete. He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know! I know its awful.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what did she say?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you’re not very good at it! I.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, me too. Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh sorry it s not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh,then no thanks. What the hell was that, mental note if Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it, if she offers you mangled animal carcass you take it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That’s a good one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I hate being left out of things.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Which is bad because-?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To be fair this one does have nuts.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you are about to marry a wonderful man! I’m marrying a dead woman!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Shh! Wait, what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do we do? What do we do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you doing here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is that a secret or a lie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I let him win—Ross!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You got it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t believe I ruined this.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is wrong with Emma?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooooohhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so you're divorced?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It still wouldn’t be clean. All I want is my freedom.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe is, making people.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean the spitter?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Can you blame him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say I do, he’s thinking, Yeah, I’d do her too!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Did Joey say what he was gonna do when he left?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another, and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device. And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard!'</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’d you rent?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok! I want the dolphin!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats a bear.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and 500.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey, is Monica here?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohhh, here it comes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, hey, they're runnin'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t want him to tell this story for years.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it’s flattering!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't-I just, I can't get her out of my head. I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. We still love you Chandler!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Exactly!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, what're you, what're you, what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I want to watch this. Did your cable go out?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know III haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favour!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joseph's good, isn't he?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm going to kill you.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait, wait, wait!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Monica…</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Id shake your hand but uh Im really into the game. Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to each other.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that’s a full cup!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't come any closer!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sorry, I just. I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously, we're gonna do this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Oranges!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice to see you again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what was it for anyway?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know, it is isn’t it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! Wow! Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh, I am still so mad at you for smoking.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes, no big deal.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I guess so.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's insane!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Art lover!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't do what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have to! It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, she tried to undress me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I used to undress my cousin Glenn.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Noo! Angels.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m gettin’ my chair back!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Five more and I'll flash you.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened to him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was there! I know he's the love of your life.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m sorry man. You wanna go watch?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You you break the.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought I had to make the jokes!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, seriously.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl, Joey was unconscious.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! III lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, this does butch it up a bit.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So how's it going there in Financial Services?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh that is quite all right ma’am.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is the worst Christmas ever.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! No! No! No, one can beat me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: So that’s the girl you like.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe she cracked your code!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, so what's it about?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: She's bluffing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then don't leave me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: My fish, Buddy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There was no fish when she dropped it off.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, how many have you sold so far?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wow!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's the right thing to do.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't think I thought of that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?! What are you doing?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you know what just happened?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So is there like a story or do they just start doing it right, oh, never mind.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Perfect decibel.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You don’t need to fill these silences.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay, thanks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if Joey were president?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really stupid.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you feel like a dad yet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh great!

<s>НЕДРУГ: They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice! I need juice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can’t!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He has your eyes.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So you were right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, how long is this going to go on.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its still there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mrs. Braverman must be out.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I sleep on your couch?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You were gonna propose?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nah, not my game.

<s>НЕДРУГ: You idiot!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sure you're right, but why?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Right, yeah, 'cause it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyour bottom dollar that tomorrow therell be sun.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah-yeah, me neither.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh boy, me too!

ЧЕНДЛЕР: What else is new?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, here's a question where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Whoa, what, what d. What were you doing seeing her boobies?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don't, really.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Good-bye muscles!

ЧЕНДЛЕР: He has a caretaker. His older brother.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re doing the right thing, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР:! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you supporting?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We'll see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know the hotels?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.

<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry. I’mI’mI’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And a lot could still get in our way.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: And it works both ways.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, let me see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: With such a sad history.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could there be more Kims?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Soon! II just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Joey’s my best friend.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, II can't really put a price on that Joe.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror, as he is me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.

<s>НЕДРУГ: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, I’m sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What-what-whats that now?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were ready.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we cant stay in here forever.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I’m gonna kill myself! I’ll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: OK, then, eat me, I'm done.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Let’s go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that your new walk?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, can I just say something? II know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, well, I expect this from her. She's always been a Freudian nightmare.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna see if we still have it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And what did you bring?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Good luck!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: There was a scene in Footloose.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Flashdance.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That saves us a conversation.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, look II know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s not all juice!</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your work makes me sad.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.

<s>НЕДРУГ: What is the big deal? It s not like we re exclusive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she s-she s smart, and funny, and gets you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is just.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.

<s>НЕДРУГ: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it was me. I over reacted.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: They're gonna call her Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that doesn't scare you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.

<s>НЕДРУГ: What's the matter?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If onlythere was something in your head to control the things you say.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm adopted?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got nothing.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: You already know.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He started mine first!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little. I’m a little embarrassed about it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You got me a cola drink?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And, a lemon lime.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face. And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you’d believe that. This sucks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, II’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: You gotta see what Emma just did.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right. I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I. It kills me that I can't give her a baby. I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife, she's already there. She's a mother, without a baby. Please?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You still want that baby?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't have a page.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: You know what I mean. About how I'm always going out with all these women, and I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand up guy, and go the distance, you know. I'm looking at my Dad, thinking.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you are not him, you're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business, did you cave?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Are you kidding?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah! I bet I can do it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, we owe you a present.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah let’s head off to work.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you should here me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Im telling you, just a little bit at a time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, whats the next little bit?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I do not have baby fever!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, no How you doing? Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The nerve huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Who's that dirty old lady?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica's grandmother.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, no.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but Joey that's who.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That sounds like fun.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Can I ask you something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, no.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You-you didn't say it was going to be at night time.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did you just do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do we have a baby name yet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this,</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How'd the interview go?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is anybody else scared?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh, thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No, happy for you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You guys! Come on!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She mustve been planning this for years!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: He's retiling my floor.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Spackel boy!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Eh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh please, hit by a blimp?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It kills over one americans every year.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we cant guarantee a private room and currently theyre all unavailable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, if only youd gotten here sooner.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: People need juice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen to me!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, II booked the Swing Kings.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. All right I gotta go to work.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you singing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's very nice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's sweet, Joey.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Without my toe?! I need my toe!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than. Ohhh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, this isn't over?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s the perfect amount!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E.!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Paris?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Lets.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you have the baby yet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Can't we just use a pen?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, Amish boy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Apology accepted. Excuse us.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You told her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nancy Thompson’s getting fired!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Excellent!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Go take the test and see if we're okay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as. gay as the day is long?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, opposite, is opposite!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's got nothing!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Uh-hmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let’s have Monica decide.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What the hell is that dog doing here?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: NOW!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, II considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean scared.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I've never wanted you more.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question, you're going crazy.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Feminine stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And yet I never run into Beyonce!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No. Sorry man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can see the headline now: Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That is so sweet!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Still terrified, I'll take care of it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What happened?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, I got to apologise on the behalf of Carl.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who the hell is Carl?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was pretty intense huh?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Get out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This sounds like a hernia. You have to, you-you go to the doctor!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So I can do it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah you can do it.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, So you can move them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, thanks again for lunch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, this, this was pleasant.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean a three pointer?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're married that's what's wrong.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh so there cant be any yelling.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey! Happy Anniversary!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy Anniversary, 10 months!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God, I thought… Wait a minute, II can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Everyone. Erica, baby!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Calm, self.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Huh, didn’t see that coming.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need——There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: The second guy.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: No!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Quick!!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm kinda beat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, me too.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this because of the burrito thing?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep, I'm in a tree.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Nooo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no no no, we're done.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay that’s so generous!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I think Ross is generous too.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What did you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'. I can grow a moustache!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes out. You snooze you lose.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you guys know any cute guys?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I don't wanna do it in a cup!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights, does it get better than this?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So are things with you and Joey any better?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What is that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it’s the dying cat parade.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's, there's an Ethan?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you think?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What do you mean?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Is Joey here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont see him. Do you see him?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Paid your phone bill?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t, she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yes! Why, did you, you forget to make yours?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where II made it and pick-pick it up.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ready?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Er, hum!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im leaning. This is where I lean.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s no question.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You got a better idea?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, call it in the air.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really know what I was saying.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You both wanna do it? Uhm, there's only room for one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Why do men keep talking to me like this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What does she mean by HH?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It means we're holding hands.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm, I'm okay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You do?!

<s>НЕДРУГ: 007 has a fancy car!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Batman has the Batmobile!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did you do when they found out?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!

<s>НЕДРУГ: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Count of three?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well this is just sad!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What gave me away?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh no! What’s the matter?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not Archie Comic funny.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: This is harder than I thought it would be.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it's gonna be okay.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, none for me. Thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just a little bit of sugar.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Did she just ask me out on a date?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t think so.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! Oyster?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? When?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell me what?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: What else did you think about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.</s>

My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's what we do. Y'know, II mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: You slept with the stripper?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Ooh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's…. You did you come up with that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already! Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Cool! I'll catch up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.

<s>НЕДРУГ: Actually, I did!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look like?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?

I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I. It kills me that I can't give her a baby. I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife, she's already there. She's a mother, without a baby.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyre not in the baby buying business.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too huge.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How is that ever going to happen?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people… come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.

<s>НЕДРУГ: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ohh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? II really need to talk to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: That's what I said.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, maybe we should go?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I know! That's why we got to find Monica! You know where she is?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Honey, listen. You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is he funnier than me?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello, children!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's the foosball table.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know, finding gold.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think we're making too big a deal out of this. So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef, what can you make out of backing soda and beer?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A vending machine?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Somebody got a haircut.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that-yes.</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, are you going to be able to do this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not well.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: WHOAA!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: What are you saying?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey said that you're in here with another man.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: But you are a liar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did I just say?</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!</s>

ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what are you going to do?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re our age!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I be that guy?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.</s>

<s>НЕДРУГ: It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: So far so good!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, I'm old!</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands.

<s>НЕДРУГ: No, you're right. We shouldn't do it like this. Huh. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, it's not the end of the world.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean it?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You think we're ready for something like that?</s>
<s>НЕДРУГ: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
