<s>NOTFRIEND: Why not?
CHANDLER: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I’ll go get one.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
CHANDLER: Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
CHANDLER: Well, I have a call in about that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You gotta take the canoe!
CHANDLER: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.

CHANDLER: Ehh, you're just liquored up.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: This bicep?
CHANDLER: Well it's not flexed right now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah she said something about crumbies.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah?
CHANDLER: Would you tell her I let you win please?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
CHANDLER: You don't trust him?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.
CHANDLER: Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oops! Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
CHANDLER: You are totally and completely 100 forgiven.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Um, you see, I'm ovulating.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
CHANDLER: Im going to need a bigger boat.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, it was an accident. You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
CHANDLER: Have I got a surprise for you! Pack your bags!</s>

CHANDLER: Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I wasn't sleeping.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head.
CHANDLER: Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
CHANDLER: You're Jewish.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Poo?
CHANDLER: Oh my God this doesnt count! The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!
CHANDLER: 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
CHANDLER: Let me see this guy. Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the WHWow!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God, is she going back to him?
CHANDLER: She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!

<s>NOTFRIEND: It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow. RICHARD: Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand. CHANDLER: So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. MONICA: Why?
CHANDLER: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. PHOEBE: Why would you kill his fish?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no, we cant walk!
CHANDLER: What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets go.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
CHANDLER: Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.
CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?

CHANDLER: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime, HBL and Cinemax.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.
CHANDLER: Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You think?
CHANDLER: Oh-no, he's right.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks!
CHANDLER: Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What about the chairs?
CHANDLER: She picked those out too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It was, it was her voice.
CHANDLER: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay!
CHANDLER: Someone’s killed Square Man!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.
CHANDLER: She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, ah, Ive been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, its not my fault. Its a natural instinct.
CHANDLER: Hey, what you guys talking about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, what's goin' on?
CHANDLER: Joey's tailor took advantage of me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.

CHANDLER: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this! You are surprisingly strong!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know it's twins, right?
CHANDLER: These are the faces of two people in the know!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar.
CHANDLER: Did you not hear me say, Du-ude?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
CHANDLER: That was like 5 years ago.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Lovely!
CHANDLER: Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, why don’t you correct him?
CHANDLER: Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, Hey Toby, do you want a donut? And II wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! We only mess around at his place!
CHANDLER: Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scaring me. So could you come out here please?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, we’ll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
CHANDLER: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, this one I like!
CHANDLER: Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
CHANDLER: Okay, the old hug and roll.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The bigger half.
CHANDLER: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'll do it!
CHANDLER: MMe-me-me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He took my snack!
CHANDLER: I’m not getting into this again!</s>

CHANDLER: I can't even remember what we were fighting about!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
CHANDLER: When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
CHANDLER: Are you aware that you're still talking?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Mmm.
CHANDLER: Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Amen.
CHANDLER: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.

CHANDLER: Out loud?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
CHANDLER: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around.
CHANDLER: You wanna see what it looks like?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
CHANDLER: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh.
CHANDLER: Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
CHANDLER: Im not going to let you say anything.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
CHANDLER: Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
CHANDLER: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ready!
CHANDLER: Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Harddd,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!'
CHANDLER: He paints quite a picture doesn't he?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
CHANDLER: Oh you knew that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Get a room!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!

CHANDLER: You be cool. He opens the door and lets her in as.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I knew it! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Get down?
CHANDLER: And boogie!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Look!
CHANDLER: This is not going to work.</s>

CHANDLER: Look, shes really nice. And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there.

<s>NOTFRIEND: You mean like, music?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I know what you re thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey. Where's Joey?
CHANDLER: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
CHANDLER: Who’s gonna watch that?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 'My scones.'
CHANDLER: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! Let’s stay in the kitchen!

CHANDLER: I don’t think you can do that!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He's, new.
CHANDLER: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
CHANDLER: Did I go to this school?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
CHANDLER: Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
CHANDLER: At a fake game!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful.
CHANDLER: Oh, beautiful? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
CHANDLER: Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross,there was a phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
CHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I’m sorry man. Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
CHANDLER: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
CHANDLER: Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay!
CHANDLER: You wanna hug it out?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego, right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
CHANDLER: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because it's faster.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
CHANDLER: I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, I am so so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
CHANDLER: I don’t care, she slept with me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi!
CHANDLER: Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.</s>

CHANDLER: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
CHANDLER: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?
CHANDLER: I have my reasons.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the hot nanny.
CHANDLER: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. Mr. FuzzyMan, how are you doing? Aww. Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh-huh.
CHANDLER: And I will cook anything you want in here, and do anything in there!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
CHANDLER: That's what they'll call us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
CHANDLER: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, what a line.
CHANDLER: So where are you applying to?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah. What do you think?
CHANDLER: Well, it looks great. It's just that, well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I took a shot.
CHANDLER: Are you sure it was Althea?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like, like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy. Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
CHANDLER: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What, uh, what juggling thing?
CHANDLER: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: OOkay!
CHANDLER: Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! It's on! It's on!
CHANDLER: There we go little fella.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
CHANDLER: There has got to be a way!</s>

CHANDLER: This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it MaryAngela?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's the rule.
CHANDLER: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
CHANDLER: And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Id move in tomorrow!
CHANDLER: Are you listening to this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler!
CHANDLER: At least let me smoke it to the good part.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
CHANDLER: What about the obsessive cleaning?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How might you be wrong?
CHANDLER: Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: THAT'S NOT ME!
CHANDLER: That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.

<s>NOTFRIEND: What’s up?
CHANDLER: I can’t figure out what to make Monica.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
CHANDLER: I quit and you learn what I do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin, abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
CHANDLER: You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
CHANDLER: Okay, it’s just weird! I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! III need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, baths are so relaxing!
CHANDLER: You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man.
CHANDLER: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
CHANDLER: Youre turning into a woman.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I swear I didnt know she was a hooker! I mean whDid you let her smoke in here?
CHANDLER: Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?</s>

CHANDLER: I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, so?
CHANDLER: And now I’ve picked it up again.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.
CHANDLER: Yes, but this is Pete. He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
CHANDLER: Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! I know its awful.
CHANDLER: Well, what did she say?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you’re not very good at it! I.
CHANDLER: Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Which is bad because-?
CHANDLER: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
CHANDLER: To be fair this one does have nuts.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.

CHANDLER: What do we do? What do we do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you doing here?
CHANDLER: Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?</s>

CHANDLER: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your.
CHANDLER: The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
CHANDLER: So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.
CHANDLER: You mean the spitter?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
CHANDLER: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Can you blame him?
CHANDLER: Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say I do, he’s thinking, Yeah, I’d do her too!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Did Joey say what he was gonna do when he left?
CHANDLER: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another, and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
CHANDLER: Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device. And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard!'</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
CHANDLER: What’d you rent?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, hey, they're runnin'
CHANDLER: See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny he’ll be telling this story for years!
CHANDLER: I don’t want him to tell this story for years.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
CHANDLER: We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.</s>

CHANDLER: You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that uhm, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.

CHANDLER: What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ew! Gross. Amy runs towards Rachel and Rachel puts her arm out, hand on Amy's head and Amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, Rachel is moving backwards towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to.
CHANDLER: That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
CHANDLER: I was there! I know he's the love of your life.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I’m sorry man. You wanna go watch?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
CHANDLER: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
CHANDLER: I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, Chandler.
CHANDLER: So how's it going there in Financial Services?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No.
CHANDLER: Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
CHANDLER: Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh that is quite all right ma’am.
CHANDLER: So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is the worst Christmas ever.
CHANDLER: Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! No! No! No, one can beat me.
CHANDLER: Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
CHANDLER: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart! Come!
CHANDLER: So that’s the girl you like.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
CHANDLER: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
CHANDLER: Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
CHANDLER: I can't believe she cracked your code!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.
CHANDLER: And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
CHANDLER: Alright, so what's it about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She's bluffing!
CHANDLER: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
CHANDLER: Im so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
CHANDLER: Then don't leave me!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: My fish, Buddy.
CHANDLER: There was no fish when she dropped it off.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department.
CHANDLER: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, apparently she does.
CHANDLER: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh God!
CHANDLER: So, how many have you sold so far?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow!
CHANDLER: It's the right thing to do.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
CHANDLER: You don't think I thought of that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! What are you doing?!
CHANDLER: Do you know what just happened?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So is there like a story or do they just start doing it right, oh, never mind.
CHANDLER: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
CHANDLER: Perfect decibel.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You don’t need to fill these silences.
CHANDLER: Oh, okay, thanks.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
CHANDLER: What if Joey were president?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
CHANDLER: Really stupid.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now.
CHANDLER: So, you feel like a dad yet?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh great!
CHANDLER: It’s got your wavy black lines!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And?. AND?
CHANDLER: I'm a pretty little girl.</s>

CHANDLER: Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice! I need juice!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
CHANDLER: He has your eyes.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So you were right?
CHANDLER: I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
CHANDLER: Okay, how long is this going to go on.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its still there!
CHANDLER: Mrs. Braverman must be out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!

CHANDLER: Can I sleep on your couch?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You were gonna propose?
CHANDLER: Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nah, not my game.
CHANDLER: Okay, uh, how about, how about y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
CHANDLER: Work people? Nobody told me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
CHANDLER: Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You idiot!
CHANDLER: I'm sure you're right, but why?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Right, yeah, 'cause it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
CHANDLER: Can we start over?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
CHANDLER: Well ah,, y'know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
CHANDLER: What else is new?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
CHANDLER: There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with.
CHANDLER: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
CHANDLER: Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
CHANDLER: Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
CHANDLER: Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, here's a question where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
CHANDLER: Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
CHANDLER: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
CHANDLER: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa, what, what d. What were you doing seeing her boobies?
CHANDLER: It was an accident. It's not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
CHANDLER: We don't, really.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Good-bye muscles!
CHANDLER: I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just. I didn't know what it was!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is he alright out there by himself?
CHANDLER: He has a caretaker. His older brother.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
CHANDLER: We’re doing the right thing, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
CHANDLER:! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
CHANDLER: What are you supporting?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We'll see.
CHANDLER: OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
CHANDLER: It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
CHANDLER: You know the hotels?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.

<s>NOTFRIEND: You ate meat! You had sex!
CHANDLER: No we didn't!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: My God, Joey!
CHANDLER: It was a car backfire!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, is Chandler here?
CHANDLER: No, no he went for a walk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
CHANDLER: I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
CHANDLER: I’m sorry. I’mI’mI’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
CHANDLER: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And a lot could still get in our way.
CHANDLER: I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
CHANDLER: I didn't think I was!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
CHANDLER: Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
CHANDLER: They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
CHANDLER: I'm over here big guy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whats wrong with being the Bings?
CHANDLER: The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure.
CHANDLER: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus!
CHANDLER: Madre Sierra the of Treasure!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
CHANDLER: I don't believe they're brother and sister.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
CHANDLER: The cushions are the essence of the chair!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
CHANDLER: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead. This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Or we could just follow your clever jokes, any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!
CHANDLER: Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler?
CHANDLER: So, uh, how often can you do it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor Victoria!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright mister, let's see those panties.
CHANDLER: Alrighty.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sounds like he's with someone.
CHANDLER: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, II dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that.
CHANDLER: You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Guys, you got your hair cut.
CHANDLER: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh, 10:30.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
CHANDLER: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No.
CHANDLER: That new mountain bike?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I remember when we first got engaged.
CHANDLER: Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
CHANDLER: But Im only doing this for you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bonjour, monsieur.
CHANDLER: Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
CHANDLER: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its awfully pink.

If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down and kick your ass! What? ImImIm serious! ComeHey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? ImIm not kidding here!
CHANDLER: Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?
CHANDLER: What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You dated her!
CHANDLER: Not once!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I thought you already have a job.
CHANDLER: And people say you dont pay attention. No, this is a much better job. Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
CHANDLER: Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
CHANDLER: Well, now, I actually have to get to work.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
CHANDLER: Twenty-three! Seventy-four!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh-huh.
CHANDLER: Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You fell asleep! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later.
CHANDLER: Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
CHANDLER: Well, first of all, they're not called sneakers anymore. Apparently, they're called kicks or skids and I think I heard somebody say slorps. And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then.
CHANDLER: Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Excellent, that was excellent.
CHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
CHANDLER: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Trust me, you can't talk to her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nope.
CHANDLER: Do I still call you Ross?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
CHANDLER: You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not for the next few minutes.
CHANDLER: During this timeare you, are you still my best man?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
CHANDLER: Ooh, I dont know if were there yet.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Has it always been purple?
CHANDLER: Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Can I see the comics?
CHANDLER: This is the New York Times.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
CHANDLER: Well, I think it's very brave what you said.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
CHANDLER: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.

CHANDLER: Hey, man!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but, it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
CHANDLER: What bed did you say she was on?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
CHANDLER: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I slept with Monica.
CHANDLER: Well let's let's see what everybody thinks of that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well then, do it better!
CHANDLER: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ahhhhh!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
CHANDLER: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
CHANDLER: And what did you bring?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Good luck!
CHANDLER: Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, look II know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…
CHANDLER: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
CHANDLER: Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you ok?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I m fine. I m trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Is your team winning hon?
CHANDLER: Anderson just scored again! Theres no Anderson.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, they look too weird.

CHANDLER: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
CHANDLER: Can I see the book?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.</s>

CHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you okay?
CHANDLER: Totally, and you?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!

<s>NOTFRIEND: You knew about that?
CHANDLER: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know. He has your eyes.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. II've been given the gift of time!
CHANDLER: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, you lied to him?
CHANDLER: It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. Except with you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.

<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I stuff outside the bra.
CHANDLER: Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!

CHANDLER: That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! That’s even worse!
CHANDLER: How is that worse?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God, is it really that bad?
CHANDLER: I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey, man.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Well, those were seals, man.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?! Tonight?!

CHANDLER: I think I do!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!

<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know.
CHANDLER: Richard used to do it, didn't he?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What. I could, I could do it. What is it?
CHANDLER: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs reduced. It's a whole big boob story.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I said name one!
CHANDLER: I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing, remember Andrea Rich?
CHANDLER: The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, uh. Chandler got you a gift, too.
CHANDLER: No he didn't.</s>

CHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, she was here, but she left.
CHANDLER: Well where did she go?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! How'd you get in there?
CHANDLER: Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.

CHANDLER: I think I have something that belongs to you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
CHANDLER: That is lucky.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
CHANDLER: I wouldn't read too much into it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nope, got it and I got yours too.
CHANDLER: Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
CHANDLER: Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'll take it down to 95 but that's the best I can do.
CHANDLER: Oopsey, missed it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How did she get me to settle down?
CHANDLER: Allright, I'm gonna watch it. I mean look, it's probably not.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?

CHANDLER: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
CHANDLER: Your work makes me sad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
CHANDLER: Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.

CHANDLER: OK, Pheebs, your turn.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
CHANDLER: Is someone on the line?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Foot rubs for a month!
CHANDLER: Freedom!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
CHANDLER: Smooth.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, it’s a funny story.
CHANDLER: Funny: ha-ha or funny:</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: and head to Canada!
CHANDLER: I was kidding.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
CHANDLER: Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
CHANDLER: Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?TILLY:</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What is the big deal? It s not like we re exclusive.

CHANDLER: This is just.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
CHANDLER: Can I use your phone?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.
CHANDLER: Kick save and, denied.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You serious?!
CHANDLER: That’s great!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, call me if you change your mind.
CHANDLER: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.

CHANDLER: It's not gonna be exactly like last time.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Should we do something?
CHANDLER: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
CHANDLER: Oh, the mixed tape.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
CHANDLER: No, it was me. I over reacted.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: They're gonna call her Chandler.
CHANDLER: That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
CHANDLER: And that doesn't scare you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!
CHANDLER: No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
CHANDLER: Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
CHANDLER: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What's the matter?!
CHANDLER: We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
CHANDLER: If onlythere was something in your head to control the things you say.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.
CHANDLER: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
CHANDLER: It’s a sock bunny.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
CHANDLER: I know that one! No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm adopted?
CHANDLER: I got nothing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
CHANDLER: I'm not mad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You’ll tell me later?
CHANDLER: You already know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
CHANDLER: He started mine first!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell!
CHANDLER: So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little. I’m a little embarrassed about it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You got me a cola drink?
CHANDLER: And, a lemon lime.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We can go into detail.
CHANDLER: No dont I beg of you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
CHANDLER: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
CHANDLER: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face. And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
CHANDLER: What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you’d believe that. This sucks!
CHANDLER: Look, II’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, how'd she take it?
CHANDLER: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Turn! Turn!
CHANDLER: Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. Oh no, I have to.

CHANDLER: Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby, baby.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: YEAH!
CHANDLER: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
CHANDLER: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe.
CHANDLER: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.
CHANDLER: And Milton Berle has a.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
CHANDLER: You gotta see what Emma just did.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right. I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I. It kills me that I can't give her a baby. I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife, she's already there. She's a mother, without a baby. Please?
CHANDLER: You still want that baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
CHANDLER:! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you okay?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
CHANDLER: Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
CHANDLER: I don't have a page.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
CHANDLER: Yes, it is, at Office Max.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on, it’s not that big a deal!
CHANDLER: Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
CHANDLER: You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man!
CHANDLER: I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!
CHANDLER: You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
CHANDLER: But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You were my first kiss ever?
CHANDLER: What did I marry into?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You may be a sissy but I'll still. All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one.
CHANDLER: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
CHANDLER: Horn-swoggle.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one?

CHANDLER: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, aint that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright. See, heres the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me go there!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You're kidding? She seems so.
CHANDLER: Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I give you 500 for them!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Wha. How the hell is that gonna help?
CHANDLER: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!
CHANDLER: Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The fear?
CHANDLER: He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
CHANDLER: Y'know, II could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Her answer machine?

CHANDLER: How’s your room Rach?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Here he is.
CHANDLER: Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So? You had sex, right?
CHANDLER: What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!

CHANDLER: But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?
CHANDLER: Was that another question?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sorry, uh. I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know. Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
CHANDLER: Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The little jail between the doors!
CHANDLER: Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
CHANDLER: I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
CHANDLER: And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It does in mine!
CHANDLER: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, lets talk about something else.
CHANDLER: Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I think we proved our point.
CHANDLER: You burn your mouth?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
CHANDLER: Have fun at church-camp!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?
CHANDLER: You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
CHANDLER: Take off their hats!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.
CHANDLER: It is when you put it together with that one.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
CHANDLER: Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Aww, man!
CHANDLER: Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.</s>

CHANDLER: Hey, you are not him, you're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business, did you cave?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you kidding?
CHANDLER: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than. Ohhh!
CHANDLER: So, this isn't over?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
CHANDLER: Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
CHANDLER: That’s the perfect amount!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E.!
CHANDLER: Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.

CHANDLER: Go take the test and see if we're okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as. gay as the day is long?
CHANDLER: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, opposite, is opposite!
CHANDLER: He's got nothing!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh-hmm.

CHANDLER: Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
CHANDLER: Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What the hell is that dog doing here?!
CHANDLER: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: NOW!
CHANDLER: So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, II considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
CHANDLER: You mean scared.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I've never wanted you more.
CHANDLER: So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question, you're going crazy.</s>

CHANDLER: When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right.
CHANDLER: Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Feminine stuff.
CHANDLER: Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
CHANDLER: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
CHANDLER: And yet I never run into Beyonce!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. Sorry man.
CHANDLER: They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
CHANDLER: I can see the headline now: Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That is so sweet!
CHANDLER: Still terrified, I'll take care of it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
CHANDLER: Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why not?
CHANDLER: I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What happened?
CHANDLER: He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
CHANDLER: I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
CHANDLER: Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on.
CHANDLER: That was pretty intense huh?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
CHANDLER: Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Get out.
CHANDLER: No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
CHANDLER: You mean a three pointer?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
CHANDLER: You're married that's what's wrong.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
CHANDLER: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.</s>

CHANDLER: Happy Anniversary, 10 months!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
CHANDLER: Oh God, I thought… Wait a minute, II can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.</s>

CHANDLER: Calm, self.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh, didn’t see that coming.

CHANDLER: Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
CHANDLER: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
CHANDLER: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights, does it get better than this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So are things with you and Joey any better?

CHANDLER: We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.
CHANDLER: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
CHANDLER: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
CHANDLER: So, what do you think?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What do you mean?
CHANDLER: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Is Joey here?
CHANDLER: I dont see him. Do you see him?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sure.
CHANDLER: Paid your phone bill?</s>

CHANDLER: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
CHANDLER: There’s no question.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You got a better idea?
CHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?

CHANDLER: Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, If it helps!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.

CHANDLER: That was her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
CHANDLER: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
CHANDLER: I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its the salts.
CHANDLER: Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
CHANDLER: Yknow, that party wasnt bad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Really?
CHANDLER: When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
CHANDLER: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's right. Is it true the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
CHANDLER: Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started by taking a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
CHANDLER: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
CHANDLER: Weird world. Your kids?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler! Everyone-no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!

CHANDLER: What’s this?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: That’s fine!
CHANDLER: That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally believe everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
CHANDLER: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
CHANDLER: Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
CHANDLER: Fine, I'll give the suit back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's an unpaid internship.
CHANDLER: It's funny. When you said unpaid it sounded like you said unpaid.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's this way? Sorry.
CHANDLER: I'm right! There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa. And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, II really think that you should apologize to Julie.
CHANDLER: That was like 16 years ago.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
CHANDLER: Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it. I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
CHANDLER: Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok. You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
CHANDLER: Well yes yes. You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: uhu uhu, check this out.
CHANDLER: So that's what I would look like if I worked out, and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?</s>

CHANDLER: Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps. She knows!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, II don’t think there’s any trail.
CHANDLER: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How is that gonna happen?
CHANDLER: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?</s>

CHANDLER: What is so funny about that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, what's the matter?
CHANDLER: I just saw Janice.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That can’t be your father.
CHANDLER: Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I. Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
CHANDLER: That ripped! That ripped real nice!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Unless. Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
CHANDLER: Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start, canoodling in it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio.
CHANDLER: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
CHANDLER: I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to stop catching on fire.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: My lighter’s in there!
CHANDLER: The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: A lot of other gas smells.
CHANDLER: Oh the humanity.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
CHANDLER: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
CHANDLER: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? I don't really feel like it.
CHANDLER: This is what I want to do.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
CHANDLER: I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I ordered mine first.
CHANDLER: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
CHANDLER: I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well that's pathetic!
CHANDLER: Again true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey!
CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
CHANDLER: Who did you originally want to hook up with?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really, you want to wait a year?
CHANDLER: It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. Pants. Like shorts, but longer. It'll probably be more than a year.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all I did was think about it.
CHANDLER: You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
CHANDLER: Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.</s>

CHANDLER: You’re a little high maintenance.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hello?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Let's get out of here.
CHANDLER: The one time they're not home.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
CHANDLER: I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: If you want to check your email, just ask!
CHANDLER: May I?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: I am Father Kalebasous.
CHANDLER: Hes Greek Orthodox.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How? How is your fault?
CHANDLER: Because, II should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
CHANDLER: Worse than, More turkey Mr.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would ve just stepped aside.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
CHANDLER: Move over! Move over now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I tried! They won't take her back.
CHANDLER: Maybe that's because she's a minion of the antiChrist.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I'll do it.
CHANDLER: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hello.
CHANDLER: I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Huh?
CHANDLER: You said no right?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
CHANDLER: Rachel, could I see you for a moment?</s>

And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Rach?! Rachel!? So I can't do anything I like?
CHANDLER: Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Since when are you into swing music?
CHANDLER: Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey guys.
CHANDLER: Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Iced tea.
CHANDLER: Okay, anything for you sir?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, you didn’t get one.
CHANDLER: Okay, well tonight’s the big night.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, what are you talking about?
CHANDLER: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
CHANDLER: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you serious?!
CHANDLER: I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
CHANDLER: Wow, this is weird.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hard to say.
CHANDLER: Your cappucino sir.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, it's getting late.
CHANDLER: Yeah, we're gonna go.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: oo London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
CHANDLER: Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler!
CHANDLER: Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman, who also liked her, so.
CHANDLER: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
CHANDLER: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Saw your head. Saw your head.
CHANDLER: Awful play, man. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
CHANDLER: Do I look fat?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No-no.
CHANDLER: No, we d just like to close them.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You guys ready to go?
CHANDLER: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
CHANDLER: He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, so, what’d ya think?
CHANDLER: Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just.
CHANDLER: Run you crazy, rich freak!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey! You ready to go?
CHANDLER: Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
CHANDLER: Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What’s the matter?
CHANDLER: I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
CHANDLER: Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
CHANDLER: How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oww!
CHANDLER: What’s the matter honey?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.
CHANDLER: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y'know if we ever go to war and you re captured, you re in for a big surprise.
CHANDLER: It just keeps getting worse and worse! I mean it s bad enough that I m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we re in the room together there s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she s smooth! Smooth!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why not?
CHANDLER: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my butt cheek is waking up! Oh!
CHANDLER: I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What a phony.
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
CHANDLER: Centerpieces!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.
CHANDLER: I’m marrying her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: If you wanna call that a reason.
CHANDLER: Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Going out with who?
CHANDLER: Uh, Dana Keystone from college.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Come on.
CHANDLER: Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you okay?
CHANDLER: I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything are you are you perrr-perfect?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?
CHANDLER: That is true.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
CHANDLER: Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I gotta go to work.
CHANDLER: And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So are guys doing okay?
CHANDLER: Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Two.
CHANDLER: Can Joey and I put them on and fight?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi.
CHANDLER: Hey Ross, bahhhh!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, Yeah, absolutely!
CHANDLER: I'll catch you guys later.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
CHANDLER: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
CHANDLER: They’re really big.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Baywatch.
CHANDLER: What’s it about?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
CHANDLER: I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
CHANDLER: I’m just eating candy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
CHANDLER: Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, you’re like a zillionaire?
CHANDLER: And you’re our age. You’re our age.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What is that?
CHANDLER: Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
CHANDLER: Yes that would have made more sense.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, why would you do that?
CHANDLER: Because its awesome.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
CHANDLER: Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
CHANDLER: Alright, hang on a second there Custer.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
CHANDLER: Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.
CHANDLER: Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
CHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
CHANDLER: You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Pecan sandy, just made em.
CHANDLER: What're these, raisins?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You were trying to eat it!
CHANDLER: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, 4.50. Ross, double latte, 2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25. So, all together that’s 12.75.
CHANDLER: This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi.
CHANDLER: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
CHANDLER: Who’s the father?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.
CHANDLER: OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey! Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman.
CHANDLER: ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nope. We took her to lunch.
CHANDLER: Your own brand of vigilante justice.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just.
CHANDLER: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
CHANDLER: To my best bud. Thanks best bud.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: How ya feelin'?
CHANDLER: Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
CHANDLER: You want me to wear your panties?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, he was talking about rules.
CHANDLER: Uh-huh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
CHANDLER: That, that's what's stupid.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Those are the pacts!
CHANDLER: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.
CHANDLER: Ahhhh-I’m not going to call you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I ran!
CHANDLER: Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
CHANDLER: FREE PORN!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really? They love him down on six.
CHANDLER: But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
CHANDLER: I think you played the Gunther card too soon.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash, my prices! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
CHANDLER: What a wank!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh? Why not?
CHANDLER: Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the CupertHewitt museum.
CHANDLER: Without me?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Bye.
CHANDLER: I'm still on London time, does that count?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Based on this play?. Based on this play!
CHANDLER: Hey, kids.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That doesn't sound like you. That's Monica talking!
CHANDLER: We made this decision together.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
CHANDLER: Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Done with the bookcase!
CHANDLER: All finished!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh!
CHANDLER: That’s great!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
CHANDLER: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats.
CHANDLER: Do you want a calculator?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!
CHANDLER: What the hell happened?! How were you locked in?! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: God, your hair sure is different!
CHANDLER: Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why do men keep talking to me like this?
CHANDLER: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What does she mean by HH?
CHANDLER: It means we're holding hands.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your.
CHANDLER: I'm, I'm okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You do?!
CHANDLER: Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
CHANDLER: You can tell us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: In case you’re wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names.
CHANDLER: Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: 007 has a fancy car!
CHANDLER: Batman has the Batmobile!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
CHANDLER: What did you do when they found out?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
CHANDLER: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah!
CHANDLER: You didn’t think I used to wear glasses right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe.
CHANDLER: AAAaaa-doption!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Alright.
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why?
CHANDLER: Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Whoa!
CHANDLER: And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No. I'mI'm to depressed to talk.
CHANDLER: I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just--y'know--stop it!
CHANDLER: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I gotta go check something over here. He walks.
CHANDLER: What a baby.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…
CHANDLER: You’re an actor!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you sure this time?
CHANDLER: Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
CHANDLER: No reason, except she told me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
CHANDLER: Dude, it's Chandler.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
CHANDLER: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: People are trying to sleep in here!
CHANDLER: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Kinda like your Barca lounger.
CHANDLER: Is that what you’re thinking about right now?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Do you wanna do it at the same time?
CHANDLER: Count of three?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out!
CHANDLER: From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
CHANDLER: Well this is just sad!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
CHANDLER: What gave me away?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh no! What’s the matter?
CHANDLER: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not Archie Comic funny.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, III've got to give my marriage another chance.
CHANDLER: No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
CHANDLER:! Because our guy smells incredible!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
CHANDLER: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
CHANDLER: It is starting to get dark out there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here.
CHANDLER: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey.
CHANDLER: Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This is harder than I thought it would be.
CHANDLER: Oh, it's gonna be okay.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, none for me. Thanks.
CHANDLER: Just a little bit of sugar.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
CHANDLER: The Hard Rock Café?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
CHANDLER: A little late for that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Did she just ask me out on a date?
CHANDLER: I don’t think so.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Oyster?
CHANDLER: If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know. That’s why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
CHANDLER: You’ll be fine. Hillary’s blind, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah? How'd it go?
CHANDLER: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song!
CHANDLER: In front of all this people?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I will not take this abuse.
CHANDLER: 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy.'</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
CHANDLER: Okay, but if you can't no dinner!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah, come here.
CHANDLER: Oh, that’s mature.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
CHANDLER: No, did he hug you?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah? When?
CHANDLER: When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
CHANDLER: Ya know, the man's got a point.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Shut up!
CHANDLER: Tell me what?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
CHANDLER: Oh, you know, I would but that might get in the way of my lying around time.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Got me.
CHANDLER: Can I get a beer.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
CHANDLER: You are way to young to have seen that!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nice, put it with the others.

CHANDLER: Oh, I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut I'm too.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Don't you want to look through the rest?
CHANDLER: I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It just seems so futile, you know? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, what did you have?
CHANDLER: It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is DCup. Okay, now much have you won so far?</s>

CHANDLER: Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No reason, I’m just saying that uh. That’s where I’ll be.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
CHANDLER: Not once did we do that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
CHANDLER: Sure, nice.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.

<s>NOTFRIEND: BEND OVER?!
CHANDLER: Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24 point!
CHANDLER: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.
CHANDLER: Ohhh-hoo, funny story!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Sorry, members only.
CHANDLER: I wanna quit the gym.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.
CHANDLER: They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t know! But it’s the same!
CHANDLER: You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The balloon?

<s>NOTFRIEND: Me neither, y'know what.
CHANDLER: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
CHANDLER: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
CHANDLER: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really?
CHANDLER: Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you have to return it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and and live forever as a machine.
CHANDLER: And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.</s>

CHANDLER: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I'm from California.
CHANDLER: Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's fine.
CHANDLER: Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. I'm growing.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: A donation has been made in your name to.
CHANDLER: Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
CHANDLER: Hey, big guy, game time.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What else did you think about?
CHANDLER: Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
CHANDLER: Like an eclipse.</s>

CHANDLER: We're just hanging out by the spoons.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
CHANDLER: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a, napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow.
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.
CHANDLER: But if you don’t come back soon, there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!
CHANDLER: I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
CHANDLER: Stop what?!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
CHANDLER: Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That would be a good idea.

CHANDLER: Too?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
CHANDLER: My husband is sleeping with his secretary. She's married!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just.

CHANDLER: Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?!
CHANDLER: Well, that's what we do. Y'know, II mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!

CHANDLER: Do I smell essential oils?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.

<s>NOTFRIEND: A couple of days.
CHANDLER: Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Hi!
CHANDLER: Uh, hey!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
CHANDLER: What problem did you tell him you had?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What, are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!
CHANDLER: Let me try it on!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend.
CHANDLER: Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
CHANDLER: Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
CHANDLER: I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, she's still napping.
CHANDLER: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
CHANDLER: Sounds like a date to me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: It's on! It's on!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: OK. Any of you guys want anything else?
CHANDLER: Could I have one of those.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow! If only more people knew.
CHANDLER: Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
CHANDLER: Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?</s>

CHANDLER: Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, if you think it will help.
CHANDLER: That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
CHANDLER: I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.</s>

CHANDLER: I know its tough now, but things will get better.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he he threw some faeces.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
CHANDLER: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Seriously? She actually said that?
CHANDLER: Am I crazy to be this upset?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why would you do that?

CHANDLER: Ill be right there.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
CHANDLER: I think I know what you mean though, the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs, oh, you already got that.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, the interview.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.

<s>NOTFRIEND: No. Did you?
CHANDLER: And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.</s>

CHANDLER: Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What do you think you learned how to do in the last two minutes?
CHANDLER: Maybe we finish this for him! Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had, aaand SEND!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.
CHANDLER: Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Wow that was a big one.
CHANDLER: I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Me neither! We have to get in!
CHANDLER: Just act like you belong.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Keep going.
CHANDLER: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
CHANDLER: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.</s>

CHANDLER: Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Really?
CHANDLER: I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Please, you're going down!
CHANDLER: You are going downer!</s>

CHANDLER: So, how did you enjoy the play?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Don’t come in here!
CHANDLER: Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I.
CHANDLER: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She's mine!

<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
CHANDLER: Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.</s>

CHANDLER: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling, okay?

CHANDLER: Feelings, such strong feelings.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?
CHANDLER: Sleeping with somebody new: anxiety, panic, and, I’m afraid, even more sweating.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What is your job?
CHANDLER: Staying out of the way.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
CHANDLER: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Not now, I’m sick!
CHANDLER: Oh come on you big faker!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Cool! I'll catch up!
CHANDLER: So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh honey.
CHANDLER: Let me just say something. Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke. I just want to say that I. And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You're kidding!
CHANDLER: You're kidding, no!</s>

CHANDLER: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right. I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I. It kills me that I can't give her a baby. I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife, she's already there. She's a mother, without a baby.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
CHANDLER: You win! You win! I can't have sex with ya!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I guess you're right.
CHANDLER: You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well it’s hard to tell. Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
CHANDLER: She’s just doing her job!</s>

CHANDLER: Answer the phone.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
CHANDLER: Yes, every single one of them.</s>

CHANDLER: Ew, ew, ew, ew ew!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I know. Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.

<s>NOTFRIEND: It's really not that big!
CHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
CHANDLER: Yes it would. What do you say to 50?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Of course, of course.
CHANDLER: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.
CHANDLER: Yeah, let’s just forget it.</s>

CHANDLER: All right, lets break this down. What exactly did he say to you?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
CHANDLER: Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?

CHANDLER: So what does this mean?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Try the bottom one.
CHANDLER: Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
CHANDLER: David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or. Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.</s>

CHANDLER: Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
CHANDLER: Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
CHANDLER: So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Call her! Call her now!
CHANDLER: Multiple, so many paper cuts.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Told ya.
CHANDLER: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ba dum bum chessh.
CHANDLER: Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.</s>

CHANDLER: Now stop bringing us pizzas you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ooh. II don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
CHANDLER: Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.</s>

CHANDLER: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
CHANDLER: Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy, uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist, as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah! Once.
CHANDLER: Well, what’d you do?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Ok worse case scenario is we borrow some money from my parents.
CHANDLER: We're not borrowing money.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I'm dead?
CHANDLER: And so young.</s>

CHANDLER: He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?
CHANDLER: Isn’t that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.

CHANDLER: So I got ya something.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Why would someone do that?! One might wonder.
CHANDLER: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Can I help you?
CHANDLER: Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.</s>

CHANDLER: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something, repellant, about me?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
CHANDLER: I can check that for ya.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Now, have you told anyone else?

CHANDLER: All right, then massage me up right nice!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: She’s leaving for three months.
CHANDLER: For camp!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
CHANDLER: And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Let’s go watch it at your place.
CHANDLER: Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
CHANDLER: How do you know so much about this?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
CHANDLER: Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it. Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R. G. put on it. Her initials.</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: You got a man who's a nanny? You got a manny?
CHANDLER: You know, I don't mind a, male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
CHANDLER: Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: You too.

CHANDLER: Oh, they said uh, You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It's a good play, isn't it?

<s>NOTFRIEND: I think so.
CHANDLER: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh yeah. See ya guys.
CHANDLER: Ridiculously dull Bobby.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
CHANDLER: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
CHANDLER: Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyre not in the baby buying business.</s>

CHANDLER: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Dude! How-how did you write this?
CHANDLER: I stole Monica’s and changed the name.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to MaryAngela.
CHANDLER: Okay, absolutely!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Nighty-nite.
CHANDLER: You're not a dad. You're not a dad.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: What?
CHANDLER: Well you see in Cups, once you get 700, you have to double it.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
CHANDLER: What is th, it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It’s spreading already.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
CHANDLER: I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too huge.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.
CHANDLER: Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
CHANDLER: Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well I’m sorry.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well actually, Ross doesn't.

<s>NOTFRIEND: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!
CHANDLER: How is that ever going to happen?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
CHANDLER: Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people… come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!
CHANDLER: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
CHANDLER: That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
CHANDLER: Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's my pie!
CHANDLER: Which smells delicious!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: See, now it’s weird again.
CHANDLER: I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.</s>

CHANDLER: No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
CHANDLER: They're really yours. We, found them in your old room.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
CHANDLER: Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
CHANDLER: What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Ohh!
CHANDLER: So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
CHANDLER: Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? II really need to talk to you.
CHANDLER: Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: That's what I said.
CHANDLER: Look, maybe we should go?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
CHANDLER: Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I know! That's why we got to find Monica! You know where she is?
CHANDLER: What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, I. I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
CHANDLER: Like you have a routine?</s>

<s>NOTFRIEND: Honey, listen. You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
CHANDLER: Is he funnier than me?</s>

CHANDLER: Two hours, that lasted!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: It's the foosball table.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know, finding gold.
CHANDLER: I think we're making too big a deal out of this. So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef, what can you make out of backing soda and beer?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
CHANDLER: A vending machine?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: It was unbelievable, I walked in there and she was all over me.

<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, are you going to be able to do this?
CHANDLER: Not well.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
CHANDLER: But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!</s>

CHANDLER: Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Did you see the size of the closets?!
CHANDLER: I can't believe we live here!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.

CHANDLER: Am not!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.

CHANDLER: For an emergency just like this.</s>

CHANDLER: Did I teach her that? Did I just, impart wisdom?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
CHANDLER: You just thought of that in there?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.
CHANDLER: I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more.

<s>NOTFRIEND: But you are a liar.

CHANDLER: So what are you going to do?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.
CHANDLER: That’s what you should say.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I was kidding.

CHANDLER: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay.
CHANDLER: You’re our age!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
CHANDLER: Can I be that guy?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?

<s>NOTFRIEND: It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
CHANDLER: It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: So far so good!
CHANDLER: Honey, I'm old!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands.
CHANDLER: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: No, you're right. We shouldn't do it like this. Huh. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, it's not the end of the world.
CHANDLER: You mean it?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Yeah.
CHANDLER: You think we're ready for something like that?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
CHANDLER: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case. Okay.
CHANDLER: You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Mm-hmm.
CHANDLER: How long it took to go back in the water?</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.</s>
<s>NOTFRIEND: Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is.
