<s>MONICA: You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.</s>
<s>MONICA: Fertilize me!</s>
<s>MONICA: What is wrong with you?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohh, absolutely.</s>
<s>MONICA: For that and so many other things I want to say thank you.</s>

<s>MONICA: I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's not a date, okay.</s>

<s>MONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.</s>

<s>MONICA: We'll be here for days.</s>
<s>MONICA: Cant you just let this go?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, there’s banana on it.</s>
<s>MONICA: When do we tell them about this?</s>
<s>MONICA: The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon.</s>
<s>MONICA: How did you get in there?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?</s>
<s>MONICA: In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.</s>

<s>MONICA: From homeroom!</s>
<s>MONICA: Why?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh hi!</s>
<s>MONICA: You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.</s>
<s>MONICA: The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.</s>
<s>MONICA: I don’t know.</s>
<s>MONICA: Delta Dawn.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.</s>
<s>MONICA: Who vomited on, y'know what, what you up to Joe?</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.</s>
<s>MONICA: See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.</s>
<s>MONICA: Don’t let her go without a fight!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God!</s>
<s>MONICA: So, did you two have fun?</s>

<s>MONICA: Shut up.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever!</s>
<s>MONICA: Its It is bigger than mine!</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler usually helps me with this, but hes really into the game so I dont want to bother him.</s>
<s>MONICA: Don't joke with me, okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my god good?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hello, people who do not live here.</s>
<s>MONICA: I think there was a little misunderstanding before.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't!</s>
<s>MONICA: How-how did that happen?</s>
<s>MONICA: well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.</s>
<s>MONICA: I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.</s>
<s>MONICA: Please.</s>
<s>MONICA: What do you say, 6:30, my place?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean that's allowed.</s>

<s>MONICA: Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.</s>
<s>MONICA: Child-birth, its a natural thing!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.</s>

<s>MONICA: How was that possible?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean how could you do this?</s>

<s>MONICA: Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding.</s>
<s>MONICA: I make your decisions and I say, I'm not fired!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!</s>
<s>MONICA: Think who you're dealing with here.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok, I dont wanna be negative so Ill say that most of the signs you bought are good.</s>

<s>MONICA: Give it to me.</s>
<s>MONICA: Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.</s>
<s>MONICA: Does seem pretty perfect.</s>
<s>MONICA: Everybody bang.</s>
<s>MONICA: Deep breathes everyone.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?</s>
<s>MONICA: So?</s>
<s>MONICA: I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's so sweet.</s>
<s>MONICA: I don't know.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, it did.</s>
<s>MONICA: If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.</s>

<s>MONICA: And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, that's nice!</s>
<s>MONICA: Boy, kids are mean when theyre hungry.</s>
<s>MONICA: And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.</s>
<s>MONICA: Who’s Mr. Garibaldi?</s>
<s>MONICA: Who the hell are you?!</s>
<s>MONICA: I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.</s>

<s>MONICA: Nice to meet you!</s>
<s>MONICA: You’re not getting dressed.</s>
<s>MONICA: Its true?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out.</s>
<s>MONICA: Just watch the hot woman get naked!</s>
<s>MONICA: You just told me that he hates marriage!</s>
<s>MONICA: What are we gonna do?</s>
<s>MONICA: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?</s>
<s>MONICA: Cut it out.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean this has been the most amazing week.</s>
<s>MONICA: But I remember people telling me about it.</s>

<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow, what?</s>
<s>MONICA: Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after.</s>
<s>MONICA: Really sexy.</s>

<s>MONICA: Phoebe, it’s okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!</s>
<s>MONICA: So, should I call him back?</s>
<s>MONICA: Erica, baby!</s>

<s>MONICA: I know… Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohh.</s>
<s>MONICA: It was Michelle.</s>
<s>MONICA: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh Joey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Toe the line.</s>
<s>MONICA: Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!</s>
<s>MONICA: I will prove it to you!</s>

<s>MONICA: Why would you do that?!</s>
<s>MONICA: You know what?</s>
<s>MONICA: Phil!</s>

<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Weird, weird.</s>

<s>MONICA: We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?</s>

<s>MONICA: Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.</s>
<s>MONICA: No that is not what happened with us.</s>
<s>MONICA: I don't think so.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat'?</s>
<s>MONICA: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go!</s>
<s>MONICA: No reason.</s>

<s>MONICA: I dont think Id care.</s>
<s>MONICA: Is there a problem?</s>
<s>MONICA: That was me and Ross.</s>
<s>MONICA: Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.</s>

<s>MONICA: Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the.</s>

<s>MONICA: Don't do this.</s>
<s>MONICA: Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?</s>
<s>MONICA: Welcome to the real world!</s>
<s>MONICA: Why?</s>
<s>MONICA: He doesn't have anyone.</s>
<s>MONICA: Not one that can pee on the roof.</s>
<s>MONICA: Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine.</s>
<s>MONICA: I can’t be fair.</s>
<s>MONICA: Nooo!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: This is so great!</s>
<s>MONICA: He doesnt even know what hes doing!</s>

<s>MONICA: That's your call.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yes.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, I get your point.</s>
<s>MONICA: This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.</s>
<s>MONICA: Nice!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: Are these the shoes?</s>
<s>MONICA: That's weird, it's empty!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh good God!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok, so that's what we're doing.</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?</s>

<s>MONICA: Somebody likes you!</s>
<s>MONICA: And?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.</s>
<s>MONICA: And that would be?</s>
<s>MONICA: It's 2101 and I am not amused.</s>
<s>MONICA: We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.</s>
<s>MONICA: Helloooo?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Which we are, and-and we already paid for it.</s>
<s>MONICA: We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, Id like a latte.</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?</s>
<s>MONICA: It doesn’t make any sense.</s>
<s>MONICA: And nowhere we arewith our future before usand I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend.</s>
<s>MONICA: What we did was wrong.</s>
<s>MONICA: Olive loaf?</s>
<s>MONICA: We're, we're.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s good to see you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.</s>
<s>MONICA: You called me fat.</s>
<s>MONICA: Not yet!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm Monica.</s>
<s>MONICA: Leon, Leon.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God, what were you doing in a library?</s>
<s>MONICA: Why?!</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, have you seen you?</s>
<s>MONICA: Weird.</s>
<s>MONICA: Now that youre here.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s not your birthday.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh yeah, I remember mine!</s>
<s>MONICA: You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!</s>
<s>MONICA: Isn't that sad?</s>
<s>MONICA: It wasn't your whole toe!</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.</s>
<s>MONICA: and head to Canada!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone!</s>
<s>MONICA: My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.</s>
<s>MONICA: Just going over my toast.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?</s>
<s>MONICA: GET OUT YOU DUFUS!</s>
<s>MONICA: Good, you’re home!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait, he's not here yet.</s>
<s>MONICA: Please.</s>
<s>MONICA: How many?</s>
<s>MONICA: Thank you so much for staying so calm during this.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s your suitcase.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.</s>
<s>MONICA: It is going to be okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.</s>
<s>MONICA: I am just one tiny person!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok ay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh.</s>
<s>MONICA: I am the energy train and you are on board.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh man!</s>
<s>MONICA: You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, in we go.</s>
<s>MONICA: God, this is so hard.</s>
<s>MONICA: Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.</s>
<s>MONICA: Thanks.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well it wasn't that many guys.</s>
<s>MONICA: What honey?</s>
<s>MONICA: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah you will!</s>
<s>MONICA: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.</s>
<s>MONICA: Want to feel good about yourself?</s>
<s>MONICA: Seems like it works to me.</s>
<s>MONICA: I was probably waiting for it to open.</s>
<s>MONICA: Let’s get the show on it!</s>
<s>MONICA: I know.</s>
<s>MONICA: Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?</s>
<s>MONICA: Mmm-mmm.</s>
<s>MONICA: I’m pretty feisty!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: So tell me something, Mom.</s>
<s>MONICA: Uh, ah.</s>
<s>MONICA: No-no, wait!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?!</s>
<s>MONICA: I know, I just thought it would be fun.</s>
<s>MONICA: What is it?</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler’s my husband.</s>
<s>MONICA: What i-, what is she like.</s>
<s>MONICA: I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but.</s>
<s>MONICA: You're sick, you shouldn't play.</s>
<s>MONICA: To solidify your commitment!</s>
<s>MONICA: From work.</s>
<s>MONICA: Licorice?</s>
<s>MONICA: You would look good in that.</s>
<s>MONICA: Aww, honey I’m sorry.</s>
<s>MONICA: So, you think youre going to talk to him?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, good.</s>
<s>MONICA: Please!</s>
<s>MONICA: Fine!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross?</s>
<s>MONICA: A lot of major actors do nude scenes!</s>
<s>MONICA: It will be my pleasure.</s>
<s>MONICA: Is that why he's acting so weird?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?</s>
<s>MONICA: That massage felt so good!</s>
<s>MONICA: Not it.</s>
<s>MONICA: That’s right.</s>
<s>MONICA: This totally makes sense!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, how did the audition go?</s>
<s>MONICA: That's my last batch.</s>
<s>MONICA: I see pizza!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well Im getting my revenge!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait a minute!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, I thought it was cute.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh!</s>
<s>MONICA: She's only a couple of months pregnant.</s>
<s>MONICA: Huh, wanna bet?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, you wanna see something?</s>
<s>MONICA: No!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hi.</s>
<s>MONICA: Of course!</s>
<s>MONICA: Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!</s>
<s>MONICA: Something we can eat, with our hands.</s>
<s>MONICA: So have you called her yet?</s>
<s>MONICA: He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!</s>
<s>MONICA: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.</s>
<s>MONICA: Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.</s>
<s>MONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.</s>
<s>MONICA: You kissed him?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, about that.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ahhh!</s>
<s>MONICA: If you guys don't want it to be special, fine.</s>
<s>MONICA: Nothing will be yours!</s>
<s>MONICA: You didn’t dress up either?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?</s>
<s>MONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.</s>
<s>MONICA: You only think its stupid because you suck at it.</s>
<s>MONICA: This is harder than I thought it would be.</s>
<s>MONICA: You didn't hear the speech!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah.</s>
<s>MONICA: Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is.</s>
<s>MONICA: Level 1 alert.</s>
<s>MONICA: Are you okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.</s>
<s>MONICA: You bought a boat?</s>
<s>MONICA: Maybe they're napping.</s>
<s>MONICA: What do you mean?</s>
<s>MONICA: That thing can put someone’s eye out!</s>
<s>MONICA: I get it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, Larry.</s>
<s>MONICA: And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!</s>
<s>MONICA: Really?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.</s>
<s>MONICA: How'd the audition go?!</s>
<s>MONICA: I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.</s>
<s>MONICA: This is crazy!</s>
<s>MONICA: So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?</s>
<s>MONICA: Don’t worry about it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Now you have to prove your love!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.</s>
<s>MONICA: So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?</s>
<s>MONICA: That's right baby!</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, you do seem a little tense.</s>
<s>MONICA: Rachel?!</s>
<s>MONICA: What are you talking about?</s>
<s>MONICA: I want you to meet someone really special.</s>
<s>MONICA: Erica, are you okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: How could we have let this happen?</s>
<s>MONICA: Is it too soon to call?</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hmm, care to make it interesting?</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!</s>
<s>MONICA: You're so efficient.</s>
<s>MONICA: Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, this is the one.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh myThis is so embarrassing.</s>
<s>MONICA: Why?</s>
<s>MONICA: I want a marriage.</s>
<s>MONICA: I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.</s>
<s>MONICA: I blame London.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.</s>
<s>MONICA: So-so I went down to city hall and got these.</s>
<s>MONICA: Go!</s>
<s>MONICA: Rachel!</s>
<s>MONICA: We could not have been nicer to her!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, I’d like to but, I’m not sure we have time to go.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's.</s>
<s>MONICA: Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off -each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!</s>
<s>MONICA: Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.</s>
<s>MONICA: Believe me, nothing about this is fair!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh good-good you’re here!</s>
<s>MONICA: Let’s do something crazy!</s>
<s>MONICA: You, you always wanted me too.</s>
<s>MONICA: They don’t know that I’ve come home yet.</s>
<s>MONICA: I know what you need, you need a bodyguard.</s>
<s>MONICA: Umm.</s>
<s>MONICA: I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.</s>
<s>MONICA: Never done that before.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait-wait-wait!</s>
<s>MONICA: III’m, I’m just here to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.</s>
<s>MONICA: What if I turn out the lights?</s>
<s>MONICA: But I'mI'm done now.</s>
<s>MONICA: And in the world!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, this is incredible!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay fine, now Ross.</s>
<s>MONICA: Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest.</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Did not.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap.</s>
<s>MONICA: You know that.</s>
<s>MONICA: Not it!</s>
<s>MONICA: All right.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohhh!</s>
<s>MONICA: I need to borrow a hundred bucks.</s>

<s>MONICA: Thats much better.</s>
<s>MONICA: You can spill.</s>

<s>MONICA: As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.</s>
<s>MONICA: Its the perfect crime!</s>
<s>MONICA: You sold me out.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh wait I forgot my wrap.</s>
<s>MONICA: Let’s try umm, try looking sexy.</s>
<s>MONICA: No, no, not a party.</s>
<s>MONICA: I am, aren’t I?</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey!</s>

<s>MONICA: Wow Joey, this is, uhh.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.</s>
<s>MONICA: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing.</s>
<s>MONICA: No, it’s more like a good luck.</s>
<s>MONICA: Y'know what?</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Isn’t that mine?</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah but I’m not keeping it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.</s>
<s>MONICA: Thank you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Who's that?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy.</s>
<s>MONICA: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?</s>

<s>MONICA: Really.</s>
<s>MONICA: Excuse me?</s>
<s>MONICA: Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?</s>

<s>MONICA: And covered in marinara sauce!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yes!</s>
<s>MONICA: I can not see him?</s>

<s>MONICA: Christmas cookie?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay!</s>

<s>MONICA: I’m Monica Gellar.</s>
<s>MONICA: This gotta be so hard.</s>

<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here.</s>
<s>MONICA: We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!</s>
<s>MONICA: It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.</s>
<s>MONICA: Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Did you just smell my hair?</s>
<s>MONICA: Let me try.</s>

<s>MONICA: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are.</s>
<s>MONICA: Thank God!</s>
<s>MONICA: But come on, it doesn’t matter.</s>
<s>MONICA: Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohhh.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey.</s>
<s>MONICA: I thought I lost it.</s>

<s>MONICA: That’s a good idea!</s>
<s>MONICA: But, I dont want you to lose Joey over it.</s>
<s>MONICA: How about receiving?</s>
<s>MONICA: Are you sure?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.</s>

<s>MONICA: I'll get it!</s>
<s>MONICA: No, II havent seen your pink shirt.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: I know!</s>
<s>MONICA: I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos.</s>
<s>MONICA: Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?</s>
<s>MONICA: It-it'll be way too complicated.</s>
<s>MONICA: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.</s>
<s>MONICA: You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler, this actually bothers you?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!</s>

<s>MONICA: Chandler!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well itsI mean Id justId be self-conscious.</s>

<s>MONICA: I'll work on the lumps.</s>
<s>MONICA: Take off your robe!</s>
<s>MONICA: You cleaned!</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey, do you know we can see you from here?</s>
<s>MONICA: Monica.</s>

<s>MONICA: You got the job?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey let me ask you a question.</s>

<s>MONICA: They’re still very angry!</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean look how cute she is.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's Pete.</s>

<s>MONICA: Um-hmm.</s>
<s>MONICA: His indian name?</s>
<s>MONICA: We'll probably be the first ones there.</s>
<s>MONICA: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.</s>
<s>MONICA: You disappeared after dinner.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, bye for me too.</s>
<s>MONICA: She'll say No, David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.</s>
<s>MONICA: If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm glad you smashed her watch!</s>
<s>MONICA: Buy sell, high low, bears bulls.</s>
<s>MONICA: Why don't you just call her?</s>
<s>MONICA: How do you feel?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, right, right.</s>

<s>MONICA: That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz.</s>
<s>MONICA: You are just the sweetest.</s>
<s>MONICA: Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.</s>
<s>MONICA: I heard it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.</s>
<s>MONICA: I just wanted something stupid and meaningless.</s>
<s>MONICA: And you're cute too.</s>
<s>MONICA: And that would be a shut-down!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.</s>

<s>MONICA: That's fine.</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised.</s>
<s>MONICA: Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?</s>
<s>MONICA: Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry.</s>
<s>MONICA: How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, so what do you say?</s>

<s>MONICA: Lets open it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure.</s>
<s>MONICA: So do them for free.</s>
<s>MONICA: This is unbelievable.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?</s>
<s>MONICA: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross, it's Nana.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big, ot.</s>
<s>MONICA: What is going on here?</s>
<s>MONICA: You painting his toenails?</s>
<s>MONICA: God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.</s>
<s>MONICA: You bet!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, I’ll rest.</s>
<s>MONICA: Does anybody have a problem with that?</s>
<s>MONICA: Woo!</s>
<s>MONICA: We are playing for women everywhere.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.</s>

<s>MONICA: I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yes!</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say.</s>
<s>MONICA: What is she talking about?</s>
<s>MONICA: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!</s>
<s>MONICA: Chicken Kiev?</s>
<s>MONICA: Other people just wreck stuff.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God!</s>
<s>MONICA: Im on my way to have my ears cut off.</s>
<s>MONICA: Where’re you goin’?</s>
<s>MONICA: That is excellent.</s>
<s>MONICA: I know!</s>
<s>MONICA: He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.</s>
<s>MONICA: The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?</s>
<s>MONICA: Really?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Look!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?!</s>
<s>MONICA: They are writing up the paper right now.</s>

<s>MONICA: You wanna push the caps until you hear them click.</s>
<s>MONICA: Are you going in there for?</s>
<s>MONICA: Got it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Chasing him all around the room?</s>

<s>MONICA: Yes I am!</s>
<s>MONICA: What's up bro?</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait, now so you joined the gym?</s>

<s>MONICA: Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.</s>
<s>MONICA: What do you mean what do we do?</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey, you have to change before the party.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah and-and I’m sorry too.</s>
<s>MONICA: I hate Ross!</s>
<s>MONICA: I never get my messages.</s>

<s>MONICA: What's up?</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.</s>

<s>MONICA: Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.</s>
<s>MONICA: So what do you think?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.</s>

<s>MONICA: Hey.</s>
<s>MONICA: I’m sorry!</s>
<s>MONICA: Where is everybody?</s>
<s>MONICA: But we love our house.</s>
<s>MONICA: You know what, I mean all these years I thought you were on my side, but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad, so they'd keep liking you better.</s>
<s>MONICA: God, Ross is on a date with your sister!</s>
<s>MONICA: My turn?</s>
<s>MONICA: I will!</s>
<s>MONICA: No I told you I can't.</s>

<s>MONICA: Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.</s>
<s>MONICA: I think you're my favorite.</s>
<s>MONICA: Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.</s>
<s>MONICA: Noo!</s>
<s>MONICA: And-and-and what-what's this?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, I can't break up with him, I'm the one who made him quit drinking.</s>

<s>MONICA: Oh my God!</s>
<s>MONICA: You were just being so nice to him!</s>

<s>MONICA: Hi Chandler.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hi, its Monica Geller.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?</s>
<s>MONICA: Nancy doesn’t smoke!</s>
<s>MONICA: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's like Rachel in High School.</s>
<s>MONICA: Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then!</s>
<s>MONICA: I just had it for one night.</s>
<s>MONICA: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.</s>
<s>MONICA: Guys, rules are good!</s>
<s>MONICA: Show up at her doorstep!</s>

<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: You be okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God!</s>
<s>MONICA: I can't ask you to give that up.</s>
<s>MONICA: Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him.</s>

<s>MONICA: Oh, put him on!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, right.</s>
<s>MONICA: Don’t be a baby!</s>
<s>MONICA: Two girls and a boy?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, this is twisted!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp.</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean I could live in this thing!</s>

<s>MONICA: What were you thinking?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, really?!</s>
<s>MONICA: So you're free Thursday, then.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, Rache.</s>
<s>MONICA: No one knows!</s>
<s>MONICA: There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.</s>
<s>MONICA: Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.</s>
<s>MONICA: My family and my friends… I really like to say that I’m-um… Y’know what I’d really like to say?</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, I do.</s>
<s>MONICA: He's just some guy I work with!</s>

<s>MONICA: Anybody lose this?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ah, it's an honest mistake.</s>
<s>MONICA: Like I have nothing better to do!</s>
<s>MONICA: I had to go with the odds Rach.</s>
<s>MONICA: I am not.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well II really dont remember the name of it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.</s>
<s>MONICA: We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: When you hear it, come running.</s>
<s>MONICA: II keep private things in there.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right!</s>
<s>MONICA: We’re gonna have fun.</s>
<s>MONICA: And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!</s>
<s>MONICA: But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called pigs in Ross.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait a minute!</s>
<s>MONICA: I can’t believe it!</s>
<s>MONICA: It-it doesnt bother you?</s>
<s>MONICA: We owe you?!</s>
<s>MONICA: He probably thought this was funny he’ll be telling this story for years!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh no no no no, this is dangerous territory.</s>
<s>MONICA: I can help you with this.</s>
<s>MONICA: Come on, it's second down.</s>
<s>MONICA: Eighth street deli?</s>
<s>MONICA: No, of course not.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm sorry?</s>
<s>MONICA: We're all sorry.</s>

<s>MONICA: Let's bring it in.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s kind of an important one!</s>
<s>MONICA: Do you know what’s a bad idea?</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow!</s>

<s>MONICA: Oh, it's so unfair!</s>
<s>MONICA: I feel terrible!</s>
<s>MONICA: Not yet!</s>
<s>MONICA: Just go get some!</s>
<s>MONICA: Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.</s>
<s>MONICA: Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Your a poet and don't know it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Thank you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Rachel, what's going on?</s>
<s>MONICA: I said Im next!</s>

<s>MONICA: I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, umm, okay, umm.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?</s>
<s>MONICA: What?!</s>
<s>MONICA: No, no its going to be great.</s>
<s>MONICA: There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.</s>
<s>MONICA: You dated her!</s>
<s>MONICA: A monkey could have made 'em!</s>
<s>MONICA: Someone musta stolen my credit card.</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, we’re getting married, married not sixth grade married.</s>

<s>MONICA: I don’t want a ghost.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm not going to be a part of this!</s>

<s>MONICA: Why don't I show you the baby's room?</s>
<s>MONICA: I am just there for jury duty.</s>
<s>MONICA: That's all.</s>

<s>MONICA: My God!</s>
<s>MONICA: Do me a favor and pass this to my parents.</s>

<s>MONICA: So, if you could just realize it on your own.</s>
<s>MONICA: Really?</s>

<s>MONICA: Maybe a piggy-back ride?</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.</s>
<s>MONICA: There he is, feeding stuffing to a dog!</s>
<s>MONICA: So I made snacks.</s>
<s>MONICA: I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!</s>
<s>MONICA: Your favorite!</s>
<s>MONICA: Where would we return it?</s>
<s>MONICA: A-ha!</s>
<s>MONICA: Clogs.</s>
<s>MONICA: What are you doing here?!</s>
