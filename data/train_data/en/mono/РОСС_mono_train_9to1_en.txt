<s>ROSS: Hey!</s>
<s>ROSS: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus.</s>
<s>ROSS: Okay lets put aside that you accidentally picked up my grandmothers ring and you accidentally proposed to Rachel.</s>
<s>ROSS: Eh.actually no, I don't need to because your little Ross is dead joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses.</s>

<s>ROSS: Long story, honey.</s>
<s>ROSS: ImIm sure thats not true.</s>
<s>ROSS: Okay, but just the jacket.</s>
<s>ROSS: It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.</s>
