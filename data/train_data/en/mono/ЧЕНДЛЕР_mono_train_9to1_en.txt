<s>CHANDLER: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And uh maybe you have to get used to it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Alright, we're gettin' closer.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's not gone!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I am so, so sorry.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Mother of God, I turned.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You're not, gone?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Thanks for making me do this.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Daahh!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Really?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, you didn't get me!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We must focus.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How about Joey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You’re the sweetest!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If-if you're not MaryAngela, then-then who is?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: For three years?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I think you should go back with Gary.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Really?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because she's not eleven!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh my god!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey just called.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Chandler.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I m trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Good-acre!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Isn't this amazing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You'll see how close it is to the city.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Do it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We have a crying child!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: She was kidding.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama… I’d better go pack.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You or me?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is everybody getting married?!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joe?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ross Geller's lunch.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: One of life's great, unanswerable questions.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You see what I mean.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You can not ever see him again!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ah, the I'm sorry I rejected you phone call.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I think I can come up with something better than that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Could be fricken.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Let's do it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh my God.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That’s still yours.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I cant believe tomorrows the big day.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We need the stuff.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And where the hell is all of our stuff?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I was in the car with Nancy all day.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, okay, you got it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Girl-on-girl porn?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes and I was saying the actual words.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, mister tux!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You can't make this stuff up!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I just meant hypothetically.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: See now it feels like Christmas!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I would like to see that ring please.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: One marriage please!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Ahhhh, you're not MaryAngela.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Nope!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Okay, I accept that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Dude, you're shaking!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Phoebe and Rachel!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How often does that happen?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Will you marry me?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Can I talk to you for a sec?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Wow that’s actually pretty cool.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I’m not sure I’m ready for that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, how'd the interview go?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ohh.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Monica’s a little drunk.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: My God!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The high road.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I don't know.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It was like torture!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But I just wa.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Raymond Chandler.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Huh?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You, me, Saturday night?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right, ready?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: During this timeare you, are you still my best man?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I love her!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It was this perfect evening, more or less.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, hold on.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Spackel boy!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm out five big ones!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, but its not who I am.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Go take the test and see if we're okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can see why that’s hard to resist.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You made pottery?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Uh, what was that?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Would you come on!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why again?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You could get caught between the moon and New York City.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How’d it go?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Really!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Glass, sand, whatever.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Had the money in the wrong hand.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So, is she gonna take the test?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Carol, Carol?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I got a job in advertising.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Freedom!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Nice to meet you!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Here I am.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: See, this is the brilliance of the show.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The yarns that you weave!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So it would just be for tonight, right?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You always forget at least one, or in some cases, fourteen.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ew.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That wasn't about being picky.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ooh.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And the world will never know.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's pee-pee.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Wh-why do you have to return it?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh yeah, that’s very nice.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, fine, 300.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Three big fat cartons in two days.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm your uncle Chandler funny is all I have!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Here you go.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You can’t wear that!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Its different.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Really?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ugly ring!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Bye bye.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: It must be a virus.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh my God!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Will you promise me something?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I can't.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I dont know what thats like?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's why for an entire year people called me Sir LimpsALot?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Did somebody miss me?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I dont know, five hundred dollars?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's a real conference.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I had to!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: She had a point.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I’m gonna get the ring!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ahhhh-gaaaahhh.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The one that doesn't.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh fresh air!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: II think I know who the other guy is.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Varrroom.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why must we dial so speedily anyway?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Uh, yeah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I swear!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: My chair.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And I’m the happiest guy in the world!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: RACHEL: Chandler honey, I'm sorry.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You come here to me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's throwing and catching!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: In fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And I love the milk!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What're you kidding?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Get out!'</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I promised I'd be with Monica.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh God, I thought.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Emma, how old are you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How do you feel about the, I really did forgot the present, please forgive me not fake out?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: EVERYTHNG'S FINE!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Are you sure?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look at this.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What is the matter with you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm coming home.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Bringing you closer to people who have phones.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Tell her you’re not ready.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Not bad.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Totally.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, it’s not a check.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How, exactly are you pursuing that?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: To Ross!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Damn.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can’t wait to read your book Ross!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Did she call?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Sure, what’s up?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey Pheebs!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, come here.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So that people would like you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Honey, you did call him back.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: The pants are a little tight.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What are you doing.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh my God!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ten buck!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: OK. OK.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I got that!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, that's not true.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh man!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey can't know that I'm here.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Dinah?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What’s it about?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can explain.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Its a lot more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Want a hint?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Not that big a deal?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Bored and bored!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because it’s flattering!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I wanna go to babe.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I can't believe I didn't even think of that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ahh!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh good.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Oh, yay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: My diary, that's brilliant.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Emotional Knapsack?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This is what I want to do.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah-get out!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No way!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's not true.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can see the headline now: Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and, generosity of spirit.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I’ll be in the closet.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But this is eleven.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Y'know what?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I have, and I remember this part vividly, a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean, you have needs.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hello?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm sorry!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to each other.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Isn't this a woman's hat?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I've said too much!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh yes.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Id like a Google Card.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right look, I think it s time for you to settle down.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You’re coming on to the entire room!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because I'm in love with Monica!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This is bad!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What are you doing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Im not!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What does it look like I'm doing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Wow.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What's the movie about?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Then how come no one here is wearing them?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I am mad!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You're not supposed to take that.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And look everybody knows it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Eh, forget about the future and stuff!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Heres another planNo!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: They yell.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Phoebe is going to say yes?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That is so not true.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh it’s Bing, sir.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: See ya.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Ah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, this does butch it up a bit.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm coming already!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Flying a jet?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Can we read it?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Not a thing.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Wait!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No I didn't!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And you accept!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You opened all the presents without me?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok. Yeah, but what if it's not?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean, why?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's just that, well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There's got to be a better explanation.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Pierce Brosnan?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in gym.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Come in!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean, is that ridiculous?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: From now on, this chair is the one!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I, have it to spare.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Monica, it's Sunday morning.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Well, you're welcome!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I wanna talk to him!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Aren't you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I see you've had a very productive day.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And last but not least.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey Joe!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ho!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Let's go.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You're building a post office?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Man to uh, me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Right there!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Damn you Oprah!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: You don’t have it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: They passed.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why two?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ahh, you know what?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is she good looking?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No more stupid wedding stuff?!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I do that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh yeah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Someone comment on the pants!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s cream-colored and tight I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well this is great.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Excuse me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Actually, it pays nothing.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Dangerous Liaisons.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's not the way to convince you.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I've just thought of a fourth.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: For your information, I was staring at her baby.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, so what does that mean?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Okay, see?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So are wefriends again?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Funny: ha-ha or funny: What size shoes do you wear?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, there you go.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But if you don’t come back soon, there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You must smell a lot of the time too.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And that's something they should learn on their own!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: The cameras?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You hear that?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a doctor!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, look at this!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Cry?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I dont race cars!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You said that?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You're nervous?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, it would be you!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s possible.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Are you seeing anybody right now?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is that your new walk?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You’re doing great.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh the humanity.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Would Monica let me wear this?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey Pheebs, whats up?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Cheese.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s not charity, Joe.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What is the point of having them if we never use them?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What's this?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right I'll have one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, well, then, II have to go to the bathroom.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I don't know anything about disciplining a child.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Then I’ll just bring them both over.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Scarring?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ernie.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I get pedicures!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, gorgeous.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, that's not the worst part.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You move in with her right now!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Gary's such a great guy!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Could I borrow it?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And she'll go, No-no-no, it's Chandler.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, a quick one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Sounds good to me, but what would a guy think?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We re doomed.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Big dog?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, y'know your not though.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What time is it?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, great.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes that was mine.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is that a real thing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This is James Bond’s tux?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We’re not eloping.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s so hard!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I could probably say 'Let's move in together.'</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's almost rude, that I'm not.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, we're standing out ground apparently.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah you are!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, five.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I was so careful!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What're we gonna do?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There are seven?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We did lie.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Are you funny?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to, bring the sperm.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Fine!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Monica!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can't believe she cracked your code!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I say you show this guy what you're made of.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No-no-no.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Uhh, 9.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well yknow, things are different.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Y’know what?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: At least let me finish this last one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What is the matter with you people?!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Well, Joey’s my best friend.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No way!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Pudo haber sido el General Tso.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Alright.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Peter Parker.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: No no!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Right across the street?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Not touching can't get mad!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's right!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Hey!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What do you want from me, I've never met the guy.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: III think you should talk to Monica now.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Off?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Heres a question you never have to ask.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We don’t.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Woah, woah, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part or, uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: He’s right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ross, don’t.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It was going great.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And I think Ross is generous too.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's huge.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, no the gravel capades.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And, plus, here they'd have their own room.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: See what I mean.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Do you realize you get louder each week?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The sunll come outtomorrow!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Do it now!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, it was me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There’s no back to this couch!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh what’s the matter?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Remember?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: II believe I'm, yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You went home with the waitress.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: 'Cause I was sitting there.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So, what was with all the whispering?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Or what my Father called Thursday night.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Fine with me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me go there!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We're just sitting here.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s everything we’ve been looking for.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Does South Oregon have a sports-team?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Really?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That’s great!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Go home!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know, I cannot believe we are even having this discussion.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why won’t you here me?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because I already bought my ticket.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I thought that was for the actual wedding.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joe.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey you broke my chair!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Apparently, they're called kicks or skids and I think I heard somebody say slorps.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So, where's Mike?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Phoebe.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It’s terrible!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Orange juice.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Are you aware that you're still talking?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, hello!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hi sweetie.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Whoa-whoa-whoa!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh great, food with hair on it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look down, look down, look down.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: American Express?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh yeah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh nothing, we’re just talking.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's just football.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Goodnight.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Pants.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I was not and oh God, shh!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, the dilating.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Thank you!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Can I see the book?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I need a walk.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Fine!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, it's just interesting.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Uh, if you say so sir.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ooh, Lambchop.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I'm 29 years old, damnit!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yknow what the worse part was?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What the hell happened?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If the car that backfired had run over you!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Will you excuse me I have to um.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I don't hate her, I love her.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: And I know he only knows the bad words.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: But after chapter 16: fat, single and ready to mingle, I was uplifted.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, did you see that?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh my God I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre, is it a vestibule?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I faked it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ok, you can have it.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: I mean, oh, forget it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What, what are you laughing at?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: That’s what you should say.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I think we've found our sperm!</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, hey guys!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Alright!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What did you mean by that?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I didn't think you'd understand.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, III'm done with this.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, nono, don't don't worry about it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh, would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You wanna see if we still have it?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Beer’s still cold.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Thats funny, this conversations how I got the bullet hole in my head.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: They don't serve donuts.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, Chandler will be there for you too.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Bye, momi-moo.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What happened?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We’re not gonna do that, y’know why?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Uh, HELLO!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Fine.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Together.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Come on, I, I'll show you to my room.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Gum would be perfection, GUM would be perfection, coulda said gum would be nice, could of said I ll have a stick, but no no no no for me, GUM is PERFECTION!'.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Have you seen Joey's bat?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I am so excited, I may vomit!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean she's not gonna leave me?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Did I just say if I were a guy?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Seriously, good luck marrying me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm sorry I won't be here.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding… How can I not be upset?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Don't say that I don't have goals!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ah, finally an explanation.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There has got to be a way!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Sure!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Tomorrow night is good.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So are you enjoying the bike?</s>

<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right, what have we learned so far?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: A place where no one will ever get out alive?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So how're you doing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: 'I'll hold you close in my arms.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont micro-manage.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Single are ya?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I just had to get a picture of this.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We used them as pillows when we went camping.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Whoa.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Who’s number two?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I let him win.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The big game is about to start!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Who’s he huggin’?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Come on Monica!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, come with us.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Sorry about the table, man.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And I think it would bother a lot of people.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, I'm there too!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Alright, he was looking for his bus money.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Gives Joey a.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Where you going, Joe?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Totally, and you?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I was making a coconut phone with the professor.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You want me to wear your panties?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right, rock on.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What are you singing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, what if all my stuff was here?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I’m gonna get the ring!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Not one single thing!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Worm medicine for the duck.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Im so glad you're here.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There he is!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hmm.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That thing, it's a uhh, yeah it's, it's a little flashy.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why can t you tell her?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, but this is the last time.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ross, what're you, what're you, what are you doing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Whats the matter?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: USO?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: He took my joke, he took it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I just have to know, okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called leihalalokos.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This is going to be fun.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Right, right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I was very drunk and I was somebody else's subconscious.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Are you insane?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I didn't know that.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's top notch.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Nngghhh!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Jill says vestibule, I m going with vestibule.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, come here.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You tricked me to get me into bed?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh man, I would have slept with him!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by, uh-.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We're worried about you.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Hey.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, bye!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What are you doing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How do Monica and Phoebe know?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Good-bye.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ground control to Major Tom!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There she is.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Pretty good!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Why not?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look, we're not just messing around!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, man.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Give it to me.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after ASS it is a bit of a challenge.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There you are!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All my energy is going into not asking that question.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, give me a second!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, she's goin' somewhere.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And this from the cry-for-help department.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What is this for?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ah.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well there you have it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, great.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: He just lopped it right off.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We’re going to dinner tonight.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look I, I can't.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So in the words of A.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And Doug wants us to play tennis with them.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Here we go.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I said, Like what?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I didn't mean now.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's a girl?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Again true.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But nothing has.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: New haircut?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What is important is while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay, but there is a big difference.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, no no no no.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Awful play, man.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I would never lie to get someone into bed.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey, can I talk to you for a second?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: All right buddy, time to roll over.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You are a lot hotter than I am.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: This girl thing is dangerous.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: To Put the Camera Away!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Again, what?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Because its awesome.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: From now on, I have no first name.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Pheebs?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can’t get myself right out of them!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I survived college with him!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I can't, I can't.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Expect it in 4-6 weeks.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh, what’s at 8:00?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, we only went out once.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Y’know?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No thank you!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Did you not understand the story?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Or we could keep doing this.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's a racecar.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm going to end it with her before it starts.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You feel complete.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Did she see us yet?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: It's all glued together.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Joey, it's been three days, okay.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Come on!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You wanna talk about people's feelings?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Ok. Ok, thank you.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: She went like this!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No one supposed to know about us!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh yes!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Aaaaand, hernia.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because she never calls me!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I don't see it that way.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Just consider us.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Robert's coming out.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You got waaaay too much free time.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well that’s a full cup!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Clearly you're having sex with him.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Really?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Oh-oh, what are you doing?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Her initials.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab, hop in.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: your ass?!?!?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: How?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Who the hell is Carl?!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And now we're back.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Wow!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: But, ehm, my bosses didn't go for it.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: You can tell us.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Well then why can’t I see it?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Okay!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Necklace?</s>
<s>CHANDLER: And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: There's not gonna be a next time!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.</s>
<s>CHANDLER: Forget it!</s>
<s>CHANDLER: What?</s>
