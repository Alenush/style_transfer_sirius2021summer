<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm Liza Minelli.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, its not your fault.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look amazing.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you didn't get me!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We must focus.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about Joey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re the sweetest!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If-if you're not MaryAngela, then-then who is?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: For three years?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think you should go back with Gary.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because she's not eleven!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have a crying child!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was kidding.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross Geller's lunch.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: One of life's great, unanswerable questions.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You see what I mean.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can not ever see him again!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, the I'm sorry I rejected you phone call.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think I can come up with something better than that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could be fricken.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let's do it!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And where the hell is all of our stuff?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I accept that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude, you're shaking!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe and Rachel!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How often does that happen?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will you marry me?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I talk to you for a sec?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow that’s actually pretty cool.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not sure I’m ready for that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, how'd the interview go?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica’s a little drunk.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: My God!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The high road.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was like torture!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Go take the test and see if we're okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can see why that’s hard to resist.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You made pottery?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why again?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You could get caught between the moon and New York City.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How’d it go?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Glass, sand, whatever.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here I am.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, this is the brilliance of the show.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The yarns that you weave!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So it would just be for tonight, right?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You always forget at least one, or in some cases, fourteen.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ew.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That wasn't about being picky.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the world will never know.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's pee-pee.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm your uncle Chandler funny is all I have!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here you go.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can’t wear that!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its different.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ugly ring!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It must be a virus.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will you promise me something?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's throwing and catching!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: In fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I love the milk!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What're you kidding?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get out!'</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I promised I'd be with Monica.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God, I thought.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How, exactly are you pursuing that?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: To Ross!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The pants are a little tight.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ten buck!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK. OK.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got that!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's not true.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh man!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey can't know that I'm here.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dinah?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s it about?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can explain.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kathy!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here goes.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean there's more than one of us.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Quick!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, you have to stay!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Want a hint?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not that big a deal?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bored and bored!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it’s flattering!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Totally.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, this is Rachel.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hang up, hang up.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: My name is Chandler.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it's great.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, I'm a very bad person.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is going on?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I wanna go to babe.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get up.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm smoking, I'm smoking.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what's weird?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: They were very nice boobies.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you finished with him?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What we want honey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why can't we savor the precious moments?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I. I am brave!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: One nation, under God.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, aren't we Mr.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, the tears are real.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: She picked those out too.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course it's the shovel-killer.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the, blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd btyds.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, this is actually good because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like a gang or something?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joke!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didnt know you read tea leaves.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe I didn't even think of that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're right, I know.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Two!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have fun at church-camp!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice is gonna go away now.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yay!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: My diary, that's brilliant.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Emotional Knapsack?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is what I want to do.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah-get out!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No way!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not true.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, then, eat me, I'm done.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and, generosity of spirit.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll be in the closet.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But this is eleven.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have, and I remember this part vividly, a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, tell me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, can you help me with the door?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What can't you do?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Perfect decibel.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, you have needs.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to each other.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really stupid.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Flashdance.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That would be so awkward!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that puts me in a difficult position.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Isn't this a woman's hat?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've said too much!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Id like a Google Card.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, I think it s time for you to settle down.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re coming on to the entire room!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I'm in love with Monica!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is bad!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im not!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does it look like I'm doing?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's the movie about?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then how come no one here is wearing them?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am mad!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not supposed to take that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And where the hell is all of our stuff?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Obviously!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: A big screen tv?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats a good idea.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then Joey remembered something.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are really frightening me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But, let's go win the lottery.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I, I looked at her.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you know that!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: II can’t believe Jill’s gone.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Flying a jet?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can we read it?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Funny: ha-ha or funny: What size shoes do you wear?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, there you go.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But if you don’t come back soon, there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You hear that?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a doctor!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe I will too!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you remember talking to me yesterday?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ding dong, the psycho's gone.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that’s me and Ross.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I m upset for you.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh, come on in.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe we should keep them here with you.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your live-in boy.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes, we had the sex.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do realise that's your brother?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m so pathetic!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, he's right, I'm totally lying.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler, Chandler Bing.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it haunts me?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which technically now you should give back!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Joey?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, whats the next little bit?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bring your nerves of steel.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is Chandler Bing!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just put it under your dress.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know it'll be like, So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think I can explain this.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, say you do that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that sounds great.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here just take this.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t care!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said that?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're nervous?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn’t know that.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course the balloon.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're from New York.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it would be you!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s possible.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you seeing anybody right now?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that your new walk?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re doing great.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh the humanity.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you crazy?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: huh?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would Monica let me wear this?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Pheebs, whats up?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cheese.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s not charity, Joe.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is the point of having them if we never use them?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's this?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right I'll have one.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well, then, II have to go to the bathroom.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know anything about disciplining a child.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then I’ll just bring them both over.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Scarring?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ernie.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I get pedicures!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, gorgeous.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's not the worst part.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You move in with her right now!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gary's such a great guy!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could I borrow it?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And she'll go, No-no-no, it's Chandler.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, a quick one.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds good to me, but what would a guy think?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We re doomed.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Big dog?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, y'know your not though.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What time is it?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, great.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes that was mine.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that a real thing?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is James Bond’s tux?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re not eloping.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s so hard!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I could probably say 'Let's move in together.'</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's almost rude, that I'm not.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, we're standing out ground apparently.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah you are!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, five.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was so careful!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What're we gonna do?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: There are seven?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We did lie.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you funny?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He will, Joe.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've done this.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I do.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Watch.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He went crazy!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, hear me out.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wouldn't read too much into it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does she still feel bad?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like you have a routine?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: At a fake game!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello sweet pants!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill free phone sex.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Julie hi!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why don’t you prove it?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking about?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Either, it makes no difference.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: WENUS.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right across the street?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought that was for the actual wedding.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey you broke my chair!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s terrible!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Goodnight.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's just interesting.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, if you say so sir.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is amazing.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's clearly not over you.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You re definitely scaring her.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont have your boots.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But after chapter 16: fat, single and ready to mingle, I was uplifted.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, did you see that?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre, is it a vestibule?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said, I said You're so great and then I just, I just stopped talking!</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, this is.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have you seen any?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because of the weekend, we had a fight.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I’ll go get it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, no way!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean should we just do it?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is there something, repellant, about me?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its sucks.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So how're you doing?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'I'll hold you close in my arms.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whats the matter?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: USO?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He took my joke, he took it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just have to know, okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called leihalalokos.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is going to be fun.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right, right.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was very drunk and I was somebody else's subconscious.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you insane?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're worried about you.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, bye!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing?</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, man.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Give it to me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after ASS it is a bit of a challenge.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: There you are!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All my energy is going into not asking that question.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, give me a second!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, she's goin' somewhere.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this from the cry-for-help department.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is this for?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well there you have it!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, great.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He just lopped it right off.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re going to dinner tonight.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look I, I can't.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So in the words of A.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And Doug wants us to play tennis with them.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here we go.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said, Like what?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't mean now.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a girl?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again true.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But nothing has.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: New haircut?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is important is while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but there is a big difference.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no no no no.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Awful play, man.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I would never lie to get someone into bed.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, can I talk to you for a second?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right buddy, time to roll over.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are a lot hotter than I am.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: This girl thing is dangerous.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: To Put the Camera Away!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again, what?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because its awesome.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: From now on, I have no first name.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t get myself right out of them!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I survived college with him!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't, I can't.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Expect it in 4-6 weeks.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, what’s at 8:00?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, we only went out once.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No thank you!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you not understand the story?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or we could keep doing this.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a racecar.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm going to end it with her before it starts.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You feel complete.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she see us yet?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's all glued together.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, it's been three days, okay.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna talk about people's feelings?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. Ok, thank you.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: She went like this!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No one supposed to know about us!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aaaaand, hernia.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because she never calls me!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't see it that way.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just consider us.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Robert's coming out.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got waaaay too much free time.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that’s a full cup!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Clearly you're having sex with him.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oh, what are you doing?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Her initials.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab, hop in.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: your ass?!?!?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who the hell is Carl?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And now we're back.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But, ehm, my bosses didn't go for it.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can tell us.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well then why can’t I see it?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Necklace?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's not gonna be a next time!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forget it!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know where everything goes.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, that was also true an hour ago!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And what youre doing feels so good.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I help, we can find ‘em faster!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: He stole my joke.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right buddy, way to go!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no no no, she's a total wack job.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: At least let me smoke it to the good part.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it a hundred percent cotton?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: See I, did it again.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Definitely not easier with coins.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, there he is!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, not me.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was an idiot back then.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes you did!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, you'd think I would've.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the mrs.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You big freak of nature.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t like anything from my Scottish heritage.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that was yours?</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: How hard is that?!</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s right.</s>

<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not a dad.</s>
<s>ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont want you to get me a stripper.</s>
