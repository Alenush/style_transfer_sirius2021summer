<s>JOEY: Yeah-yeah, I noticed that!</s>
<s>JOEY: But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.</s>
<s>JOEY: My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.</s>

<s>JOEY: How do you do that?</s>
<s>JOEY: Wait-wait!</s>
<s>JOEY: Good luck, good luck!</s>
<s>JOEY: Okay?</s>

<s>JOEY: Yknow what?</s>
<s>JOEY: Y’know what?</s>

<s>JOEY: Heh, who's stupid now?</s>
<s>JOEY: Come on!</s>
<s>JOEY: I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadnt and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and I havent bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?</s>
<s>JOEY: And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.</s>
<s>JOEY: No-no-no, no it s uh, it s okay.</s>

<s>JOEY: He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey mouths Oops!</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails.</s>
<s>JOEY: What're the odds of that happening?</s>
<s>JOEY: It’s awesome!</s>

<s>JOEY: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!</s>
<s>JOEY: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?</s>
<s>JOEY: Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?</s>

<s>JOEY: So you're really doing this, huh?</s>
<s>JOEY: Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother Ramone.</s>

<s>JOEY: I would love to wait with you guys!</s>
<s>JOEY: So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.</s>

<s>JOEY: The producers are going to be so mad at me.</s>
<s>JOEY: In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is.</s>
<s>JOEY: We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it.</s>
<s>JOEY: Now I have something.</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey!</s>
<s>JOEY: Man, you made me lose it!</s>

<s>JOEY: That, is not a cat!</s>
<s>JOEY: I don't know.</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey!</s>
<s>JOEY: The casting director told her that I missed my chance.</s>
<s>JOEY: I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey.</s>
<s>JOEY: Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!</s>
<s>JOEY: Consider it done.</s>
<s>JOEY: Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey.</s>
<s>JOEY: So do ya wanna kiss again?</s>
<s>JOEY: Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in.</s>
<s>JOEY: Well maybe I love ya’.</s>

<s>JOEY: Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place.</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah.</s>
<s>JOEY: King!</s>
<s>JOEY: If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?</s>
<s>JOEY: Joey!</s>
<s>JOEY: I really want this part!</s>
<s>JOEY: She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.</s>
<s>JOEY: It took three guys to get the thing in there!</s>
<s>JOEY: You knew this all along and you never told me?</s>
<s>JOEY: There is something.</s>
<s>JOEY: Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh that’s too bad.</s>
<s>JOEY: Welcome back to the world!</s>
<s>JOEY: That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.</s>
<s>JOEY: I'm Italian!</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh, that's cool.</s>
<s>JOEY: So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.</s>
<s>JOEY: Her mind is totally acrimonious.</s>
<s>JOEY: Why, why do I keep going after the wrong girls?</s>
<s>JOEY: Aw!</s>
<s>JOEY: Well, no, not exactly!</s>
<s>JOEY: Funny one!</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey Annabelle.</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah, I gotta go!</s>
<s>JOEY: And you’ll be nice?</s>
<s>JOEY: Al Zebooker everybody.</s>
<s>JOEY: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.</s>
<s>JOEY: Uhm, oh.</s>
<s>JOEY: You got it.</s>
<s>JOEY: Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be!</s>
<s>JOEY: I can do that.</s>
<s>JOEY: Well.</s>
<s>JOEY: Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did.</s>
<s>JOEY: That’s even worse!</s>
<s>JOEY: I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?</s>
<s>JOEY: You almost had me.</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.</s>
<s>JOEY: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.</s>
<s>JOEY: You're a nurse.</s>
<s>JOEY: Y’know?</s>
<s>JOEY: I was there!</s>
<s>JOEY: That’s not what she said last night.</s>

<s>JOEY: Is this what it’s like to be you?</s>
<s>JOEY: Sure I do!</s>
<s>JOEY: Yknow why dont I hold on to him so that theres no confusion?</s>
<s>JOEY: Y’know?</s>
<s>JOEY: When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know?</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh thats amazing.</s>
<s>JOEY: What award are you practicing for?</s>
<s>JOEY: Hit me!</s>
<s>JOEY: Hold on.</s>
<s>JOEY: Uh, yeah.</s>
<s>JOEY: Sounds good.</s>
<s>JOEY: Dont tell her Im here!</s>
<s>JOEY: No baby!</s>
<s>JOEY: Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.</s>
<s>JOEY: You do have a choice!</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah?</s>
<s>JOEY: This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!</s>
<s>JOEY: I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?</s>
<s>JOEY: There's gravy?</s>
<s>JOEY: No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.</s>
<s>JOEY: But if you weren't my best friend.</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah, yeah.</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey that’s not true!</s>
<s>JOEY: No.</s>
<s>JOEY: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?!</s>
<s>JOEY: It’s not so silly anymore!</s>
<s>JOEY: Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist.</s>
<s>JOEY: But that was a hell of a kiss.</s>
<s>JOEY: Slow down, you go way too fast.</s>
<s>JOEY: No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.</s>
<s>JOEY: Aaahhh, look at you two, holding hands, huh is this getting serious?</s>
<s>JOEY: Well, I can't use these forever.</s>
<s>JOEY: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.</s>
<s>JOEY: Hey!</s>
<s>JOEY: And plus he kills a bunch of them!</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh!</s>
<s>JOEY: I’m very upset.</s>
<s>JOEY: No!</s>
<s>JOEY: Wow.</s>
<s>JOEY: Okay, see that blind guy right there?</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh we flipped for it.</s>
<s>JOEY: I wanna sit in my chair!</s>
<s>JOEY: Whoops!</s>
<s>JOEY: It's stuck!</s>
<s>JOEY: It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is.</s>
<s>JOEY: I couldn't even find it on the map.</s>
<s>JOEY: Did you hear that?</s>
<s>JOEY: Alright, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking!</s>
<s>JOEY: C'mon, sit.</s>
<s>JOEY: We uh, we used to work together.</s>
<s>JOEY: Fake?</s>
<s>JOEY: Will you relax?!</s>
<s>JOEY: So you-you-you-you were saying?</s>
<s>JOEY: Im done.</s>
<s>JOEY: I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.</s>
<s>JOEY: No-no, Kathy.</s>
<s>JOEY: Erin!</s>
<s>JOEY: I dont know.</s>
<s>JOEY: But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.</s>
<s>JOEY: Seventeen-fourteen Giants, three minutes to go in the third.</s>
<s>JOEY: Huh.</s>
<s>JOEY: Huh?</s>
<s>JOEY: I'm just trying to get comfortable.</s>
<s>JOEY: I’ll see you at 8:00.</s>
<s>JOEY: I didn’t know he could get me fired!</s>
<s>JOEY: So, this is new.</s>
<s>JOEY: Okay, its an audio question, name this television theme song.</s>

<s>JOEY: Let's see, she's on the third floor.</s>
<s>JOEY: Alright, it still works.</s>
<s>JOEY: Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!</s>
<s>JOEY: Ok.</s>
<s>JOEY: All right, when was 1990?</s>

<s>JOEY: No, Ross your mayor of the zone!</s>
<s>JOEY: Days Of Our Lives.</s>
<s>JOEY: Thats always appropriate!</s>
<s>JOEY: Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.</s>
<s>JOEY: Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?</s>
<s>JOEY: Oh, wish me luck!</s>
<s>JOEY: Didn't I tell ya?</s>
