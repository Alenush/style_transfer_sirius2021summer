<s>RACHEL: What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!</s>
<s>RACHEL: Okay, aahhh.</s>
<s>RACHEL: No wait a minute!</s>
<s>RACHEL: So yknow, I have all of these feelings and I dont know what to do about them, because I cant date like a normal person, which is fine because I dont need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.</s>
<s>RACHEL: You are so sweet.</s>
<s>RACHEL: What?</s>

<s>RACHEL: That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!</s>
<s>RACHEL: It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.</s>

<s>RACHEL: I mean, shes a little slutty, but who isnt?</s>
<s>RACHEL: It was nothing!</s>
