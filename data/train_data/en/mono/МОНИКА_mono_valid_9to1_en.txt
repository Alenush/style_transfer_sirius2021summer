<s>MONICA: Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!</s>
<s>MONICA: This dinner is gonna be so great!</s>
<s>MONICA: Im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey.</s>
<s>MONICA: I miss that so much now.</s>
<s>MONICA: Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, hey Ross!</s>
<s>MONICA: You know, I would give her up, for you.</s>
<s>MONICA: So, are you sorry that I told them?</s>
<s>MONICA: That's true.</s>
<s>MONICA: And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.</s>
<s>MONICA: That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, maybe a little.</s>
<s>MONICA: He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making.</s>
<s>MONICA: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.</s>
<s>MONICA: ‘Cause I just keep thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have, and it’s freaking me out.</s>
<s>MONICA: The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!</s>
<s>MONICA: My God, I can’t believe this!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok. We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here.</s>
<s>MONICA: I thought you were taking Ross to the game?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place?</s>
<s>MONICA: I didn’t make it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Im not touching you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, we were a great couple.</s>
<s>MONICA: First one there wins!</s>
<s>MONICA: You sold me out.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?!</s>
<s>MONICA: That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!</s>
<s>MONICA: What-what are you talking about?</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohh!</s>
<s>MONICA: Will you stop!</s>
<s>MONICA: Is all I wanted!</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.</s>
<s>MONICA: When it stays light real late.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, it's ready.</s>
<s>MONICA: Go over to Joey’s.</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, this terrible!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yes!</s>
<s>MONICA: I want a baby.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, I love this street.</s>
<s>MONICA: They played it right before Jackass.</s>
<s>MONICA: About a half an hour.</s>
<s>MONICA: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!</s>
<s>MONICA: Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm not okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Everything stays the same!</s>
<s>MONICA: I know.</s>
<s>MONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?</s>
<s>MONICA: Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Guys!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh.</s>
<s>MONICA: How?</s>
<s>MONICA: Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.</s>
<s>MONICA: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!</s>
<s>MONICA: I'll go in there.</s>
<s>MONICA: Huh?</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah.</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, you are a bad ass!</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm.</s>
<s>MONICA: Maybe the other couple will.</s>
<s>MONICA: There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's hard this whole platonic thing.</s>
<s>MONICA: Keep going.</s>
<s>MONICA: What do you think of the house?</s>
<s>MONICA: Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding.</s>
<s>MONICA: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?</s>
<s>MONICA: No!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, we had a little fight.</s>
<s>MONICA: I was great!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, get out!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah!</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler and I are moving in together!</s>
<s>MONICA: Surprise her!</s>
<s>MONICA: I know.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh crap!</s>
<s>MONICA: That's it.</s>
<s>MONICA: I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.</s>
<s>MONICA: Larry?</s>
<s>MONICA: Bye.</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebes?</s>
<s>MONICA: No!</s>
<s>MONICA: It's Phoebe!</s>
<s>MONICA: Worked like a charm.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, hi, Ross.</s>
<s>MONICA: IIs.</s>
<s>MONICA: How was sailing?</s>
<s>MONICA: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.</s>
<s>MONICA: THAT'S NOT ME!</s>
<s>MONICA: You're water broke!</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebes hogging the game!</s>
<s>MONICA: Now there you go!</s>
<s>MONICA: Really!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, look!</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey, please come.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, come on Ms. PacMan.</s>
<s>MONICA: Rach!</s>
<s>MONICA: You love me!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?!</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Say you're sorry.</s>
<s>MONICA: You are way off, lady!</s>
<s>MONICA: And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?</s>
<s>MONICA: So, I guess you're next.</s>
<s>MONICA: You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.</s>
<s>MONICA: Shhh!</s>
<s>MONICA: Sob fest 2002.</s>
<s>MONICA: Then you need to go to the airport and tell her.</s>
<s>MONICA: We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.</s>
<s>MONICA: Mon-i-ca!</s>
<s>MONICA: Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.</s>
<s>MONICA: All jealous.</s>
<s>MONICA: I can’t believe this!</s>
<s>MONICA: Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wanna give me a hand?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hasn’t it ever happened to you?</s>
<s>MONICA: What didn’t you tell us you work here?</s>
<s>MONICA: Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.</s>
<s>MONICA: I’m no longer a bride.</s>
<s>MONICA: That does not mean you know us better, II want a rematch.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: I think I just cracked a rib.</s>
<s>MONICA: Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: You’re so incredible!</s>
<s>MONICA: No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.</s>
<s>MONICA: Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember?</s>
<s>MONICA: Richard buzzed.</s>
<s>MONICA: That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!</s>
<s>MONICA: My God you’re great!</s>
<s>MONICA: What did I just step on?</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe?</s>
<s>MONICA: No, here's your mail.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: You’re invisible now.</s>
<s>MONICA: Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, I mean, you know what I mean.</s>
<s>MONICA: Gotcha!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oooh!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, that's it.</s>
<s>MONICA: I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.</s>
<s>MONICA: Damn it, I did not think this through!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok. Great.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm sure everything's fine.</s>
<s>MONICA: So what, so what you saw him with a girl?</s>
<s>MONICA: Kinda like your Barca lounger.</s>
<s>MONICA: He’s not a horrible guy.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica.</s>
<s>MONICA: This place is really my Grandmother’s.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different!</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?</s>
<s>MONICA: They love my candy?</s>
<s>MONICA: How can I lose you?</s>
<s>MONICA: Im getting a lot of use out of them already!</s>
<s>MONICA: Absolutely.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'll make it just like Mom's.</s>
<s>MONICA: You'll be fine.</s>
<s>MONICA: That had been your window.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?</s>
<s>MONICA: You married her, didn’t you?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Do I take classes at the New School?</s>
<s>MONICA: Theyre mine!</s>
<s>MONICA: I know!</s>
<s>MONICA: Other wall!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh wow!</s>
<s>MONICA: Friends.</s>

<s>MONICA: You’re kidding!</s>
<s>MONICA: I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off!</s>
<s>MONICA: But then everyone will know.</s>
<s>MONICA: It was my grandmother's.</s>
<s>MONICA: She hates those corporate massage chains.</s>
<s>MONICA: We’ll just we’ll just let her stay.</s>
<s>MONICA: We're having sex whether you're here or not.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.</s>

<s>MONICA: I was thrown out of a hotel!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, he was talking about rules.</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe.</s>
<s>MONICA: But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message.</s>
<s>MONICA: Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Pass the cheese, please.</s>
<s>MONICA: You gotta feel this bad boy.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: No, more like US lost office!</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!</s>
<s>MONICA: No, seriously.</s>
<s>MONICA: You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.</s>
<s>MONICA: Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.</s>
<s>MONICA: So were gonna try?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.</s>
<s>MONICA: The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes.</s>
<s>MONICA: The worst has happened!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, that we totally understand.</s>
<s>MONICA: What the hell is that dog doing here?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Say good-bye to sore muscles!</s>
<s>MONICA: We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.</s>
<s>MONICA: All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favour?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.</s>
<s>MONICA: Find out what they want.</s>
<s>MONICA: So, we did okay at the strip club, right?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean that, that’s great!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey!</s>
<s>MONICA: I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.</s>
<s>MONICA: Surprised to see me?</s>

<s>MONICA: All right, sweetie that's fine.</s>
<s>MONICA: Where is he, where's Richard?</s>
<s>MONICA: No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them!</s>
<s>MONICA: They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me.</s>
<s>MONICA: I know!</s>
<s>MONICA: Now Im betting against all three of you?</s>
<s>MONICA: What is the big deal?</s>
<s>MONICA: Anybody else got a problem?</s>
<s>MONICA: I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: No!</s>
<s>MONICA: Made to order!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.</s>

<s>MONICA: You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?!</s>
<s>MONICA: What if he reads it in the paper?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, just get a lot better.</s>
<s>MONICA: And again, were so sorry.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.</s>

<s>MONICA: Hi.</s>
<s>MONICA: Youve been acting weird all afternoon.</s>
<s>MONICA: There’s.</s>

<s>MONICA: And it’s a magnet!</s>
<s>MONICA: Did you see me out there?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: You're just heartless!</s>
<s>MONICA: Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.</s>
<s>MONICA: Great!</s>
<s>MONICA: Let's kill 'um!</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe!</s>

<s>MONICA: I thought they'd brighten up the place.</s>

<s>MONICA: So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?</s>
<s>MONICA: I wa.</s>
<s>MONICA: Really?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, we grew up together!</s>
<s>MONICA: We’re hanging out.</s>
<s>MONICA: We're just making conversation.</s>
<s>MONICA: Look what I got!</s>
<s>MONICA: Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great!, I was thinking we would eat around four.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, you're so wonderful.</s>
<s>MONICA: I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.</s>
<s>MONICA: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!</s>
<s>MONICA: If you're not going then I don't want to go either.</s>
<s>MONICA: Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.</s>
<s>MONICA: There isn't time!</s>
<s>MONICA: That's great.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!</s>
<s>MONICA: No, sorry sweety.</s>
<s>MONICA: Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!</s>
<s>MONICA: I’ll pick it up for you!</s>
<s>MONICA: And your license expired.</s>
<s>MONICA: So, what do you think?</s>
<s>MONICA: I did not yell.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, high school was not my favourite time.</s>
<s>MONICA: So?</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, maybe you should send him something.</s>
<s>MONICA: Really well.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey-hey, how goes the dancing?</s>
<s>MONICA: This is my dress!</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God!</s>
<s>MONICA: Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?</s>
<s>MONICA: This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!</s>
<s>MONICA: Let’s go big bunny!</s>
<s>MONICA: Pick up!</s>
<s>MONICA: And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore.</s>
<s>MONICA: You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up.</s>
<s>MONICA: I don't know, clean places?</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: My guy has diplomatic coupons.</s>

<s>MONICA: What is with you?</s>
<s>MONICA: I know, what about Rachel?</s>
<s>MONICA: You don't know everything.</s>
<s>MONICA: I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple.</s>
<s>MONICA: Did you hear that?!</s>
<s>MONICA: You just wait by the phone.</s>
<s>MONICA: Sure!</s>
<s>MONICA: Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.</s>
<s>MONICA: Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.</s>
<s>MONICA: Here.</s>
<s>MONICA: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess.</s>
<s>MONICA: Have you been here long?</s>

<s>MONICA: All right, I guess we should go.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh God!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.</s>
<s>MONICA: No, those first two windows, that's the lobby.</s>

<s>MONICA: Dinner's ready!</s>
<s>MONICA: It’s okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: How ‘bout just a boom?</s>
<s>MONICA: Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.</s>

<s>MONICA: So what now?</s>
<s>MONICA: I sold that to Joey.</s>
<s>MONICA: Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!</s>
<s>MONICA: That’s very funny!</s>
<s>MONICA: My surprise party!</s>
<s>MONICA: Once the egg decends into the ovaries.</s>
<s>MONICA: Forty-two!</s>
<s>MONICA: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.</s>
<s>MONICA: And guess what!</s>
<s>MONICA: That's it.</s>
<s>MONICA: Take it!</s>
<s>MONICA: What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!?</s>
<s>MONICA: Right?</s>
<s>MONICA: Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.</s>
<s>MONICA: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh honey, let's go.</s>
<s>MONICA: He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.</s>
<s>MONICA: What, forget it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Wooo.</s>
<s>MONICA: My uterus is an inhospitable environment?</s>
<s>MONICA: Hi, Ben.</s>

<s>MONICA: So, where do you want to go?</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh.</s>
<s>MONICA: No, you've messed it up.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase.</s>

<s>MONICA: Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God, my ass is sweating!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay everybody, let’s go!</s>
<s>MONICA: We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad.</s>
<s>MONICA: I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.</s>
<s>MONICA: If Phoebe were my maid of honor.</s>
<s>MONICA: I am loud!</s>
<s>MONICA: Waitwait, what's with you?</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.</s>
<s>MONICA: Used to!</s>
<s>MONICA: I made her.</s>
<s>MONICA: He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!</s>
<s>MONICA: That’s it.</s>
<s>MONICA: I knew I married you for a reason!</s>
<s>MONICA: Right on schedule.</s>
<s>MONICA: Very funny.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay, well, bye!</s>

<s>MONICA: Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh man!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's okay.</s>
<s>MONICA: I should've told you.</s>
<s>MONICA: It was such an obvious joke!</s>
<s>MONICA: I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.</s>
<s>MONICA: Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Hi.</s>
<s>MONICA: She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well you look incredible too!</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, who would do that?!</s>
<s>MONICA: Yeah-huh!</s>
<s>MONICA: So, what are you saying now?</s>
<s>MONICA: Chris says they’re closing down the bar.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh God!</s>
<s>MONICA: Someone get me a glass!</s>
<s>MONICA: Those are my breasts.</s>

<s>MONICA: You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?</s>
<s>MONICA: Look at it!</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh he's nice.</s>
<s>MONICA: All teams execute on my count.</s>
<s>MONICA: Just go over and say hi.</s>
<s>MONICA: It's just that ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too.</s>
<s>MONICA: Are you awake?</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay!</s>
<s>MONICA: Ya know, I was thinking.</s>
<s>MONICA: Hi!</s>
<s>MONICA: It's the miracle of life!</s>
<s>MONICA: Where have you been?</s>
<s>MONICA: Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me.</s>
<s>MONICA: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?</s>
<s>MONICA: Okay?</s>
<s>MONICA: They just gonna love you, just be yourself.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.</s>
<s>MONICA: What?</s>
<s>MONICA: Joey look it’s really sweet… That is true.</s>
<s>MONICA: Ohh, I’m such an idiot.</s>
<s>MONICA: I was uh, a little bigger then.</s>
<s>MONICA: Wow.</s>
<s>MONICA: I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what?</s>
<s>MONICA: Four weeks!</s>
<s>MONICA: Mr. Heckles.</s>
<s>MONICA: Uh, yes, I did.</s>
<s>MONICA: Oh my God!</s>
<s>MONICA: You know the words!</s>
<s>MONICA: So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!</s>
<s>MONICA: Thank you!</s>
<s>MONICA: We're gonna go then.</s>
<s>MONICA: No, it was a fight.</s>
<s>MONICA: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, You can't go to the game.</s>
<s>MONICA: Like a log.</s>
<s>MONICA: Uh, work's good.</s>
<s>MONICA: Yes!</s>
<s>MONICA: Well, I love it.</s>
<s>MONICA: How've you been?</s>
<s>MONICA: Umm.</s>
<s>MONICA: Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!</s>
<s>MONICA: No.</s>
<s>MONICA: Jody.</s>
<s>MONICA: Do you want to go out on a date with her?</s>
<s>MONICA: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!</s>
<s>MONICA: It isn't mine!</s>
