<s>PHOEBE: Okay, I'm ready.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Whoa, she's gone.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: But we've only had one job.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Okay, I'm gonna go too!</s>

<s>PHOEBE: I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: No.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh my God!</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Umm, is Vince here?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yes, but I'm doing this.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: She didn't gossip at all.</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Phoebe, yeah.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: This is where I play.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Oh, I hear divorce bells.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: So-so you two were married huh?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Maybe, maybe youre overreacting!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Um, well, get over it.</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Huh!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: This is so hard!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, I love paper mache!</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Just give me a chance, okay.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Hey.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: All I could think of was y’know, Is he gonna kiss me?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Well, so tell me everything about my parents.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Yeah.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: All right, then I need to calm down a little.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Uh-huh, me too.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yeah.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: But you'll never make it stick and you know it!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: They're gonna call her Chandler.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: You know thats thats her.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Really, it doesn't mean anything.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Okay.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Where's the birthday cake?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I would love it.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I am furious with him!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yes.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, Ja!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: So I guess she wont be totally alone.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I'll be back in-in a little bit.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Eww, look.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Sounds like youre a little jealous.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yeah.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: No-no!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Come on!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I think it went into me.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Of course I can!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yeah?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh now, don't give away the farm!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: A stupid contest?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, so this is all about money!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Shh!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Ohh, who’s the silver fox?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Okay?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: My Grandma had the exact same bag!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Umm, that paper's two weeks old.</s>

<s>PHOEBE: If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Well, how about a compromise then, okay?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Very merry.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: It’s not.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Uh-hmm.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: What harpist?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Well, uhm, listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and, uhm, well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: No!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: He went to get lotion.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: What?!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I knew it!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Sure, what, what was the work thing?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Wow, this is a lot!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Okay.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: No-no, I got that.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: You’re just so mean to each other!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Can't a girl finish a song around here?</s>
<s>PHOEBE: For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: It's okay.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh, nothing.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Yeah!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: It's just, er, it's my friends.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Shoo!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.</s>

<s>PHOEBE: Now I have a sister too!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Why are you laughing?!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: I love you too.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.</s>

<s>PHOEBE: And, as always no one talk to me after the show.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: We ruined everything.</s>
<s>PHOEBE: They called and you didn't get it!</s>

<s>PHOEBE: He's totally ok with seeing you!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Just kidding!</s>
<s>PHOEBE: Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.</s>
