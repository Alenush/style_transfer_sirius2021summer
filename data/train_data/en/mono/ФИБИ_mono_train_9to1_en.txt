<s>ФИБИ: Ahh-ahh!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You know about the plate thing?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I figured out a way to make money!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Umm, you make something up.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Ohh-oh, chilling!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Allright, so we should just give them away.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: No, I want you to have it.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: All right, then I need to calm down a little.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Uh-huh, me too.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: But you'll never make it stick and you know it!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: They're gonna call her Chandler.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You know thats thats her.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Really, it doesn't mean anything.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Okay.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Where's the birthday cake?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I would love it.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I am furious with him!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yes.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, Ja!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: So I guess she wont be totally alone.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I'll be back in-in a little bit.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Eww, look.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Sounds like youre a little jealous.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: No-no!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Come on!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I think it went into me.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Of course I can!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh now, don't give away the farm!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: A stupid contest?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, so this is all about money!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Shh!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Ohh, who’s the silver fox?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Okay?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: My Grandma had the exact same bag!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Umm, that paper's two weeks old.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You're kidding!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Hey.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: Cool Aunt Phoebe.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh wait!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Well, how about a compromise then, okay?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Very merry.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: It’s not.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Uh-hmm.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: What harpist?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Well, uhm, listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and, uhm, well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: No!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: He went to get lotion.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: What?!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I knew it!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Sure, what, what was the work thing?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Wow, this is a lot!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Okay.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: No-no, I got that.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You’re just so mean to each other!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: It's okay.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, nothing.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: It's just, er, it's my friends.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: Not if I get there first.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I love you too.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: And, as always no one talk to me after the show.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: We ruined everything.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: They called and you didn't get it!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah, I don't need it.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I'm kinda hungry.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: Is it a kind of hot sandwich?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: But… Okay.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You're more than welcome to come with us, right?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: We bought bras.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: We take the same bus.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Yeah, you've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: That doesn’t lock does it?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Do you think he is still following her?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Ross isn’t here!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Monica had lunch with Richard.</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.</s>

<s>ФИБИ: Yep!</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Monica?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Oh you did?</s>
<s>ФИБИ: Does anyone want the rest of this PopTart?</s>
