Hey, what’s going on? I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar." What’s up? Oh my God. Congratulations. Where is she? Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I’m gay! I’m gay!" Can I bring her in? Hey! Wow! Happy Monica’s night! Thanks. Well sure. But I get married all the time so... You okay? You mean, we...you and me? Oh good, you scared me for a minute. I mean...no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times. Surely you can think of something good. What? Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh? My hands? Yeah? Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too. A what? One night, just-just sex. No strings attached? No. Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really...don’t. Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw... It is! It is! Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together! Yeah! It was just a kiss. Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter! Oh no! And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not! Guess who? Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air... Still thinking about it huh? Oh, who cares? And so do I. Okay. Sure. No! Hey, here’s a thought. Got me. Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off. Look uh, if we’re gonna do this... Oh, I see, so everybody wins. Oww! Well, I’m going to take off. Congratulations man. And uh, Rachel. What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys is me. Hi! Oh, I’ll have some! Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name. Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade! And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at... Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here? Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you... Wh-what’s going on? Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler? Phoebe, you said it was urgent! Do you realize I have a classroom full of students? Uh, Phoebe... Phoebe, what are you doing? Phoebe! Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment! And they knew about it? Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want! The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle....beer! Cold beer. Hello. Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night. Can I, can I help you with something? Yes I am. Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. Ohh, that’s soft. Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about? Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh? Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! ‘Sup? Excuse me ladies. I’m sorry? I gave him an extremely professional massage! Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop. Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment. He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry. His daughter was hot. About what? Well, you-you’ve always had glasses. Are you sure? Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight? No, why? My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us. Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you. No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way. Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too. Yeah. You’re not a lefty? Oh, we have to get you an engagement present? No one got me an engagement present. Two! I’ve been engaged twice! Hey. Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand... And what did he ask you not to call him? Over here. ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room. Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part? Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp. Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire? You were trying to eat it! Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed? Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present? Thank you! Hey. Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all. You have to respect the sea! Let’s give it a shot. Ohh, these are pretty good. Which one was that? Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I’m okay. Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! Looking up? Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister? That’s the day you’re gonna die? See...darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day. Ohhhh... It wasn’t the best. Well, the lighting was okay. Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!" Hey! Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner. Hey...Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner? What you got over there? Tacos? Uhh, those are tacos. Eh, either way I’ll pass. I still can’t eat those. What’s so funny?! You told her! Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like...It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!" How could you tell her?! Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City. Well, Chandler and I are in a bar... And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls. Oh Mon, I laughed so hard... Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won! Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too! Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made. Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13! Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm! Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me! And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else. Okay, if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story. Man! Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh... Amazing! Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees. It’s not a club. Hey, divorced men are not bad men! Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired. Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club. I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back. I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that’s why I have to kill you." Yeah? What?! No! Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. All right! I want my key back! It’s right there! Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs. Oh yeah...No...You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later. Hi Whitney. Yep. Okay. Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night. Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay? Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people! Like what? Okay. Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons. Yeah! Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me... Hi. Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay...and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass." Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable! I think he can be. Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life! I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!! So do we!! So do we!! I’m sorry you had to see that. My God! Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was! Wh-what’s up? Oh just say it Kyle! Y’know, he hums when he pees! It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever. That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already. I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little. Yeah, were better off without them. Divorced men’s club. Joey, we just saw it! And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah! Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay? Well, John McClane had plans! What happened?!! We fell asleep! That is all. I think that would be best. Okay. But not about this! No touch! No touch! Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. Just uh, brought back your videos. No! No we don’t! I... I don’t know what you are talking about. I’ve had better. All right! All right! It was the best nap ever! I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey! We can’t do it again. Because it’s weird! Sure, what do you got? No, 10 is the highest. Because it’s the highest. Okay, Rachel you’re up first. Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! Yes, very nice Rachel. When Monica was a little girl, I remember that......Ooh!! Ow! Very good! It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech. Go! Yeah, it really was! Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next although I really don’t see the point. I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close. Actually, it wasn’t that close. Yeah? Why-why would I care about that? It really was. Excuse me. Okay, okay take a guess. Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that? People are doing it in front of my book! My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section! Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around. Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing! Oh for cryin’ out loud! Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437? No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! And don’t you follow me! Yes? Yes?! How can I help you? Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus? Ah....Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution? I find Marion’s views far to progressionist. I’m a professor here uh, Ross...Geller. Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?! Well I uh, I skipped forth grade. I am very...very sorry. Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby to shine in people’s eye......Okay, see you later. Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? What? That's like insanely easy! What? You forgot fourteen states? Wow, how many have you got? Done! With time a-to-spare. You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? What? That's impossible. No, just give me another minute. This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. You're on! Pshhshhh! Phoebe, why is your bag moving? Ohio!! Thank you! What dog? There-there's no dog here. Are you out of your mind? Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!! It's too cold. It hurts my teeth. How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s. Damn, I forgot you were here. Hey! What's she doing back here? Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... Yeah, but, but look what I'm... Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. Because you sent away the dog! Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis....take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. From you? Yes, please! I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something. Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? Ah, what good are you. Delaware! Delaware! I want my turkey now! I know. You sure? No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. Yes! Yes! Yes!! Yeah. What?! Ohh. That is so unfair! Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second. Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so... You like it? Yeah? Ahh. Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride. You’re welcome. Phoebe really likes the bike huh? Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times? Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don’t you? Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set... Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike! Well...In-in case of emergency. Well let there...what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh...I’ll shoot you." Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and...Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay? No! I swear! Come on. All right, here we go. All right? All right. Feel good? All right, try pedaling. That’s it, your doing great. Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes! Yes!! Yes!!! I-I just thought you were doing so well. I... It’s a legitimate learning technique. Wow! Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy. Need some help? By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike. I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe! Phoebe. All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back. Because! Because, it-it-it’s... It’d be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! The bike is dying. Great! Great! You’re making the bike very happy. Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them. Hey! Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year. Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah. Hmm. Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya? Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya? Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up? Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees. Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Okay, it's not a contest. Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah? No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben. No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy! Yes! Santa's coming! Hey! No, these are my pants. Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left? Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something. I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas! Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas. That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents. You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah! You are? Me, too! You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights? Yeah! Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees... What are you doing here, Santa? I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? What are you doing? Thank you, but, but you gotta leave. Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it. I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me. Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye! Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay. All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees. ...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for... That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end. Yeah? The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles! Well, technically it seven billion years ago... Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King. Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it? Huh? What? What? Is it the comet? Joey come...I can’t believe...I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman! Show me where? Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open? Joey! It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! Rachel!! Monica!! I can’t believe this!! Yeah, I guess we don’t have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!! I know, I wasn’t finished. But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!! Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in. Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t. Well, I’m not gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility. Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is? Okay. Well, you be careful. Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die! Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later. I don’t think so. Hello? When you get in there... Okay, do-do you have a good grip? Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now. Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face. I would say that. Okay, here I go. I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight. So what do you want me to do? Hi. M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me. It’s still looks pretty far! Do not rush me!! Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I...Ooh, a quarter! Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That’s weird isn’t it? Sure, do whatever you want. Yeah? Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!! I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us! Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we’re surprised! Who did you leave a message with? I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room. They kept your room for a while. Come on, you know they love you. I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault. Hey. What’s wrong with this year? Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing. What? Dad? Hey! Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house. Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater. Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these? Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher! It’s a clown kit! Clown kit! What? How are you ever going to sell this place? Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed! No! Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her. Well, can you blame her? Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it. Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab.... grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in there. Like uh y’know like this! This! She- she could’ve made this! Right? And this! She-she could’ve won this! Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this? Hey. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory. Well, these. These are yours right here. Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book. Nu-uh! Oh, I don’t know how that got in there. Umm, your boxes are umm... Dad? All right. I think it was a mouse. What?!!! Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?! Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!! Happy birthday!!! We’ve got presents! Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty? Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is? Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child! How hot do I look in this, huh?! That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars. I don’t know, but-but look how shiny! Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. Damnit! Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! Okay, back—Stop! Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop! No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. Maybe that will liven up this party. Stick to the list. Always stick to the list. Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling? What? Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight! You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk. I really wish that you wouldn’t. Come on! Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide! Lift!! And slide! All right everyone, lift! And slide!! God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40? Yes! My baby’s finally free! Woohoo! You wanna buy a car? What’s the matter? You okay? Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too. Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys. Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T. What? A brain transplant?! It’s ridiculous! It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her? What?! Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots. Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more... How did you know about that?! Were you the ones called the cops?! Why not? Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play! No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a wee bit o’ celebration. ...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt. Do you wanna start telling secrets? Now umm, remember I’m still learning. One, two, three, four! You know the song! Sing along! So? You know the song! Sing along! Hi. Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency. Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there? Okay! All clear! Everything okay in there? Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour? Oh, she isn’t home. Well, Ben would be there. What’s the matter? Rach, he’s not an ex-con. I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive. Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay? I wasn’t talking to you. Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour. I have a bone to pick with you. Yes! Ben learned a little trick. That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere! Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them! I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right? Rachel! What are you doing here? Your good friend? What’s her last name? Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face? Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don’t you ever wash your face?" Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny! Hi. Practical jokes. You have a line down your face. Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt! I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay? No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I… Hey! Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so… Okay, I’ll see you later pal. What? What? That’s great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?! All right, that’s it! Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man! Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding! I-I-am— Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her? Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you. I got it. So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime. Ah. Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight? Yeah? Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God! Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again. Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… Hey. Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy. Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose! Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her. Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her… That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her… Okay, okay. This can go on for a while. No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best. Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street… Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates. So let’s decide on the spending limit… I was thinking more like a hundred. Hey! What’s up? Oh thanks! We have 8:00 reservations at Gramercy Bistro. I am dressed. I have an oily T-zone! That’s right. Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though. Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? Why am I not surprised? I don’t think you have much choice. Bye-bye! Yes. Yes. Just here and there . So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. Yeah. Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasm out of control. Hi. It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore. Yeah. So… So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something? That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman? Much better. Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son. That’s right! Wait no, Ben. Well umm… Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food? Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea? Hey you leave Marcel out of this! Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?! Probably around gonorrhea. Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin! …and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. Yes Mr. Lewis? Just a high pitched intimidating noise. Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid I-I had to fail you. Well you need 60% to pass… Seven. No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned? Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem. Well that brings me in the loop a little. Okay! Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs. Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you? There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me. I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me. Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm. Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack. Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you? And why exactly would I do that? What?! No! Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me! What? I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade. Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment? Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back. ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work. Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay——Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel, Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. Shall we? A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America. Cassie? Wow, I haven’t seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes. So what! I still have—No you’re probably right. What—why? What?! Chandler, she’s our cousin! Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now. Cassie?! Hey! Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn’t. It’s okay. Come, come on in. Oh. Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions. Yeah—No!! Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog. Thank God. Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? We’re probably too old to do that now. Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related. Well I’m, I’m a little slow. Just as our children would be. She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in. Say something clever! Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything. She seems really, really fun! What?! So that’s two of my wives. Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux! That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in. So? Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love. Pretty please? Not very uh, 007. When I got married you slept with my sister. Hey! Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together. Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together. What, are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!! Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there. What? Let me see that! Oh man! Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise. Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you. ...everyone, this is Chandler! I’m getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!! Hey! Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions. How’s Monica coming along with her vows? I can’t believe that in four weeks they’re gonnta be married! Phoebe that’s not true. Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long. What's going on? What?! What?! Actually, it looks really good. No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! It’ll be okay Joe. That little naked guy would be me. Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now? Got me. Looks like a fun gang. No-no, that would be me again. Oh man, this is hilarious. Dude! Dude! How-how did you write this? You can’t do that!
