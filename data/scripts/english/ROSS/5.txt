It's all right. Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did! Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head. Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay. Yeah, he's head of the department. Hello. Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway? To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie. Again, it's not that he... Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang. Hey! I just heard. What's up? Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain. I do too! I do too! Argh! Argh! You did it, man. I had to talk loud because the movie was loud! I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit! Hello. Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi! No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me! Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you. She's talking. Hi! Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship. In London! She wants me to move to London. I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben. It could happen. All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben. Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that? Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out. All right, did you just say all right? Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love! Yes, tell me. I know. I am, I am so sorry. Again, very sorry. Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you. Oh that is so great! That's.... So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes. No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again. I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you! Thanks for the help, problem solved. Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken! For what? Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily. It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff. Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants. No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help. Thanks. Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York? Hey. Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her. Damn! I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it. Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. I have no idea. I mean. But-but I assure you I will figure it out. So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right? Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily..... What?! Le Poo's still alive?! Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about? Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing. Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey! You're nose is bleeding! Umm. Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore. Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out. Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage? And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants. ...is for me not to see you anymore. It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here. You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard. What are you doing? Rachel, this is your apartment. You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do. Yes! Please! That's okay. That's not advice! I'm going to the bathroom. Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec? Hi. I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back. No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better? Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do? I can't believe this is happening. I am so sorry. Hey! How come? Everybody else does. Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things. Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's...Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new. Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on. Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine. After what I did? Can you blame her? No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo! Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other. Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time! I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice... Why? What's going on? Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! Yep. Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood. Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now. Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur? You do, huh? What are you talking about? Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh.. It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed. Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back! Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on. Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! Yeah, yeah, she's here. Hi. Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay? Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with. Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me. So, can you trust me? Well, I guess that's it. My marriage is over. Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther. Emily's cousin kicked me out! Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. Who needs a lease when it's family! You got it. Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad. What? Hey roomies! Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here. Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back! Pretty cool, huh? Joey, please! Uh fellas, I'll take sports. All right. Uhh, international. Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here. Oh yeah! You're...hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks! Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio. Okay, let's go. Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it. Oh my God! I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking. So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place? How about you? All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application. Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application. Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So.... Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space. Are you guys sure about this? All right. So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just . Come on, it's fun! I couldn't possibly eat another bite. Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm. I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever. Oh God, no. You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings. In this life, Phoebe. Yeah that's the same. Hey! Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band! Oh, this is Monica. Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food. So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college. Well, that's cool. So did... Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for. Monica! So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week. Yeah. Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night. All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind. Hey! I can't believe you let George Michael slap you. Hey. Happy Thanksgiving! So uh, where's Monica? Dude! Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams! Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it! Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that. Well, they're not mine! Why are they here? Hi. Someone at work ate my sandwich! My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it! Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life! That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?" Phoebe! Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that. That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now! Yeah, of course, Donald. What?! Yeah. Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich. Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here... What? You ate my sandwich? Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with aMoist Maker? Do you perhaps remember seeing a note on top of it? That said it was my sandwich?! What? You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! MY SANDWICH?!!! MY SANDWICH!!!!!! Hey Chandler. Monica! I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today. On account of my rage. He gave me a pill for it. Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it. I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich. What's going on? Dude! That's my sister! Yeah, what's going on? You slept with my sister? This is not good for my rage. My God Monica!! Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?! I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. And top shelf: expired products. Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners. Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical! So what, we just sit? I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys? Or that. I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do. Yeah! All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character. And it can't be Joey. Or Joseph. All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball. This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game! And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on! No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh! So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what? Oh-oh, yeah. Uh, you weighted 200 pounds. Yeah, not since I got too strong for you. Yeah. Oh fine. Joey's not going. Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages. I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball. I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical! And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing. If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine. How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha! No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did! Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball. Yay! I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh? All right. Hey man. About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry. Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart. I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry. I am sorry, Chandler. 73! 72! 71! What? Well, who's gonna kiss my sister. Awww, man! Really? That's a good point. Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe. All right. Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history. Happy New Year, Pheebs! Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99! Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy. Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution. In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week. Ohh. Okay! Hey! I just asked that girl out. Yes it is. See. That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle. Hi, Pheebs! Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle. All right, see you later. Hi! Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before." Okay, seriously, what do you think? What are you, what are you doing? What, to blind my child? My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot? Okay, it must just be me then. That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom? Thanks. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh………. 'Kay! Oh my God! Joey, it's Ross! I need some help! Well, you can help me! Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom... No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't! Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man. Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work? Hold on. They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste! What difference does that make?! Dude, what am I gonna... All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off. I had a problem. This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit! Look at me! Oh, be-because of the leather pants. Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy. Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily! Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!! Hey Pheebs, what's going on? No! No! No! I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks! Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it. Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now. That's okay, Joe. Oh God! Just, y'know out. I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while. Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want! Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say... Okay, I didn't know you would say that. Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids. I am gonna see her again. Hey guys! Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice! Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention. Thanks! Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right? Oh... This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then... Okay. Sometimes I feel... Huh? Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice. OH...MY...GOD!! I am now. Dude, we got to talk. I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad? Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to. Okay. All right. Hey. Sorry. This would be the place where you explain the hat. Hey Pheebs, how's it going? Is everything okay? Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died. Your make-up! What's the part, Anti-man? Hey, how are you holding up? What happened? Wh-what did he say?! Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself. Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings. What kind of problem? Nooooo! Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes. Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place! It would be so cool to live across from you guys! Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is! Ohh. What's going on? What?! What?! Actually, it looks really good. Hey! Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants. No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window. No. No. A basket of mini-muffins. The small one. Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day. Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! Noooo. Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one! Huh? That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline. Well, he had gravity boots. Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat? Right. Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but...I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it. A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished. Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me. Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I...What? No! Wh.. What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here! What the hell are doing?!! I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this! My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news! What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!! You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids... You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather? Hey! Aww. Huh. Ohh. Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again. Hi! Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe. Howard? Oh that's nice. Oh. Uhh... No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in. Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes. No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard. Yes but too me he's just, man. Ugh, can you believe that guy! ...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles. It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles! Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. Oh, no! Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture. Phoebe! What are you doing? You chipped in?! Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money! Yeah, but you're making me look bad! Phoebe? Phoebe? Phoebe? Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go? So uh, what did you tell them about me? Ohh. What?! Ohh, this cake is really good! Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that. Oh-no. No. No. Hey! Yeah, but still, cheap shot! No, I will not! You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me? This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!" No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies. Yeah? Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch! Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go! Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on! Yeah! Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. What's that supposed to mean? Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out. Yeah! Rach? Then tell him quickly. Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times! A loser you did it with 298 times! Okay. Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go. Okay, go left. Left! Left! Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it? Good-good-good. Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me. Oh great! What, you brought Joey? Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica! Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch. Oh, that's me. No! That's-that's my arm! Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. Come on, Chandler. All right. Okay, here we go! All right, ready? Turn. Turn! Turn! Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et! Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore. All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again. I can't believe that didn't work! I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it. That's what I'm telling you. This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half! Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit. I take it. Hey! What's up? Hey Joey! Great stuff huh? Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross. You got ink on your lip. Hey! Who isn't? I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross. Nevermind! I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm... Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or... Umm? I will give you a call. Okay! So uhh, you ready? Sure. Joey... Man! They cannot get enough! Hi! Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning. I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings... Okay!! All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition. Yeah. Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it. You're not his godfather. Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather. Really? That's great! Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, Joey, you look nothing like Ben. Hi. Not so good. Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition! Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this? Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later! Yeah! Yeah, it is. No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird. Seriously that's a lot of cups. Hey! What's up? Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man. Well, you just... What?! Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad. What?! And why wouldn't he get it? Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid? Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see! You're kid's name is Raymond! Joey! Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben! Hey! Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well. No really, I-I am! I feel bad! Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson. I think, sub-consciously... I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part. No! There you go. Thank you! No. Hey! Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion? Wow! How'd you get in there? What the hell was that?! The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?! It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut " Yeah, right. I'm good. And on your anniversary, for shame! Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl! Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it. Well... Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place. And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little... This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat. I'll get it! I will get that! Hi! Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys. The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair. You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys. You couldn't let me have her, could ya?! This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there! Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl! Really?! And thank you, for that. What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you. All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu! Are you sure? Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh? Do you like it? Okay, I'm working on my flirting. Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left! Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting. You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name? Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens? Gas? Wow! Intense. Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has? They put that in. The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak. A lot of other gas smells... Meth-methane smells... Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet! Was I talking to her about gas? Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. Yeah? What do you mean? And she just gave you this? Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors. Well that I can believe. And she's supposed to buy this?! Hm-mmm. Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. What? Where? What am I looking at? Me too! Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart! That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy. He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him! Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya? It's the...Chandler!! So where are we going next? Yeah, no one talks like that! Hey, I'm more cop than you two! Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner! Umm, jealous! Yeah, no problem. Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home! What is it? What? What? What? What is it? Uh-huh. Thank Joey! Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car... Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me! Yeah, but-but he didn't know that! And it could've just as easily have been a bullet. Wow! I could've died tonight. I do have a newfound respect for life. Rach, what uh, what are you doing here? Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience! Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? And somebody took a shot at me! No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now. Okay, why are you here? You talked to her? Well, okay, what-what did she say? Wow! Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course! Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily. Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something! You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know? Huh. That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her. Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day. Hey, thanks Rach. Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. "Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that. Hey umm, was-was Monica here? Yeah, I want my money back. Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real? I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something. I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us. Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island. Also an island. 2:17. Are you serious?! Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch! You bought Shawn Cassidy! What-what is it?! Why is it inside out?! How much did you pay for that? Yeah? How much? ON A CAT??!!!! Free cats do that too, y'know. Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh? Yeah? Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it! What? I know! Don't switch hands, okay? ...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?! How do you know? You don't have a watch. Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball! 2 hours, 27 minutes. Hey Rach! Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it! Yeah. Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat. Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? All right. Baking it didn't help, huh? I'm starving! I'm still hungry! I am! Oh, thank God! I know. My arm is killing me. What's going on? Oh God, here we go! Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park. All right, bye! Later! Hey! Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight? I don't know, umm... What's with her? Okay. Action. Dude, you are sick. Hey! I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15. All right! Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on! Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did! Well, I don't know. Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay? Okay. So we're, we're good? All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay? ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me! Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this? Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells? Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike? Yeah? Sometimes it's... Okay, I'm the baby. Hey! Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay? What do you like better flora or fauna? Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle? Why are you mad at me? When did I say you were boring?! Phoebe! You and I have never played chess! Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide? Hey! Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this. What'd you say? Is that supposed to be an insult? So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday. Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes... Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I? Hey. May I come in? Do you want me too? So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is! The physical act of love. Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness? You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness. No! No! No! No-no-no-no. Can we, can we just forget this ever happened? Thank you. All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. Yep! That's hilarious! Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too. Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building. What?! You totally get embarrassed! Is that so? Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? What the? What... Ohh, it was the best! I think the check in is that way. Phoebe! Hey, you wet my pants! Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. What? Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people. What? No-no, a lurker. Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then... No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot. Uh-hmm. My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance...karate lessons. Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. What?! Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure? Joey!! Thanks man. Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie. Your what? What?! That's not gonna make you any money! Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off. Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it. Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad. Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear! Okay, there was some staring and pointing.

Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh? All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
