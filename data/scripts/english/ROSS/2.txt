Rache! It was, it was great. Oh, what happened? You're bleeding. Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel. That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie. And bus. You gotta hear this story. But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby. Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time. Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee? Thank you. I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? It was you, pal. Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. I didn't order lemonade. But- How is that the silver lining? Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. Hello? Hi. Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y- Rachel! I'll just call her back. Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching. Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here? So, uh, he's back. No, not a problem. How's the hair? Hey, what's goin' on? What? what? Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you? I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache. Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!" What's goin' on? Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot? Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all? What are you guys doing? Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world. This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. Hi, honey. Hello to the rest. So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow? It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this. Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. My mommies love me. That's clever. Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that. It's breast milk. Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? No! Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. I did not freak out. Because it's breast milk. It's gross. No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. That would be no. You've tasted it? You've tasted it. Oh, you've tasted it. Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel. Oh why?....don`t tell me, because of the huge nostril thing? I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples. Not hating Yanni is not a real reason. We'll give you Janice. Sure, sweepin'. You never know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution? You don't believe in evolution? Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy? Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity. You uh, you don't believe in gravity? How can you not believe in evolution? Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time. You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over. Well, there you go. Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs? Please tell me you're joking. No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because-- Is there blood coming out of my ears? You remember Janice, right? Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old. It's the only possibility, Phoebe. There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility. What? You comin'? You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental. Whip it out, whip it out. Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? You were in a porno? So what's it shaped like? So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know? Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? OK sweetie, I'll see you later. Hey. Hey? Can I ask you somethin'? Naa. OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex? Technically, huh, no. No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . . It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird. What? Sexy? No kidding? What? You'd wait? Really? Women really want this? Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. Hi everyone. I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . . Pop it in. What's wrong with people having sex? Looks to me like he's the one getting the job. Goodnight. Oh, no no, I am. Um, no, I uh, I have done it before. I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens. Wha, uhh, what? OK, now I'm nervous. No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know. What, it's not your fault. Really? Uh-huh. Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. Good morning. Twice. Man, I sure miss Julie. You ever figure out what that thing's for? I know. Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob." Oh my god. You are pure evil. Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico. Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you? I'm tellin' you. You can't do this. That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness. Go over there and tell that woman the truth. Go. Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef-- Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing-- Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister-- That's fine, I'll just wait! Monica! Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine? Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls? That sounds great. Same for me. Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks. Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay. So five of us is, $33.50 apiece. Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal. Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine. I hear ya. I, I just never think of money as an issue. That's a good point. Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla? G-gift? The thing's not the gift? Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio. No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together. Not at the concert. Whoo! But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope? Come on. Could you be less enthused? We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here. I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys. Fine. Chandler! Geez! Are you ready? Whoa! You had sex today? Wow. Still doing the screening thing? Bumpy? Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. Excellent, that was excellent. What guys? Oh, yeah. Ross. Hey, you guys. Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night? Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust. It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band. Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know. Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are. Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants. There we go. All better. Come on, don't do this. I don't know. What's in this pie? Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie. And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi. Ugh. Ugh. It's definitely getting worse. Either that or my mouth is getting smaller. You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble? What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital. I don't think tho. Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag. ??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro! Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? Tho? Ohhh. Ok. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand. Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand? Oh. Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? I hope Ben has a little sister. I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken? They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it. I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today? Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt? Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here. Hi guys. Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK? Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy. Uh, actually, we're getting a cat. Uh huh. Yep. Hopefully. Hey Rach. Oh. And how was the date? Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that? OK. Oh, oh, oh. No, I stayed at Julie's last night. Oh actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages? Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael? You're over me? Wha, you're uh, you're, you're over me? When, when were you, under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you uh. . . What? You've had feelings for me? Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had, you know? Chandler. When did he, when did he, when did he. China. Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha, and now, now, now you're over me? That's, that's Julie. Ju, Julie, Julie. Hi Julie. I'll be right down. Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, ya know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm, I'm gonna go get a cat. Cat. I didn't get a cat. No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. Then you should have said something before I met her. There was never a good time. Not, not, not every night. You know, and, and it's not like I didn't try Rachel but things got in the way, ya know, like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys. The point is I, I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it. Fine. Good. Try the bottom one. And, uh, and then I kissed her. Yeah. Hi. That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away? Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. How are you? Good. Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you? Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe? Play it. Ssshh. I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare. Can't we just use a pen? I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes. And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress. I don't know. She's not Rachel. Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing. Hi. I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's. No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing. Well, uh. Really. It's always been you, Rache. I know, I know, it's, it's almost...what do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them? Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat. Hey, someone order a coat? He won't, he won't. Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing? That's it? That's all you wrote? You are the worst writer in the whole world. No, you don't. Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok? Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot. No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rache? No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column. No, Rache, come on. Rache! Rache, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel? Rache! Whoops! Rache, hey, open up, please! I just wanna read something. It's your pro-list. Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben. Number six: the way you smell. Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window? I am, uh, I am... Rache, come on, open up. Rache, come on, come on, Rache. You got to give me another chance. No? rache, come on, look, I know how you must feel. No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things. You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you. Hi. Look, can, can you do something for me? Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi! Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it. Ok. Oh, you and me? Ok. As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married? Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding. No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me! Mmm hmmm. Uh-huh. This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television. Would it matter? I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married? If you wanna call that a reason. Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. Excellent! That is so good! Do it again! No no, that's me. Oh, hello. Is everything ok? Oh my god. Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Hi, Mrs. Green. And you had no idea they weren't getting along? No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. What's the matter? What? Carol, what's the matter? What happened? Oh my god. It's ok. I'm sorry. I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right. Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this. Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it. Any time. Yeah, can't help but. Ok. Yeah. No, that's fine. Ok. Well, Mon, I was married. That commercial always makes me so sad. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. Hey guys. Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel. Oh my God, what happened? I can't believe this. Well, ya know, someone should have called me. Zoo dollars? I was thinkin' about it. Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars? Buddy, my monkey? Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. That guy Lipson? No, I, I only know Lipson. Buddy, my monkey, my monkey. Of course. This is unbelievable. Are you trying to get me to bribe you? But you already told me everything. Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey. Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is. Well, there goes my whole belief system. That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin. Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin. Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan. I know. This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year. Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey? Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his.

I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big. OK, my hands were no where near your butt. No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious. Nuh, uh, the moment's gone. That's romantic. No. No. No. That was 14 hours ago. Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'? Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint? Hey. No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how? Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect. Hey. Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight. Look at that, they won't even turn their heads. Well, why're you all dressed up? What? You have a date? Who with? C'mon, what's his name? Come on, tell me. Oh, I promise, what. Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke?

Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect. Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner. KARL! Rach. I'm done. Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else. No, no, we won't. C'mon. Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape? OK, now, sit. OK. Sorry.

Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box. Hi. I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah. We're not alone. What? What's on your shoulder? A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi. No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me? I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.' Alright, shall we? Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here. Hi ma. Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us. Dad, you really don't want to do that. Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence. Mon, Mon, are you OK? Yeah. Eww. Ohh. Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal? I'll take that dad. You got a tattoo? Lemme see. Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow. Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff? Hey, save us some pizza. Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck. Get out. Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide. Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing. Wha-, you have a phone in here? Get the what? I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7. Calm down, I'm blow drying. All yours. I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain. Shut up. Mi-mi-mii. I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back. Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated. No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore. No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap? Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi. Did you see me write one down? Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby. Look, you wanna get off my back? Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend. OK. Uh, Eddie something. He just met him. I know. Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti. Wha-, oh, quit it. Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel. Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight. Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright. Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun. Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids. You hated me when we were kids? Why did you hate me? And that wasn't fun for you? I can't believe you hated me. Really? I can do that. So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight? What? Ohh... OK. What woman? What're you talkin' about? Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end? No no, you're fine, you're fine. Hi. Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened. Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it. I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour? Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen, I mean, I feel like- Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared. Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good. Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg. Buy mommy. Have a good time. Ok, Ben. Yeah. Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula. Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler. Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. Thank you. Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off. What're you doing? Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb. Well just hold him like you'd hold a football. Ok, here, here. There we go. It's alright, it's no big deal. Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. What? Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive. Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale. Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. Huh? Ok, what the hell happened back there? Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. C'mon, what, you never think about our future? No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good. The big book of childrens' names. Yeah. Ok fine. We're not done. Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that. Good, 'cause I love you. Yeah. Well that's the first time we've said that. Well, I'm gonna kiss you. Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail. Hello. Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. Wha, what? What, the word hi? Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything. Something about hi. Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him. Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys. Bye Ben. Alright, alright, ok. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview. On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh. Freakish. Oh yeah. Yeah alright. Oh, sorry we didn't know. Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee. Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat. Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler... It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore. Hi. What? Do you say this stuff to girls? You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door. Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat. Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that. Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. I know. Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that? Yeah. Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys. Thank you. Absolutely. How come it's not mixing with the water? No. No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. Yeah, sure. No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'. Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take? I think we proved our point. Cannot feel my tounge. Yes, and that's why we're here. Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon? Whad'ya mean? Before I forget, are we hitting faces? Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation. Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh. Hey. God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt. Yeah he was wasn't he. So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here? Alright. Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things? Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees? Yeah. I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come. Hi honey, how did it go? Thanks for being born. Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok. Really? All right. What? You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares. That's who. Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers? Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game? I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead. Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want? Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass. Cool. I know. Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse. Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister? No. no. No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir. All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time. Mine. Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals. Neil Sedaka wears them. Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you. Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip. I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing? Hiii. Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox. Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it. You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man. Ok, dinner's on. Alright you kids, bye now. Oh look, a low budget puppet show. So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board? Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines. Bye Ryan. You like that do ya? I'll make some calls. Is this what you had in mind? I'm shipping out tomorrow. Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs. Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it. Over my dead body! Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good. So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding. What's she look like? Get out! Get away from me I said no! Hey, there. Are you all right? Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride. Okay, good luck I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!' Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad. Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that... Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend. Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers. No, Rach! Marenge, Everybody! Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind. All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
