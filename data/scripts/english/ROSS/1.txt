Hi. I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. No I don't, to hell with her, she left me! No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know? I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again! Hi. You can see where he'd have trouble. Paul the Wine Guy, Paul? He finally asked you out? That'd be good... No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy! So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight? Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. Okay, sure. I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs. This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known. You guys. You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her... I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny. Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. You got a job? The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... No. No, I gotta go home sometime. Yeah. Mmm. Oh, no- No no no, go- Split it? Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? Okay... okay, maybe I will... Goodnight. I just grabbed a spoon. Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! Can I use.. either thumb? Easy. What is this?! Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. Hey, Pheebs. ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. ...What shoe? ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. You know what I like most about him, though? The way he makes me feel about myself. Well.. He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... What? Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. A thumb?! Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? If only he were a woman. Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. There y'go. Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? Hey, I might! Is there somebody else? Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were. Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. Yeah. He could row like a viking. So how'd it go? You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? Joey, uh- OMnipotent. I cannot sleep in a public place. It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. Why? Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth? Ohhh. Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. What are you doing? Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? You can totally, totally live on this. Oh, by the way, great service tonight. Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry. Peach pit. Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had- Actually, nectarines, but basically.. Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine. Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh. No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost... Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! Pass it! Pass it! Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. Hey, this- Heyy... I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. Look, it's just a little more complicated... Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... My first time with Carol was.. It was my first time. Hi. Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? The kid..? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever- -can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck. 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! GIVE ME MY PUCK!! ...Now that was fun. Okay, Monica: Right foot red. Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. Green. To the green. Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen. Is it? Feels like two. What? Oh. Hel-lo! He could never get a woman like that in a million years. C'mon! C'mon! No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is. Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey- Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask. Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy! Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away. Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice. Monica? You're Mom. C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part? You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again? No? What happened, big guy? It felt like a 'big guy' moment. Yeah, I mean- I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it- feel like your shot..? She is a kook. Alright!!!! And effciating at tonights blackout is Rabbi Tribbiani. That`s my sister. Hey Phebes, what about you? Er, Disneyland, 1989, it`s a small world after all. . . . Yeah, the er, ride broke down, er so Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children, and they, they fixed the ride and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom! Step back! Well it was the only thing to do there, that didn`t have a line. Come on. And you didn`t marry him be-cause? Probably. But, but, you know I`ll tell you something, passion is way over rated. It is, er eventually it kinds of burns out, but hopefully what you are left with is trust and security and er, well in the case of my ex-wife. . . . .lesbianism! So you know for all those people who miss out on that er, passion thing, there`s all that other good stuff. But er, I don`t think that`s gonna be you. . . . Umm, see I see, er, big. . . . . . passion in your future. Umm I do. What? Wha.Huh Hea. . . whadda..me, un, ra..wadda..uhtur. . . .why not?

Ok, here goes. I`m gonna do it. You come out there, your a dead man! Thanks! Ok?  Um,hey,I have a question, well er, actually it`s not so much a question as more of a general wondering....ment.

Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did. No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so... So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome. So, uh, how's she doing? Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants. She looks so small. Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. Bye, Nana. Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.. She's not- past, she's present, she's back. I, uh, I'll go see. Now she's passed. Twice. I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh... Nono, she's gone. I thought it was gonna be a closed casket. I don't see why not. Here's my retainer! This one? I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy. Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. Okay. Um, how about these? And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier? Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. Oh my God.. Yeah, just... just Nana stuff. How we doing, you guys ready? Some days it's all I can think about. What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...? Oh, I hope they're not ruined. I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...

That little naked guy would be me. Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now? Got me. Looks like a fun gang. Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. No, they're not. You're wrong. You're wrong. I'm calling Mom. Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? Well, I'm off to Carol's. Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. Hi, is uh, is Carol here? Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull, well, not mine, but... SUSAN: Come in. Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. Kinda like a big face without skin. Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're crazy? You're not serious, I mean, you really, you really talk to it? Do you uh, do you talk about me? Really? Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this. Oh, I hate this story. I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. That's closer. Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. Ok, Mom never hit. Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid. Hello, baby. Hello, hello. And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore. Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok? Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that? Does it always, uh--? Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts. Here we come, walkin' down the--this doesn't smell like Mom's. I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese. And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so... Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. Come here, Marcel. Sit here. Just a smidge. C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you? Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates. Four. Five. Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now. Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... Really. What, uh... what juggling thing? No. Par-tay! 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home? Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back. C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. Oh, please.. When did Rigatoni get back from Rome? Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew. What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place. Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. ...But a man can change. Anyone want me to appraise anything? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. No. It's the one he's licking. You're good. The girl on the cover with her nipples showing? When? The guy on the cover with his nipples showing? Please. Right. Uh-oh... Hey, is Chandler here? Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right? Okay. What code? Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept. No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one. Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum. I don't know, God, I- well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's- Well- not in the same way... Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here... Hey. Well, not playing raquetball! He didn't get the goggles! Do they wait for me to do this? Why would I tell him? Oh... You're my friend. I-I had to tell you. Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom. I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in- Thanks, man, big help. I wasn't- I mean, I- I know- Chandler- Chandler- Joey- I cannot believe we're having this conversation. Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a- Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips. Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something? We're rehearsing a Greek play. No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel? Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah! Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. You're kidding. Wow! 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say 'When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?'? So, what's going on now? Whaddya see? Mrs. Bing. You mean that? Yeah? How'd it go? Well, howdya feel? Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road. Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those! Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! Hello! Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now? ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration! Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna. Oh, that's great, that is great! Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis? Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh oh oh! No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't... Susan... Yes, we did, everything's A-OK! Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan... Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know! Wait--oh--hey--huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know! Hi Pheebs! I'm familiar with his work, yes... My God! The actress! Thanks Rach. You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. Come on, two on one. What, now? How's it going? Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed... ...and I really think it should be me. Hey. You all right? Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. What? Huh. Ohhhh See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo. I-I'm, I'm having a boy? Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy? I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy! I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy! I'm having a son. Um... I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident. And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword. Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class. No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team. No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation. I know. I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's. .. Who's next? Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend. Like buddies. You know how close women can get. Although I was married to her. Right. A little. Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch. It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink. Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote... Relax, I'll fix it. How did he do this? You ok? You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley? Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol? No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on. What? What? Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time. I see. So what do you propose to do? Flip me for it? No, no, no--heads, heads! Susan, go deep. Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right. I'm gonna be a father. I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me. Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid? Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt-- I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me. Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield. Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father. Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday? Tonight. You take your time. What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me. Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush. Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools. Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing? No, no, Dad, I was just wondering. Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father? No, we can go to Williamsburg. Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not. Hey. Well did you try calling her? Do you have a point? It's just a furball. Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney". I had a "k". Where's my "k"? You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a "k"! No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do. Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart! He looks so tiny. Yeah. The doctor got the "k" out. He also found an "m" and an "o". Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now. No, why? Aqui esta Y el caso es que no le gusta la tele Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here. Rach, did you proofread these? Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills. I don't know. No, it's not just that. It's just--I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... What? Who? Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii! We're fine, we're fine. Uhhhh... Joey cried last night. Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.' No, women are welcome to play. Excuse me, do any of you know how to play? No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't--you can't do-- Oh, you're... Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy... The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game. Well that's fine with me. Could use the money. ...Yeah. Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... I'm not a nice guy. Alright boys, let's eat. You still on that? You are way off, pal. Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time--not any more. I just--I-- Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK--if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. Alright. I'm gonna pay for that tonight. Hey. Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those? Alright. So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing. Uh... to the bathroom. I want to go to the bathroom. Alright. : Your money's mine, Green. Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. Oh, I am very in. No, not this time. So... what'd you have? Come on, show them to me. Show them to me! Let me see! Show them! First of all, I'm not losing... Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the-- Mee mee, mee-mee mee. I'm in for fifty cents. I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit. No, I fold. I'm in. One. I bet two dollars. I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. : Joey, I'm a little shy. Fifteen. Thank you. : OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got? You got me. Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is. Uh.... bean! Bean! Marcel, bring me the rice! Come on! Bring me the rice! Come on! Good boy! Good boy! Come on, give me the rice!.... Thank you. Good boy! Ah I see he's finally mastered the difference between "bring me the" and "pee in the".... "Bring me the" and... Rache? Hi! Mmm. Really? Whoa. What, er, what happened to, er, "forget relationships", "I'm done with men", the whole, er, penis embargo? Mmm. Mmm. Right, right. I, I got it. I was there. Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Yes! I do! I really do! Er, in fact, it's funny. Very often, someone who you wouldn't think could, could, curl your toes, might just be the one who, er, who... ...gets interrupted! Hi! Alright. I've gotta go. Come on Marcel, come on. Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes we are! That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you? Huh? Pwease Aunt Monica, Pwease! Oh. Unclench. You're not even gonna be here! I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me. Well, I added the "exactly like me" part, but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. Well, I think it's perfect, you know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she's spent all day taking care of my monkey... Anyway, you know, I figured after work, I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there, and, er, try to woo her. Hi. Hey, how did it go today? Yeah, yeah. You, er, you want some? Er... OK... Yeah. We can do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North East, I was, er, kinda wanted to run something by you... You know how we were, er, you know, talking before, about, er, relationships and stuff, well... OK. Quick and painful. No, why? What, what? Yeah? I, I, I can't, I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment. No, no. You know what? I guess it's partially my fault, you know, I shouldn't have asked you to, er, start off with a monkey. I should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil. You've called Animal Control? Huh! Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me... That's right, cos I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! Yeah. We, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't. Cat! My uncle Marcel... Marcel! Marcel! Ah, this is ridiculous. We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone. He's, he's just gone. Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the village... ... And now I have a broken foot! Thank you very much! Yeah. Yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign, hey, I don't miss Marcel any more! No, no, no. No, no. This is just vintage "Rachel". I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in "Rachel Land", doing your "Rachel Thing", totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to peoples feelings, and you... I don't even want to hear it... No you're always... Oh, forget it, OK? What, what, what? Hey! Bananaman! Hi! Did you order some bananas? Give me my monkey back! Marcel? Marcel? OK. Where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel! What have you done to him? Are you insane? Come here Marcel, come on. Come here Marcel. OK. Give me my monkey back! Alright. I want my monkey! You had to be a bitch in high school. You couldn't have been fat! Hey, It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it... or we can leave it on for now. That's fine... Listen. I'm... I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, you know, I just... No, no. Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, you know, you, you, you were great... Hey, we, er, we still have that, er, that bottle of wine... You in the mood for something grape? Alright. Er (Gets wine, glasses, and turns down the lights...... The, er, the neighbours must be vacuuming! Well, er, so long as we're here, and, er, not on the subject, erm, I was thinking about, er, how mad we got at each other... before... and, erm, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, er, how we... !... We have got to start locking that door! I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel- What? It's, it's just a phase. Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. What? Hi. At the vet. She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. I'm gonna have to give him up. I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg. No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo. Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer. Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him? Where exactly is your zoo? Yes. Nono, he's, he's very docile. Well I, I don't know. Why? He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... Why- why- why would he need a blade? He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. Just, just say what you feel. That was good. Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him. Why, why, why would you dream that? I love it, when we share. I can't belive you two had sex in her dream. Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press? Oh, it's my new beeper. No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO. College? Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time. Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr' is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services. Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye. Oh, oh Chandler... 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.' Okay, Andr' should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way. Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there. You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything? Huh! Are you not seeing him anymore? Oh, yeah. It's morphin time! Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it. Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. I thought that was just a rumour. Are you're hands still wet? I'm here. What? Great, now I'm having a baby. Ooh, Ooh. I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone? I'm hurt. Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor. Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. What are you doing? We're going to a hospital. Joey, get out of the fridge. What is that? Save it. Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming. That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on. I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucous plug. God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab. She's not even here yet. Where the hell have you been? Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys. Stopped for a chunky. No. Dr. Franzblau, hi. 59 seconds. Quartz, ha. I'll get it. I got it--I'm getting it! Yeah. I'm paying you to stop. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12... Who the hell is Jordie? No no no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie, we just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco. I got it. I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. Why? No, you started it. But-- Thanks a lot. Yeah, listen-- Please. This is so your fault. Look, Carol never threw me out of her room before you came along. You tryin' to be clever? Oh, I'm threatened by you? Yeah, Susan. I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow. Help! Help! Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be like the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok, where does that leave me? Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. You wanna explain that? Ok, got the vent open. Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben. Pheebs, It's open! It's open! We're here! Long story, honey. Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this? Oh, sorry. We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person. Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jello. Oh, thanks, Pheebs! How 'bout Ben? We uh, we just cooked it up. Hey. I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody. The head, the head. You gotta... Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. No, this is pretty much it. All right, I'll see you guys later. And here's little Ben nodding off... That would be nice. What kind of research? Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. Hey. Hey. I'm going to China. Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's-- it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me... : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me? Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. Oh. Hey, who's Carl? No. At the coffeehouse, right. OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys. Hi. ....I have to go to China. No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is? Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight. Yeah... I guess. I don't--I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? I know.  Ni-chou chi-ma! I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. Fine, just stop thinking about me. Can't do it, can you? I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway? Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. I know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up? No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? Well, start looking. Oh, hey, hey, I got that. No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends. Yeah. No, no, they will. I just... uh... Come on, they're gonna love you.
