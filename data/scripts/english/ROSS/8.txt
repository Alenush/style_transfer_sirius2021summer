Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you! Monica’s pregnant! What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant? No! I’ll be right back. Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother. Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name. Aw come on, Mona Lisa? Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world. Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too. Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken. Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six. Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… Hello. It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… Hi. Umm, would you like to dance? Yeah? Oh great! I wasn’t farting! Uh, a little game from our table. Yes? Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady. Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first. Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet. Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking? Keep dancing. No-no, thank you Miranda. All right. Oh-oh, were you, were you watching? What? Of course you can! Hop on! I am so gonna score. I like your bow. That was very nice Ashley. No-no. Oh! Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name. That’s, that’s pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert? Okay. Hop on Gert. I’m trying. Maybe I should stand on your feet! I just didn’t see the fast song coming. Oh, thank you. Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! Hi. Why not? It’s built into the price of the room. Thread! What disposable cameras? No you didn’t. Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that. No. Sorry man. Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them. In-in three minutes. Chandler? No. Did you? Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them. Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed? I’m sorry man. Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people. No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces. I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down? I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers? What about the chairs? How about the place settings? What did you do? Hmm. I heard it. I heard it. Okay. Okay! Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed. A ’95 LeSabre?! A green LeSabre? I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre. Well go! Go move it! Yeah. Now you are going to love these. Huh, didn’t see that coming. Well, I’m gonna go get these in some water. No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month! Hey! How you doing? Yeah. Oh hey, right back at ya. Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady? Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later. He is so weird. Hey! No why? Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later. Oh no. I think I might know what this is about. Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together. Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked. Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again. Why? What-what else could it be? I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you? Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. Hi. I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? Look uh, I know why you’re here. Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first. Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it? I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends? Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now. Oh sure. I’m good. I’m good. Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom. What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!! No they don’t!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!! Oh well I may as well have! Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer! No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company! Shh! Shh! Shh! Yeah I’ll press 1! Hi. Sure. Namaste. Oh my God! What happened to the door?! Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her. Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. Rachel’s pregnant. With my child. You already know don’t you? Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well. Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone. But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective. I gotta go find her. Evidently they do. Hi! Uh we-we need to talk. Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today. What? Oh yeah. I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really—I should have been thinking about you Rach… Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married. Well yeah, I think we should get married. No, because that’s the right thing to do. No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone. Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant. I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself? When have you ever? Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup! I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!! But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone. I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me. Oh my God. Thank you. Pretty amazing huh? What? What?! You-you just said that you did! Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there . Do you really? Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut? Sweetie that’s it. You’re welcome. Yeah, that’s our baby. Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus. Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her. Hello! So, how was the honeymoon? Yeah, thanks. Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading. The lie you just told. There’s the one! Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who. What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place! Yeah! Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened! Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it. I can show you, I have it on videotape! It’s an expression. Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door! Okay, listen I am not a pervert! Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. About…about sex? That I hadn’t had sex in months? Hey! Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about. I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise. Five to be lying, six. Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky. Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health! Really? Well then tell it to me. I’ll try to control myself. You were backpacking across Western Europe? Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and? Why? It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking… Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo… Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?! Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks! No! No, I don’t…don’t want to. I was backpacking across Western Europe. I was just outside Barcelona, hiking… It’s been six months! I’m always hot! I’ll try that. Thanks. Thanks. And-and hey Joe? Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out. Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel! Hi! That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was. So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything. What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me! Thank you. No! Joey! No! Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. Forget it, she’s destroying it. Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story. What?! I don’t want people to see it for your sake. Rachel, please… Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying… Hello! Can I get you anything? You didn’t do it? Not on the ones we sent out. I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost… I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to. So we…we both wanted to. Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best. And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why. Now I’m so happy. Hi. Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve. It was. It was an amazing night. I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it. Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird. Good luck. Mind if I mute? Oh, oh there go the clothes. Six months Rachel, six months. Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good. Oh nice tan! Ah…. I have been working out. Oh that’s not pretty. No! Oh no! Oh no!! No!! No!!! Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long. Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go. Yeah! Yeah!! I’m telling you, I like the food! Did that guy just call you Toby? Well, why don’t you correct him? Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him! Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!! Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they? Hey! So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested? Rach? You wanna come? A date? Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull. A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who? You set her up?! Joey what-what were you thinking?! Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them? A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?! Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!! Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight. A bit of a daredevil are we? Okay. Have a great time you guys. Yes it is too slutty! Books? Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang. Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no. I just…I have to find out how it went. This guy could be my baby’s stepfather! I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?! I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening. It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section. No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away. It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though. No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were? No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now. Yeah. We can still catch that Ukrainian film. Hello. Well, how was the date? Uh-huh. What happened? Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well? Oh? He sounds swell. Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up? Sit down. Guess whose middle name is Muriel. Yeah-ha! I’m sorry about your date. Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea. You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee? Hey, I thought I cheered you up. Right. Good night. Yeah? Oh hi! Wow! Uh…how are you? Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film? Great! Well umm… Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
