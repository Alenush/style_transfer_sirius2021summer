I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison. Hey Mon! Nope. Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so. Getting it away from me would be job one. You need to get some sleep. Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her. Hmm? Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place. I think I have an old band uniform from high school. Yeah. What? No. Nope. What? Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi? Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool. Hey! Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter. Okay. Hi. Guess what? They published my paper. How could you have told her? Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal. Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us. That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'. Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her. Noo! Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything? Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times? I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think. Women tell each other everything. Did you know that? No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.... Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna? Nooo! Yeah? Okay, okay, I'll go first. So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing.... Yes! Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go. Okay. Hmph. With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa! Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you? I said '*share*' not '*scare*'. Go sit over there! . No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. Hey! Why aren't you guys dressed? No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight. Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now. Really. Hi. 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man. No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done. Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes. No! Do you wanna hear it? Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey. Hey! Wow, hello! You look great! You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star. You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So.. That's, that's funny. Change! Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late. Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts. "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!" Nevermind. It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep? Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did? I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go. No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out humus?! What gets out humus?! Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes. Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing. Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab. You don't, you don't know what your wearing? Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you. Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty. Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep. Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing? What? Hey, what you do on your own time... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear? Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now? Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight? Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!! Just, just, just pick one! Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay. No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go. Thank you! It was, it was her voice. Yay! No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick. Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um. You're not going to go. How, how, um how can you not be going? Um, you know, just out of curiosity... Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled. No, but, your-your mad. No. Your not going. Okay. You know that I-I have to go. Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.' No, because your not upset. About the yelling. Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay. We're good. Okay. Honey? I love you. Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party! You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there. Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation. What? Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do. I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. You will?! Well, yeah. How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica! Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go! Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow! So we're a little late. What? Awwww!!! Wow! What a pleasure. Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning? Aww, is it broken? Mon? Wait a minute, look. Look, look, look. It's an empty apartment. We're all alone in an empty apartment. There it is. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter? And it works both ways. Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do? Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her. Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you. Bye sweetie. Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do. Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed... I'm gonna use the cushion. Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you. Yep. Shoot. Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker. What are you talking about? What? Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad! Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna..... I'm gonna tell Mom. Crazy. Oh, it's not the ideal way... How's the maniac? You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles? Hello. Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second? Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! Are you intrigued? There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi? Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again? You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I. Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata? You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you. Where there is no fear of commitment. Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi. Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas! You'll never get me, Joe!!! Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose. Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.' What? What are you talking about? Okay, you are totally making this up. Oh God. There was no song. There was no song! Okay. Okay, that's, that's enough. Won't you dance around with me. Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities. Spiderman? Thank you. Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories.... Hey. Okay, I've got three of my five. Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with. Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left. Okay, Elizabeth Hurely.... Susan Sarandon. And!! Isabella Rosselini. Hey! Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final. Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer. That would be me. Hey, it's my list. Okay!! Okay!! Heavy thing, not getting lighter! Thank you. Isabella Rosselini. Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list. Yeah, maybe. What you don't think I'd go up to her? Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. Okay, hold my crawler. Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one? Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery. Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... Um, yeah. Um, no. But, okay. Um, see, but that's not the final draft. Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local. What? We're just gonna be friends. I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us. Yeah, I’ll take some. What? Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore. Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now. Hey. So how many more do you have tomorrow? Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices. I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo... Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately. Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye I don’t know, something girlie. Hi. Where is everybody? My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over. ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation. I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool! Well, now I do!! Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever.... Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this! Thanks. Thanks. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. My foot is stuck in the pocket. No, I can’t get it out. No, come on don’t start. Ouch! Stupid balls are in the way. Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution. Huh? My wife’s a lesbian. Hi. So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out..... Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie. We? Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry. Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'. Fine. Hi Gunther. What? Come on! That's great. Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students. Nice to see you again Dr. Green. Ugh, museum. There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one. Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke. It's not a library... So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat. It gives it a nice antiquey look. Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. Okay! Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent. That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress. So? You really serve people sneezers? Thanks again, Dr. Green. Oh, ah, you don't need that. The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness. Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really. I know. Nothing I do means anything, really. Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'. Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food. Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work. Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!' Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along. Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels. Dr. Green. How are you? Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore. Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go. Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that.... Thank you! That's what I keep saying. Uh. And his first name. Oh-ho please. Ask her how? Argue with that. I know that! What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either. Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice? Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see? Excellent! Neither will I. So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one. Why? Why can't you go to him? Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence. Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too? No, no he's not. What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler? Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display. Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that. Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you. You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. Yeah. Hmm? Joey, Homo Sapiens are people. Hey! Everyone. How's my little boy? What'd you do, take him whaling? Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben. And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving. Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head? It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could. I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time. Monica did it? Monica? Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today? Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head. Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know... Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow! Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance! He does not look happy. Halftime. What? Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football. It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running. Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking. Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup? Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake. Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again. Can I see you for a second? All right, we're gonna play. Here you go. Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler. Sweetie, now I pick you. Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off. Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on! Come on, let's go! Yeah, losers talk! Yeah! Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break! You, you go long. Until we start to look very small. Break!! One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!! Uh, hello, it's third down. Wow! It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this. Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need. Well, I said it loud. Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie.. Well ah, you wanna just stay out there? Yeah. Okay. Hut! Hike! Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count. Before the snap! Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count. Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater. Oh-ho, okay. Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win. Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!! Oh really! Why is that? The Geller Cup. Okay, where in the hell did you get that?! That cup is mine! Chandler! Chandler! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling? Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough. Hey, where'd you get that? It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team. What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns. Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me. Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go. Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys. Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like? Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill... Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls. Hey! It's 42-21! Let go! Let go! No! You let go! How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball? Hey! It's starting to snow. Gimme the this! Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand. Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand. All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache. I know. I feel horrible. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like? All right, see you guys. So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore. Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India. Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? Yeah. Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes? And what is second prize? Well, that makes sense. Yeah, Sarah, anything. Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies. No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs. No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world. Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going. All right!! ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus. Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you? No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night. Mon? Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's. Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em. I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free. Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em! ....and 12, 22, 18, four... What? Ah, we're out. I sold them all. Monica, I'm cutting you off. Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck. Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes! Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!' Well hey, who did these resumes for ya? Well you sure used a large font. Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay. What, that wasn't the great news? Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell? Hey now! That was an accident, okay. What's a scrud? I don't have too. I can just look at you. Not nice enough. Good for a scrud. That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going. Hi there! Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency. Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes. Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out. That word was swans. No. I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!! Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown! Oh no! An asteroid! Real magic does exist. Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling. Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then. Oh, somebody's feeling better. Hi! Wow! What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason? And he's, he's a total stranger? Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex. Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason. Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason? Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me? Uh-huh. Hi. Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today. Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy. That's excellent. So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him? Yeah. You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!! Which one is Gina? That's okay. Hey, Joey. Ah, which, which one? Mary-Angela. Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. Where in Cuba? Bummer. No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you. But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy. What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home? That's right good things, that-that is what I said. That is so made up! There you go. Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less. High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro. You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way? 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend! Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal. No. Well, yeah! You grow up. Hi! Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... Hi. How'd did it go? I'm so proud of you. Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so... Yeah. Congradu!! -lations-lations. Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it? Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too? Ah, we'll all go. Come on. It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! Why? Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. Hmm? Oh, yeah. Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch? Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? What?

Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me. Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.

What should I wear, now I'm all nervous. I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you. So I nodded off a little. Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses. First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly. Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka. No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it. That's a little clearer. Sure, I-I-I... Is everything okay? Hey. What is ah, Rach in her room? Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary? What's that on the bottom? Hey, honey.

Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week. Yeah, but wait... Hey. No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed. For what? For letting you throw me out of your office? Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel. No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job! Yes. No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore. Is this about Mark? Okay, it's not, it's not. Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do. Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.. Oh, hi Chloe. Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead. What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up. Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while? Hi! It's me. Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this? Who's that? Is that Mark? Yeah! Got it! Ah, that's okay, thanks. Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay? I like this song. Oh, no, no.

Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. Yes, you can, very much. Ahhhh!! You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did. What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other? Yeah, but don’t you think.... Yeah, okay. What trail? Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail. Chloe? Hi.. You took my watch? Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right? You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met... Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend. Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her. Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself? Actually, no, we’re not. No, we’re not. No, we’re not!! Right. Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister. Jasmine? We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller. Yes, I did. Very bad. I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet? Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay? Thank you, thank you. Who’s your roommate? Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place. Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!! Rachel? No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay? No!! No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this. What? She was... She, she was different. Nobody likes change. What? Okay, okay, okay, okay. I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible. Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me! Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up. That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up. Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead! Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen! Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to. Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark? Yes I would. Yes. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you. What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking? Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’ Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself. No anchovies. That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off. You can have the last piece, if you want. What, now you’re not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey! Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough! That’s what?! Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much. Okay, okay, okay. What? Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together... Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and.... Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean. Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks. Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it’ll be great! No, no, no, this weekend guys! What’s going on? So, for the whole weekend? Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand. What a pity stay? Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays. Hey. Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home? Where’s Ben? Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time? Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January? Ah! Oh. Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up. Yeah, well. Oh yeah, I’d love that. I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan. 717? Where’s 717? Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right? Pheebs? What, why are you whispering? Oh, now you want a favour? Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay? No, I’m not gonna pick them up. No, Rachel doesn’t want me to.... Yeah, you’re right. We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were.. ., yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk. He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate. Excuse me? Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin? Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills. All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready. You’re welcome. We were on a break! Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me. That’s what you said last night. Okay. Obviously not to Joey. Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no. I can. Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go. No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise. Okay. Okay. That would be great. I know! Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping? Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp. Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110? Okay. So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know? So I’m gonna take off then! Pffhah. Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap. Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay. Here you go. Sorry. Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party. And so now you guys are gonna be married? Pheebs, what, is it the age thing? Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself. All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything. Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that. No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel. No, I ah, I slept with someone else. It didn’t. Yeah, yeah. Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it! Oh, no! No! I’m the ring bearer. Hi! Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire? Still?! I guess he musta gotten the part in that play. Hello. So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.

Hey guys! Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign. He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name. Yeah, that'd be cool! Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!

Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again. Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry. Okay, we’ll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? Well, this is ironic.
