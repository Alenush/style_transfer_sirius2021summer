Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! Why are we in bed together? Yeah. No! But we-we didn’t have sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur. And we didn’t have sex. Tell me about it. Hey! What? Yeah! What?! Hello! We didn’t get married. We-we-we....I remember being in a chapel. I....They would not let us get married when we were that drunk! Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment. What? No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced! Hey! Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing? I’m not going to do that. Yes, exactly! Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more. I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy! Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it! I’m asking you to do me a favor. And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. Hey! Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents! I don’t know if it’s true. Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage... All right. All right, I’ll do it. Hey! Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of. Oh yeah, why not? Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird? I didn’t get the annulment. We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. Hey! Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of. Oh yeah, why not? Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird? I didn’t get the annulment. We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. Hey, do you have any gum? I know. Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces. Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage! Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please? Hey! Hi! What’s up? Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great. Bye. Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs! No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists. Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times? What?! Why? And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. ....once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault. What?! This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here? We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol! Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times. Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth......Nothing!! Yes. Yes, second in two years. Third overall. Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk! Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her. This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled. I think just the annulment for today. Easy. No problem. Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy. Oh no. I couldn’t. It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I.... I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her? I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! Ohh, what’s wrong?! Oh my...Come here! Come here! It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay. Of course. Hey! Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well. No. I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend. It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug. It’s also a sign of friendship. It was a hug! S-s-smell her hair? What if I did? I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts! If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place! Hey! Rach, uh, you still looking for a place? Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested? Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here’s Warren’s number. Okay, you go grab it! I don’t know what you’re talking about. Look, I do not re-love her. Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid? You can live with me. What? Uh-huh. Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out. Hero, I uh, I don’t know...well, all right. Oh please! You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya? Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff. What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right? What?! Over a stupid room! Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great! What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly! Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness! Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right? And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya? Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! Hey Rach! You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right? I mean for them. Right? Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird? No! No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place? Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates. Really?! We are? Ohh! That would be great. Yeah, I didn’t think of that. So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?! No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up! Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!! Fine! It’s your life! I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do. DON’T DO IT!!!!! So umm, where are the other guys? Fighting?! Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there? Sure! Here. Yeah, I’m-I’m sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. I’ve been back and forth. Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys. Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right. Is that what I want? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey! How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen. You complete me kitchen, matey! What? Oh, my, God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel! Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her! Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello? No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U! Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it. I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller." Hey everyone! Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind? "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..." "...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..." No! Why? Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..." Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club! Okay! Thank you! Please don’t say naked chicks. I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks. Hello! It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either! I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler. That’s right! Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when Oh bloody hell. Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out. Will you-will you please? Oh. I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister. Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing? Just please stop! Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do? They’re not listening too me? Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing? All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes. Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression... Well, hello Rachel! Look I was going to tell you! Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage. Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it. Phoebe, I told her you already knew. Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything. Okay Rach, but... Look I told you... Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand! What about the time I said we were on a break? Fine, I’m mentally unstable. What?! Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug! Oh, come on! Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now! And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies! That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form! And what... ...What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!! Yeah! My fault?! You threatened the judge! That was the only way I could get him to stop typing! The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign. Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay? Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married! Yeah! Right! You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right? What? Okay, can we just sign please? Congratulations. What? Excuse me? Yeah? So then if-if, I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault. I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you. Did I, did I even treat? That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office. Eh, no problem. Totally. Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! Oh, but-but I can’t do it. Because, because I’ve got Ben. Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? I gotta go make a fake Ben. Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Hello? Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right...Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack. And now you want that money back. Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. No. So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and- and live forever as a machine. Hi! So uh, wha-uh, what do you do? Thank you for bringing her into our lives. Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then- then I can't date her. Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed. Yeah. Hey! Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin? Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff? Put it back exactly where you found it? ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping. Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica? Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me. Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you. Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there. Yeah that-that, doesn't look right. Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. Hey, I've been married 3 times Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue. Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science. Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. I'm never gonna find love again. Who cares? I repel women. What?! Why does anyone have to be naked? I-I had to show Chandler something? Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem. Dude, what'd you have? The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures. So really, what'd ya have? Bye! So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing. Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary? The one that always stares at me when I come in? Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don’t you set us up? Maybe it’s a universal thing? Hey guys. What’s up? I whitened them. Yeah. What do you think. Come on, seriously. Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to. A-A day. I know. That’s why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad? Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour. Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore. But, won’t she notice I have makeup on? What?? No. I am not putting on makeup. Mmm-Hmm. Mmm. Mm-Hmm. Hmm-Hmm. Mmm-Unmm. Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm. Mmm. Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm. Hmm-Hmm. Mmm-Hmm. How about all the way. Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we? Ohh, you can see them, huh? I-I, did that for you. What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999! Yes, of course they like you! Yeah, they don’t like you. I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh- No I don’t want to play video games, Joey! For real? Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that. And the place looks so nice! Happy Thanksgiving! See ya! Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having. Some would say she’s attractive, yes. Dude, we were good! Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner. Yeah, yeah, what is it? W-What was the one right before bananas? Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way! Oh my God, the pages are stuck together! Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie! No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up. Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story! Dude, I need to talk to you a sec. Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you. Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter. How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister? I don’t know, I-I was all high. Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was? Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it? Okay, fine! Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay. What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day! Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way no one makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potato Pie! Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second? So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? And um...You look nice today. What? Eh? You’re alone. Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying! Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left. It tastes like feet! Are you kidding? Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter. Wha-what? You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana? Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry. Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did! Monica and Chandler are living together! I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things! Hey Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or? ...and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago. I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS! Hi Janine! You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most! Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that. Are you serious? Bye Janine! It was a dry day. Oh my God! Got it! Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it! Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air? Right. No biggie. Stay loose. Why do they keep doing that? Right. Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there? Yeah! We know! Okay. Monica! Would it? Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform! The routine! Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform! We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice? So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next? Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment! No! Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe going into the robot, y’know? I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then. Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it! Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures. Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too. What? Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did. Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’ What? Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right? No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you. It’s my joke. You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard. What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey. Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a cheque for one hundred ah-dollars. Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer. Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? Well, I’m not going to go now anyway . Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out. Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man. Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee? Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it. Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee? It’s my joke. Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this. Yeah! Hey Mon. Monica! Yeah. Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world. We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth....me. See, I would never snap at you like that. Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey! It’s your joke. No way. Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free? Hey does anyone have any gum? Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good! Hey! When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine. Hi Jill. Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card. I don’t think charging new clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own. Sorry-sorry Jill. Huh? Oh, I got this.... ...this! Yeah! Oh, I-I love these babies! Ross, wants a Pashmina? It’s a rug. Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. Well. Hey! Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I’m sorry!" Oh stop. No, you stop! Rach? Hi! Did you tell your sister to ask me out? Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never! Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!" I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just... y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing. Hi Jill! Hi . Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here. Okay. So well I’ll umm, I’ll have her home by midnight. Hey! Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun. I guess so. No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils. Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe. Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again? Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean. Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again. I mean after tomorrow night. Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore. You want me to call her right now? Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester! Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she? And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. Yeah! Good for you Joe! You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me. Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter? Of course, what happened? Okay, umm. What? Wow! Really?! Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes! Ohh! Slides are almost ready. Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen. Hello? O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking. So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show! Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me. You uh, you may have been right about Jill. Umm, she kissed me. Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay? Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking. Oh wait, hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing. Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us! No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector. You’re welcome. You take care Jill. I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced. The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian. I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical. No, I just think Monica was that fat. What?! Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out? Oh my God! Rachel Green? No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross! No, no-no, Ross Geller. Yeah. Right. Good-good, I’m-I’m married. Is-isn’t it the best? Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi. Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited! Come on! No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t... Okay. Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let’s go see Monica! Hey Mon! Mon, look who I ran into! And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. And that’s Phoebe over there! 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual. Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I’ll play you one of my other... Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime! Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks. Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay. Yeah. Well, last weekend... ...will be two months. ...since I stopped trying. What-what do you mean? Oh. Wow! Okay, I think I got it. So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there. Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little. Carol our sex life is...it’s just not working. Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!! Yay! Seriously, our sex life. I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun? Well I don’t know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome. Come on. I got it. I got it! Hello? No she can’t come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better. Yeah, she’s fired. So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find. Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone’s been doing their homework. Oh, I know. Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda. Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep. Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. Hey, Pheebs! Hey, how’s it going? She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she? Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job. We’re really gonna do this, huh? Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at... Okay. I’m-I’m Ross by the way. How hot is this?! Hey! Look at you! You’re up! Hey Joe did...Did you ever have a threesome? No! The reason I’m asking is that... I sorta had one last night. Yeah! Yeah! It was, it was okay. Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?" Oh-oh, absolutely! It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around. Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol. No, she kept kicking me away! No! Oh I a lot of stuff! A little. Yeah. I made a snack. Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard. It really was! Hey Rachel. Umm, no. That-that’s always good news. Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. We’re sorry. Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s? Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that. Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym! Men. I guy I know. She is not... She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this. I’m sorry your husband cheated on you. Try telling my wife that. Hey, remember when I had a monkey? Yeah, what, what was I thinking? What’s up with the greed Joe? Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here? Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job! Hi! Hey, what have you guys been up to? Wow! After one class? I don’t think so. Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call unagi. No, it’s a concept! All right, maybe it means that too. Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care! Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you! All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a surprise!! All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. Y’know what... No. So what are you gonna do? DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!! A lesson in the importance of unagi. Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass? I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I... look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi. Chandler. I sensed it was you. Unagi. I’m always aware. What’s up? Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes. Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade. Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. Why not? Oh. It’s not something you are! It’s something you have! Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt! It’s a great class. Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next? No. No-no. No. What would you do next? Yes that’s right. I tired attacking two women, did not work. No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them. Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no. Ah-ha, nowhere to run! DANGER!!!! Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!" Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous. Yeah. It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou... it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student. No, but it is frowned upon. Besides, there’s a big age difference. I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference. Yeah? Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow! That was you? Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea. What time? Gotcha. Oh! So-so seriously, what time? What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson. Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt. Umm, no. No. Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty. Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all. Burt! We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people! Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou. Yeah. What-what should I do? Going out with who? Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh... What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink? Oh, you have some studying to do? Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to... Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you! What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone? What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth. That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore. What? Really? Its not just frowned upon? Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other. I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden. What? Really? Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong. No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo. Let’s also get a hot plate! Hey everybody! Hey uh, this is Elizabeth. Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. Bye. Oh that is quite all right ma’am. Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow. Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on! I don’t know Rachel, why? Well thanks! Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now. Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are... Hmm? Oh, a student I don’t know. Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding? Shh! Of course, why don’t we go inside? Oh-ooh! Doorknob! Doorknob! Oh, okay. What-what about? Spring vacation. Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger I’ll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her? I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset? What the hell are you doing? What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?! Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while. Do not give him any money! Yes. Yes! Please, come in. Oo-oo! Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. Look, I... Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon. No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was.... That! Let’s talk about that. Hey! Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation. What’s-what’s the difference? Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that. I went to Egypt with my dad. Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she’s taken my class! I’m gonna call her. Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know... Okay, she can’t go. Then what am I supposed to do? Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys? I’m so glad you’re going on this trip! Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam. Are you into crafts at all? Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what’s this? To wear in front of people? Is this?! So uh, have a great time down there. Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit? It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure. Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk. Really? Okay. Cool. Call me! Excuse me? You're right, you're right, it is. So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? It’s your turn. Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well? Totally! Great! Wow! Oh, I love that guy! What am I doing? Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine. Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. Oh my God! You ate my sandwich? Oh-oh really? What? You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! MY SANDWICH?!!! MY SANDWICH!!!!!! What? What? Yes, yes it is. In prison! It took two people to break up this relationship!! I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter! I fell asleep! It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’ FINE BY ME!! That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, when you’re dead! There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac... Oh my God. I mean... Totally. Hey! What are you guys doing later? I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me. Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good. Thanks! It-it’s great to meet you Paul. Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens. Eh-wh...Excuse me? That’s funny. Umm... It’s not funny. Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind. What? This is...you... Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student...I mean I not...not it! I mean, I mean I don’t. We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke....lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish. And the Irish guy wins the joke! Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler. Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees. Yeah, why don’t you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about. Joey?! Joey?! Joey!! Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here! Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you! What-what-what the...how da-how did-what the-how did-what?! In your mouth?! You were at the coffeehouse! He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird! That was different! This is weird for me! How is that important? Yeah, take your time. Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as... Not all bad. Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too. No! No! Not...I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby. Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! Oh, I’m sorry! It’s unbelievable! You’re back. Y’know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly... God no! Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! Still not yelling! That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either. Uh yeah, I guess... Yeah! I guess so. Ohhh! Kids! That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now. Hey! Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town. Yeah. Why? What? No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh? Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need... he’s got like a hearing aid y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and... Really? That okay, that’s great. All right look, I-I realize it upsets you. But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it. Ohh! A man with a plan! This place is really beautiful! Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes. Do-do ou want to make out? Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father. No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before. Yeah. Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot. Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it. No. A little bit. Okay. Ohh, okay. What are you doing here?! Yeah, I recognize the ankles! You and your ice. Did you really hear a bear? Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I’m gonna go out this window. I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay? And that is why we cannot see each other anymore. Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain. All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. And I too am just a love machine. Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go. How rude. Hi! Great to see you! How you doing? Okay! You take care! Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before? Phoebe, why’d you do it? What?! Why?! I can’t think of anything. Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago? I guess it could. Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth. Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday? Remember? You-you were eating pizza. Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago. Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him. Oh. All the time? Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets? What?! I can’t believe it. Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now. Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all! That’s right! Eh? We’ll show him! Wait a minute, is this, is this for real? So you two are really serious?! You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean... We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! Hey-hey Pheebs! Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him! You told her before you told us? God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever! Yeah, you didn’t get one. Hey! Hey! Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth. I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp...to be a counselor! I don’t know. Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way? Uh-uh... Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you! Yeah, yeah you have the ring? Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here! What’s-what’s going on? Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building! Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same. No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second? Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh.... Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!! Oh my God, you guys!! Who? What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too. Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight. Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do. Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is. Hmm. Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and... No! No! I... didn’t do that. It’s just... Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her. I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part. Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake? Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about... What?! Okay, break-up’s still on! What happened you guys? Rach! Hey, come on in. Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be. I guess so. Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup. Ohh, yeah I already have one. Phoebe. Ohh, I don’t think so. That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that. Hey! Phoebe, how could you do this to me?! I was not! No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid! Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too! All right.
