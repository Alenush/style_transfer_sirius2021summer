Hi! Awww. Yeah. I know. Okay, I gotta go. Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie. Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff. No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her... Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that? Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning. Okay. It's over. Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left. Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby. Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting. Oh. Oh-oh. Done! Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice! I'm sorry. Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance. No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does. Oh, sure! I'm sure. Hey! What happened? It does. It really and truly does. It so does not!!! She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!! Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, If you accept full responsibility... Full responsibility! ...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!! Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this. What the hell happened on that beach?! Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing? What happened? Joey? Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?! I missed you too. I suppose. Umm-hmm. WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!! And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!! I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter! I fell asleep! It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!' FINE BY ME!! Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!! Who's Chip? The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you? Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!! I was just leaving. Why? Did you write it? Well ah, actually... Well, umm, why don't you give him a call? Oh, I'm sure. Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing! Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi? I'm reading your ad. Yeah.

So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us? So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat? Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat! No you don't. No you do--y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this. I do not always have to be--okay, okay. Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio. Yes, we have to tell her! Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her. Thank you. Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say? You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs? Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place. No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat! None. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother. Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon. Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do. I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional. The volcano? With such a sad history. So why don`t you quit? Who is Maria? You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand? So you`re strong enough to face her on your own? They make you take an oath? Then how do you explain the toe ring?! Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong. One more time, "Hey, don`t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?" Good! That`s good! Me? No. It`s okay man, be strong. No! And I`m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech. And that`s funny, why? Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source. And that`s not against your oath?! Hello. We`d like to close our accounts. No-no. No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account. Hello! What's this? Oh right it`s that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. Oh, mine's December... Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda. Good luck! Come on, Pheebs lay off him. Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love. Hey! So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight! Oh. Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves. Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something. Oh! Monica knows. Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head. Hi! Wow! You-you look great! Okay! Hey Tommy. Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure. What? I-I-I... Who wants to make some long distance calls? Her date tipped me ten dollars. Pheebs, what are you doing? Are you serious? Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight? At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies. You see Amanda and I have a very special... Fine. Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship. You're welcome for a delicious dinner. I know! Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era. I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh?

Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here. What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there. No, I tried that.

I mean that`s-that`s when I really found my sound. Yeah. Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven`t played in so long, and-and, well it`s-it`s really personal stuff, y`know? No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in.. No, yeah, okay. Okay, guys. Here we go. Y`know, I`ve-I`ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it`s important that-that you understand it`s about communicating very private emotions. Y`know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That`s what I..... Really?! I mean, really?!! Wow! Thanks, you guys. That`s uh, ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I`ll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I`m I am so.... Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time... Thank you guys-guys-guys.... Hey! Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don`t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true? Pheebs! See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y`know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won`t play anymore. Yeah, okay. Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice. What? No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would`ve just stepped aside. Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe. Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this. Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y`know, I`m not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set? Yeah, like I could lose it. I played bad on purpose guys. Yeah, no, just that last song. Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office? Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that. Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly! So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch. Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me? Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me. Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back. Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year. Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh.... Hey! What are you doing? Everything? Even the TV? Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out? That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him? You've sentenced him?! Joey, the guy's your best friend. Oh, who? Me? Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend? I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler. He's coming here for Thanksgiving! Yeah. Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather. Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it? I just wanna check something. Now, we'll see. The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver. Oh my God! You actually exchanged it! What did you get? Hey. Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em? Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them. There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings. I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that. He's taking her purse! What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van! I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch. Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town? Dude, we are sooo gonna party! Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world. I'm gonna call after you! Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard! Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school? Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit! Somewhere maybe along the equator? What happened? Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky! It's Gandolf, and he's not coming. No! I balanced my checkbook. I can't believe he didn't come! Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them! There's other stuff too. Yeah! Yeah!! It's not like we don't know how to party!! Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat? Yeah. Okay. I'm kinda beat. Yeah, me too. I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place. How sad are we? And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath! Hey! I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything? 15? Your personal best! Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate. Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight. You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun. Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist. Hey! I wasn't sleeping. The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date. No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought, it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn. Y'know, you're right. Thank you. What? What? Are we really in Montreal?! Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal? What? Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period. Oh my God. Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else. The stuff I just mentioned. Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason. And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. Yeah, I was going for the metaphor. Just go for it Chandler.  That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later. Hey. Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria. It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides *never* sit together. It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right? Thank you Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table in the middle. I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me. You know, we work in the Museum of Natural History, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see? I see division. Division between people with white coats and people in blue blazers. And I ask, myself, my God, WHY? Now I say, we shed these coats that separate us and get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross. I'm divorced, and I have a kid. All right, there you go. Okay, okay, good for you. oh, uh, er, Wow, Rhonda. Ah, okay Scott! Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?

Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so.... Oh come on! That’s-that’s, true. Hey! So uh, Emily called last night.... Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding! Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great." Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful, didn’t you see Personal Best? How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her! What a weird way to kick me when I’m down. Oh. What’s wrong with Ross? Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found, Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. Hey! Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he’s sweeping. So umm, any word from Susan? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun? Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married. Am I?! Am I?! Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else. There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening? OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!! So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together! Oh, wake up! Excuse me? Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person. What? It does not! This is not fun! Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing. Nice luggage. Hi! Oh, I missed you too. No tongue. Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowie? Uh, I don’t know, whatever. Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy! Yeah? Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day. One more day, seriously.... So, then you can stay as long as you want. Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on. No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy. Hey, guys! Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it. I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing? Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle. Yeah!! Yeah! I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, "Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off." Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here! I could ask her to live with me! I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?! Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know? I don’t want to do that. Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. Hey! Move in with me. Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be. I know. Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you! No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t, you don’t think there’s any way? What? No, no, don’t. Why don’t we? Get married. No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want. Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it? Is that, are you saying yes? Is that yes? Yes! We’re getting married?! Yes! Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me? Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell! Come on! Come on. Come on. Hey! Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married. We, we just decided to uh, to go for it. Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys... Yeah. Hey guys! Oh no, not yet. Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach? Yeah, oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London. Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress. Thank you. What’s wah-pah? Hey! Hey, do uh, do you have a minute? So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were. I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda... y’know. Yeah? All right, I just wanted to check. You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there. Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh. Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet. Oh. Yeah? Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible. Uh-huh. I gotta get to work. Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy? If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night? Yeah, all right, it’s a date. Did you say something? Hey man. So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today? Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month! Yep! Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so, I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know? Hey! So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock? Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three. What happened? Noo. Why? Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry. Come here. Yeah. You okay? Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? Yeah? Sure. Why not? Yeah? Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her? Yeah sure. Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want. I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again! Hi. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? Okay... okay, maybe I will... See, I see.... big passion in your future. I do. Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. OK. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... Yes, yes, that's right... What? Ow! You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen. Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine. You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. Fine. Good. No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore. Is this about Mark? Okay, it’s not, it’s not. Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do. Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogurt, or something.. Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! Yeah! Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!! Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. Yes, you can, very much. Ahhhh!! No!! No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this. What? She was... She, she was different. Nobody likes change. What? Okay, okay, okay, okay. WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!! Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment. You think? Hey, you’re right. But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-- Rach, I got a message from you. You're over me? Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me? When, when were you... under me? OK, I need to lie down. Really. It's always been you, Rach. I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight. What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box. Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place. Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember? You still love me? What does this mean?
