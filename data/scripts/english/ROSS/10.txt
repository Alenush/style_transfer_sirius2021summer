... finally...
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Weh...*sigh*
Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
Thanks! Thank you!
Rach, you there?
Rach?
Is everything okay?
Hey.
You know where Joey is?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Hey!
You guys ready to go?
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Learn about Jesus...
Hey!
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Stop it!
You're filthy!
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
You've never said that in your life, have you?
I thought so.
Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
No, I'll do it.
Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Hey Rach...
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Hey!
So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
What?
Are you serious?
I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Thanks!
Hi!
Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Yeah!
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Well, I'm so excited about this.
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Okay, shoot!
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
So you two are..?
And have you .. ed?
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
It's all working out! Me &amp; Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
My fajitas!!
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Totally.
No!
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
Okay.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
I don't even know what that's for.
Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
So you took off my pants and shoes?
What do you mean?
Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Joey.
And she feels the same way?
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
Yeah, I'm sure.
WOW!
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Two, I think a two.
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Well, I have a PhD, so...
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
You sprayed my front twice!
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Oh! And it gets worse!
How do you count to five?
Damnit!
I Know!
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Which... which... which... Which one is it?
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Dude, you're not tanned.
Yeah!
No.
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Hey guys!
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Yeah!
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Ah, and where is Joey?
Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
When they see this you'll be 52!
Hey!
Oh, great!
Thank you so much for that gift!
Amazing... amazing.
Sure.
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
RACHEL!
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Yeah?
Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Hey!
It's not bad.
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Okay, you ready?
A-a-and... record.
Hey...
Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
B, B, B, B, B!
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Damnit!
Hi Amy!
Still sharp as a tack!
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Yes, yes, you did.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Oh my God!
What... what you working on?
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Seriously?
Well, do you wanna marry him?
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
I don't think that's what this is.
Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
I... I don't know..
Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Why not?
Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
What?
Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
That's not a thing!
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
No more falafel for you!
Pheebs, what's wrong?
So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Hey!
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
Yeah. Why?
Your ex-boyfriend?
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
Well, if you think it would help.
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
We'll see how dinner goes.
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
I'm ok.
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
What?
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Are you serious?
No!
I guess!
What? I... I...
May 12th?
Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
Ok. B - O - S ...
Oh come on!!
No! Stop!
Really?
I have to break up with Charlie?
You're crazy.
Crazy!
Get out!
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Damnit!
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Too little, too late, Benji!
No!
What?
or...
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Hey you guys!
Hey, what are you doing?
Yeah!
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
Hi!
Oh, good!
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Be-caaauuuse...
Seriously?
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.
Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Ok.
Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Here we go!
See, I told you!
Oh, absolutely!
Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
Good.
WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
I know.
Ok...
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
See?
There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Are you kidding?
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
She's putting words in your mouth!
Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Guess where they are?
Did I do something to you?
So?
He's right, man.
We're still going at the game, right?
Yeah.
Oh! What a game, huh?
I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
One more fight!
Okay.
Forty-five minutes.
Here!
You may want to lose the foam finger!
Hey!
We're late too!
So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
So this is an annual thing?
Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
HEY!
I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
We know you're out there.
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
What is that?
Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
That's worse than no food.
I don't know...
Yeah, he can do it!
I feel terrible.
Really girls, not cool.
It's a day to be thankful.
Yeah! Let's go out.
Okay.
I gave them to Joey.
I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Nice!
Hey!
Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Hey!
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
How does this look?
C'mon! This looks good!
Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
You're wearing the same shirt.
You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Wow!
Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Really?
So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
So? What do you think?
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Here So this was fun!
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Food.
Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
I know, and with the baby coming?
I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
No one, I’m just saying if...
I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
What's going on?
Oh my God.
So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
What?
You put an offer on a house?
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
You can see where he'd have trouble.
That money is mine, Green!
What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Two seconds...
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
No, 19.
Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Correct, his profession was?
Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
What the hell are doing?!!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Love you guys.
I love this.
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Really? Which one?
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Except for "Match game"...
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Yeah-uh!
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Dude. You're married to my sister.
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Yes please.
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Hey, Missy...
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
Boss!
She's gone.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Me too. I'm good at it.
You got it.
Those are the pacts!
Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
I know, and I can't stop sweating.
So, Saturday night!
Great!
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Yeah, why?
You did?
AND ON MY TURF?
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
You broke the pact!
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
I didn't.
No.
NO!
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
I don't know what... you're talking about.
Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Cool!
I didn't know you knew about that.
Man... I... I'm sorry.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
We are even, right?
What did you do to my mom?
Hey, where's Rachel?
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Well, it matters to me.
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Mine.
No, she was definitely on my bed.
Well, then who was on my bed?
NO! No, no!
You were under the pile of coats?
OH MY GOD!
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Hi!
Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
That is why!
Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
I wanna say it's not looking good.
What?
Oh, man!
FOOTBALL!
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Who cares, AND?
I'll do it!
No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Please, you're going down!
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
So, what did you decide?
I'll do it!
Hey!
Where's Rach?
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
YES, YES!
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Well, you have fun tonight.
Oh, I will.
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
I'm not supposed to tell you!
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
I'll...
It's the dog.
Uh Joey...
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
It was ok...
Hey.
You guys know where Rachel is?
So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
Hey!
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Oh my God.
Is-is he ok?
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Still-still, let me come... for me.
I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Oh!
And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
I'm feeling better.
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Did the TV wake you?
Ouchy.
Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
Right, is it painful?
Nope, just the one. RACH!
Hey!
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Wow.
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Sorry. . You ok?
You had a rough day, uh?
But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Good night.
Sure!
Oh, of course...
Me too. Come here.
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
I'll see you in the morning .
Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
You sure you're alright?
O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
There it is...
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Well...
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Hey, I was looking out for you.
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
Emma's down for the night.
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Oh, no problem.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Oh, ye-ah!
...Valentine's day...
Hmmm-mmmm.
Not even once.
Even if we want it really bad.
Uhm, right!
Yeah.
...I hate waste.
Yes?
Damn it. It's never off the table.
Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
No, no. I-I'm good.
I'm up for tenure.
You too! What are the odds?
Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
But also knowing it means a lot.
...that center around work.
You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Rach, I'm so sorry.
Great. I feel like an idiot.
Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
That is Mark?
I hate that guy.
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Hey, is Rachel here?
She's still at dinner?
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Should we send something?
Congratulations!
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Hey!
Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
Right, no, I understand.
No, no, I knew .
She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
What are you guys doing?
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Rock on!
Hey, where's Rach?
Great.
Here she is!
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Yeah?
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Hey. What was that all about?
Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
I don't think so.
God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
Okay, here we go...
Yeah...
Huh?
What? I don't get a goodbye?
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Well, it needs to be plicit.
No, I don't think so.
O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
THE HELL I DO!
I don't get a goodbye?
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
That's what it seemed like.
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Rach!
You keep, you keep... You can't...
Rach!
Hey.
Oh. This was amazing.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
Who's laughing now?
What?
Oh my God!
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Is Rachel here?
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
I know, it's pretty great.
Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Shhh!
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Hey.
Hey. How did you sleep?
Good.
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
So...
Morning.
It really was.
I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Nothing! What do you say to that?
No way!
What?
You really think so?
Okay.
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
What? What?
Oh my God!
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Hey.
No, and I'm not going to.
Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Oh my God.
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Neither will I.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
I don't! I wanna be with her.
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
My coat...
I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Okay, guys, wish me luck.
There's no seatbelt!
Alright, alright, let's do this!
Hey!
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
Get out of the cab!
Are we off the bridge?
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
What?
Okay!
To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
What? We're never gonna make it!
Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Hey, I need a ticket.
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
That's alright. Listen, listen.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
What?
JFK.
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
I am not doing this over the phone.
Yay.
Where is she?
Rachel! Rachel Green!
Rachel! Rachel!
No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
No, no, no, but...
Okay, the thing is..
Don't go.
Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
Rachel?
I really thought she'd stay.
Oh my God!
Let her off the plane!
Try to understand!
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
You got off the plane.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Don't make jokes now.
Wow.
Uh, I haven't.
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?

You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest. So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris? Okay. All right, we'll work it out. Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want? Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this? Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it? I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off. I didn't say we were brothers. Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago. Close. Ron. Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back. Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back. Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true? Huh, I took a shot there. I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son? Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils! You let Rachel come back, and it's done. Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life. He'll be fine. Hi. Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it. Ok. Nooo! So, you're not going to Paris. Wh… wh…what? Yeeeah! It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back. Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?  Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg  replica. Huh? So? We have a deal? Yes! yes! Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it! Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. Hey! What? They did? So, what are you gonna do? That's great! So you're staying in New York! You're excited, right? Right! Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared. You should go. It's what you want. You should go. I really do. I'm sure he'll understand. Yeah... Yeah, yeah, oh! Then I'm happy too.
