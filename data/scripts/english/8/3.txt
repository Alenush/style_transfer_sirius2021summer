ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?
МОНИКА: Yeah I am!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…
МОНИКА: That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’d better go pack.
МОНИКА: Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good you’re still here!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
МОНИКА: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
ДЖОУИ: We know its Ross!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How?! How do you know?
ФИБИ: It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.
МОНИКА: This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know!
ФИБИ: Me too!
ДЖОУИ: I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
МОНИКА: Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!
МОНИКА: Well, what were you gonna say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I was gonna tell him that I’mI’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
ДЖОУИ: Well that, that sounds good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
МОНИКА: Hey! Good luck!
ФИБИ: Yeah, bye.
ДЖОУИ: Bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, what was that all about?
МОНИКА: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
МОНИКА: I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
ДЖОУИ: What secrets?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
ДЖОУИ: You’ll tell me later?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You already know.
ФИБИ: Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
ФИБИ: All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.
ФИБИ: What?! They took mine to give to you!
ДЖОУИ: Why would they take away our keys?
ФИБИ: Maybe they don’t trust us.
ДЖОУИ: No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
ФИБИ: You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I washed those!
ФИБИ: No you didn’t.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah that didn’t sound like me.
ФИБИ: Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
ФИБИ: What stuff?
ДЖОУИ: Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Did Rachel find you?
РОСС: No why?
ФИБИ: Oh she was looking for you.
РОСС: Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
ФИБИ: Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
РОСС: Oh no.
ФИБИ: What?
РОСС: I think I might know what this is about.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
ФИБИ: And?
РОСС: Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
ФИБИ: Oh sorry. And?!
РОСС: Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.
РОСС: Why? What-what else could it be?
ДЖОУИ: Oh wow, I don’t feel well.
РОСС: I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
ФИБИ: Maybe it’s something you ate?
ДЖОУИ: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
РОСС: Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.
НЕДРУГ: Next?
МОНИКА: They’re kissing let’s just go around them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.
МОНИКА: I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
НЕДРУГ: Next?
МОНИКА: Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, Next.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. We didn’t hear you we’re on our honeymoon.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available.
МОНИКА: Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are on our honeymoon.
МОНИКА: Grab my ass!
НЕДРУГ: Next?
МОНИКА: Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K.
МОНИКА: Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
МОНИКА: You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?
ДЖОУИ: I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
ФИБИ: Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
ДЖОУИ: What the hell is that?
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: You said there was a gas leak in here.
ФИБИ: Well why don’t you use your key?
НЕДРУГ: Because by the time I find it on this thing, the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up.
ФИБИ: Oh! We could have done that.
МОНИКА: Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
МОНИКА: Me neither! We have to get in!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just act like you belong.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Oranges!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shh! Nice to see you again.
НЕДРУГ: Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, of course.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
НЕДРУГ: Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Apology accepted. Excuse us.
НЕДРУГ: Sir! I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.
МОНИКА: Fine. Go! Go! Go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.
РОСС: I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? Look uh, I know why you’re here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You do?
РОСС: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Seriously. What?!
РОСС: Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’dI’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?
РОСС: Oh sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you’re ready. And you’re the father by the way—but you got that…
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I get you some water?
РОСС: I’m good. I’m good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
РОСС: Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97 of the time.
РОСС: What? What? What?! Well they should put that on the box!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They do!
РОСС: No they don’t! Well they should put it in huge black letters!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.
РОСС: Oh well I may as well have!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…
РОСС: Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.
РОСС: No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y’know maybe I should come back…
РОСС: Shh! Shh! Shh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Yeah I’ll press 1!
НЕДРУГ: I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak.
ДЖОУИ: Huh. So then I can heat this up?
НЕДРУГ: Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door.
ФИБИ: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
НЕДРУГ: Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll find out anyway.
ФИБИ: Oh no.
НЕДРУГ: Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross!
РОСС: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
РОСС: Sure.
НЕДРУГ: Namaste.
РОСС: Namaste.
РОСС: Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
ДЖОУИ: So it’s noticeable huh?
РОСС: Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
ФИБИ: Didn’t you two already talk?
РОСС: Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. Rachel’s pregnant.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! I can’t believe that!
ФИБИ: Holy mother of God!
РОСС: With my child.
ФИБИ: That is brand new information!
РОСС: You already know don’t you?
ФИБИ: A little bit.
ДЖОУИ: How are you doing?
РОСС: Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
ДЖОУИ: Well, what did you say to her?
РОСС: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
ФИБИ: Oh Ross.
РОСС: But hey, in my defense II just found out condoms are like only 97 effective.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: I gotta go find her.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3 of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
РОСС: Evidently they do.
ДЖОУИ: What?!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe we’re here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
МОНИКА: What?
НЕДРУГ: As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
МОНИКА: No! You have been screwing us all day!
НЕДРУГ: Who are you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re you just ten seconds later!
МОНИКА: Yeah! You already got the first class tickets you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!
НЕДРУГ: Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We need the stuff.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.
МОНИКА: What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What else is new?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.
МОНИКА: Well do something! Get in there!
ДЖОУИ: How? I guess I could break down your door.
МОНИКА: Yeah! Do that!
ДЖОУИ: And-and you won’t blame us for any damage?
МОНИКА: No! Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, okay I’llI’llI’ll break it down.
ФИБИ: Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. Okay, we’re in.
НЕДРУГ: Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: If I said I was, would you judge me?
НЕДРУГ: The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…
РОСС: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Uh we-we need to talk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
РОСС: Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?
РОСС: What? Oh yeah. I’m sorry. I mean II think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
РОСС: Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What married?
РОСС: Well yeah, I think we should get married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, because that’s your answer to everything?
РОСС: No, because that’s the right thing to do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
РОСС: No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me?
РОСС: Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can too eat by myself!
РОСС: When have you ever?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
РОСС: Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please, you inhale your food!
РОСС: I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!
НЕДРУГ: Am I interrupting?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
РОСС: But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
НЕДРУГ: Huh. Nice to meet you. I’ll get started on this.
РОСС: I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
РОСС: Oh my God.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. There it is, I see it.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations. I’ll give you two a minute.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Thank you.
РОСС: Pretty amazing huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t see it!
РОСС: What? What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can’t see it!
РОСС: You-you just said that you did!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!
РОСС: Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now.
РОСС: Do you really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I don’t see it!
РОСС: Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Sweetie that’s it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
РОСС: You’re welcome.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.
РОСС: Yeah, that’s our baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! So how was the doctor?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, everything went great.
ФИБИ: Good.
РОСС: Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
ФИБИ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t see the baby. Where is it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… Ross, I lost it again.
РОСС: Oh. He takes the picture and hugs her.
