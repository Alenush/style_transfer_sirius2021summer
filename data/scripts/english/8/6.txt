МОНИКА: Hey you guys? 
РОСС: What? 
МОНИКА: I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party. 
ФИБИ: Oh good! 
МОНИКА: And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It’ll be fun! 
РОСС: Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur. 
РОСС: Not two years in a row. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up. 
МОНИКА: You have to! 
ДЖОУИ: No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not… 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re an actor! 
МОНИКА: So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona? 
РОСС: Yeah. Yeah, I think I will. 
ДЖОУИ: That hot girl from their wedding? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface. 
ФИБИ: Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too? 
РОСС: That’s right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. Please don’t take her from me. 
ФИБИ: Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye. 
ФИБИ: Wait a second! So, what’s new with you? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, nothing. I mean, I’m getting married next week. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Yeah, it’s gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. His. 
ФИБИ: Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait! If umm, if you want to come, I guess that’d be okay. 
ФИБИ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying. 
НЕДРУГ: Huh. Well, I’m supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I’m supposed to be working right now, so who cares. 
ФИБИ: By the way, it’s a costume party. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Okay, so that’s why you’re… 
ФИБИ: No. But thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it. 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh! 
МОНИКА: I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Trick or treat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts. 
НЕДРУГ: Trick or treat!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just a minute!!! Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you are a very funny clown. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but… 
НЕДРУГ: Can I just have the candy? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Sure. 
ФИБИ: Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again. 
МОНИКА: So we do Supergirl. 
ФИБИ: No, it’s me. Phoebe! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you did this to him? 
МОНИКА: What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white! 
МОНИКА: Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: You didn’t dress up either?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes I did! I’m Chandler. Dude, what happened? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How is that me? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. I’m Chandler 
ФИБИ: That is so you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When have I ever done that?! 
ДЖОУИ: When have I ever done that?! 
НЕДРУГ: Trick or treat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy. 
НЕДРУГ: I love you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy? 
МОНИКА: What?! There’s only been like four kids. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything. 
ФИБИ: No wonder your pregnant. 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: What are you supposed to be? 
РОСС: Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes… Spud-nik. Spudnik! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey all right, Ross came as doody. 
РОСС: No, I-I’m not doody. 
МОНИКА: No, space doody! 
НЕДРУГ: Aren’t you gonna give me a kiss? 
ФИБИ: Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are. 
НЕДРУГ: Ursula? 
ФИБИ: Ursula’s fiancée? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, you’re the sister! 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law’s ass. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt. 
ФИБИ: My mother killed herself. 
НЕДРУГ: She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, "Look at me," I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go. 
ФИБИ: No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe. 
НЕДРУГ: Eric. 
ФИБИ: Why are you looking at me like that? 
НЕДРУГ: ‘Cause the sweat’s getting in my eyes and its burning. 
ФИБИ: Okay. So, what are you? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think they have a name for it. It’s just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy. 
ФИБИ: No I-I meant your costume. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh umm, I’m the solar system. Yeah, my students helped me make it—I teach the second grade. 
ФИБИ: I love the second grade! 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games. 
НЕДРУГ: So what do you do? 
ФИБИ: Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know you don’t have to stand here with me, believe me… 
ФИБИ: No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh I feel very lucky, she’s great. I think she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. 
ФИБИ: Thank you. 
МОНИКА: Hey Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: You read comic books right? 
ДЖОУИ: Exclusively. 
МОНИКА: Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl? 
ДЖОУИ: Catwoman, hands down. 
МОНИКА: Yeah… 
ДЖОУИ: But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe. 
МОНИКА: What?! Really?! 
ДЖОУИ: Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she? 
МОНИКА: No you’re fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel? 
ДЖОУИ: I’m not sure. 
МОНИКА: What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! As hard as you can! 
ДЖОУИ: Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter. 
МОНИКА: Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up? 
ДЖОУИ: I would say, "Woman, please!" 
ФИБИ: Hey. Ursula’s fiancée is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: What? 
МОНИКА: You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fiancée. 
ФИБИ: No I’m not! You are! 
ДЖОУИ: Here comes the temper. 
НЕДРУГ: Trick or treat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, what’s your name? 
НЕДРУГ: Lelani Mayolanofavich. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mona! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse. 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, actually I’m just a nurse. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed out. 
РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РОСС: You made it! 
НЕДРУГ: Wait-wait! You’re umm, you’re a potato… 
РОСС: Well, I’m a spud… 
НЕДРУГ: And the antennae…Oh my God you’re Spudnik! 
РОСС: Yes! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marry her. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler. 
МОНИКА: I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband. 
ДЖОУИ: So Ross? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey beautiful. 
ФИБИ: Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet? 
НЕДРУГ: Two weeks ago. 
ФИБИ: Two weeks? That’s it? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it’s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she’s just so perfect, and we have so much in common. 
ФИБИ: Oh really? 
НЕДРУГ: We’re both teachers. 
ФИБИ: Huh? 
НЕДРУГ: And we were both in the Peace Corps. 
ФИБИ: Peace Corps, really? 
НЕДРУГ: In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. It wasn’t a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. Shall we get me really drunk? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Howdy doody. 
РОСС: That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What question? 
ДЖОУИ: Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s no question. 
ДЖОУИ: So you think Ross too? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You picked Ross?! 
МОНИКА: Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I cannot believe you didn’t pick me. 
РОСС: Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? 
РОСС: Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!! 
МОНИКА: Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you guys could arm wrestle. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re going down. 
РОСС: Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown! 
ДЖОУИ: Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world. 
НЕДРУГ: Trick or treat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go! 
НЕДРУГ: My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy. 
НЕДРУГ: I’d rather have the money. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween! 
НЕДРУГ: This isn’t fair. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff? 
НЕДРУГ: Shut up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You shut up! 
НЕДРУГ: You can’t tell me to shut up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up! 
ДЖОУИ: Rach? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up! 
НЕДРУГ: You’re a mean old woman. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! 
МОНИКА: Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That means nothing to me. Come on! 
ФИБИ: Hi liar! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true. 
НЕДРУГ: Well they could be true. 
ФИБИ: But they’re not! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it’s a fine line huh? 
ФИБИ: Why are you lying to him? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun. 
НЕДРУГ: Honey? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now! 
НЕДРУГ: She’s helped so many people to quit smoking. 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, we’d really better get going. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh right, you’ve got a church group meeting tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it was nice meeting you. 
ФИБИ: You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!! 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get? 
РОСС: Pride. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And dignity. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! They’re both really strong. 
ДЖОУИ: Or equally weak. 
МОНИКА: Oh God! 
ФИБИ: Hmm? 
МОНИКА: Chandler’s making his sex face. 
РОСС: So, you gettin’ tired? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope! I can do this all day. 
РОСС: Yeah? Me too. Gettin’ a little tired though. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God, I’m exhausted. 
РОСС: Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s standing right over there. Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp! 
РОСС: Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re Spudnik. 
РОСС: Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine. Oh no! 
РОСС: Oh yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Yay! My hero! 
ДЖОУИ: You’re a weird lady. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Ursula said she left her purse. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain. 
ФИБИ: Sure it does. Yeah, yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding. 
ФИБИ: Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world. 
НЕДРУГ: I think we’ll be okay. Besides it’s so perfect and she’s been saving herself for me. 
ФИБИ: Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ФИБИ: She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was? 
НЕДРУГ: She told me she was 25. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. Just remember I’m a minute younger. 
НЕДРУГ: I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher. There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies. 
ФИБИ: No. You’re not, you’re not stupid. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m not smart. I just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. To be romantic. 
ФИБИ: That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. What? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different. 
НЕДРУГ: Eric!! Let’s go!! 
НЕДРУГ: I’d better go, deal… 
ФИБИ: Yeah, you should. 
НЕДРУГ: Hurry up I gotta pray!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s not so bad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children! 
ДЖОУИ: Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? You think that’s all it is? 
ДЖОУИ: Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. 
МОНИКА: Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win. 
МОНИКА: Is that a secret or a lie. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I let him win—Ross! 
РОСС: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you tell her I let you win please? 
РОСС: Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am strong! I’ll show you! 
МОНИКА: Chandler please! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared? 
МОНИКА: Let’s go big bunny! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 1…2…3—Go! I’m gonna kill myself!
