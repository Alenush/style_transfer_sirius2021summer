МОНИКА: Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey how was dinner?! 
ФИБИ: Dinner was good! 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
ФИБИ: I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go! 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
ФИБИ: Oh, well hello there. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
ФИБИ: I didn’t see this on the menu. 
МОНИКА: Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef. 
ФИБИ: Oh, so you're Monica’s boss? 
НЕДРУГ: Actually she’s my-my boss. Sous is French for under. 
ФИБИ: Oh! I sous stand. 
МОНИКА: Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Oh you…you made pesto? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes I did. 
ФИБИ: Would you say your pesto is the best-o? 
НЕДРУГ: I…I-I don’t know, but I would say it’s pretty good-o. 
МОНИКА: All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad. 
НЕДРУГ: I like your necklace. 
ФИБИ: I made it myself. 
НЕДРУГ: You are so talented. 
ФИБИ: Well, it’s no pesto. 
МОНИКА: All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? You’re single. You’re single. He gets off work at eleven. She’ll be waiting for your call. I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn? 
НЕДРУГ: You’re a joker Bing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s funny about that? 
РОСС: Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go? 
РОСС: Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The Hard Rock Café? 
РОСС: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again?! 
РОСС: Yeah!! 
РОСС: I’m telling you, I like the food! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Toby! Have a good night. 
РОСС: Did that guy just call you Toby? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he thinks that’s my name. 
РОСС: Well, why don’t you correct him? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby. 
РОСС: Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. 
РОСС: Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shh! It is a family name! 
РОСС: Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they? 
НЕДРУГ: Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss. 
НЕДРУГ: What is it? 
НЕДРУГ: Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain. 
НЕДРУГ: Is it serious? 
НЕДРУГ: Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain. 
НЕДРУГ: Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that. 
НЕДРУГ: We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone. 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! Very nice people! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?! 
ДЖОУИ: I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don’t know do you? 
ДЖОУИ: No, couldn’t care less. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey good scene man. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey you too! 
НЕДРУГ: Alright. 
ДЖОУИ: What? You weren’t in it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes? 
ДЖОУИ: This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm. 
ДЖОУИ: Here we go! Here we go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Say hi to Wally. 
ФИБИ: Ooh Monica! 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him. 
МОНИКА: I…I have to fire him. 
ФИБИ: But why?! 
МОНИКА: Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire! 
ФИБИ: Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two. 
МОНИКА: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished. 
ФИБИ: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please? 
МОНИКА: All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there! 
ФИБИ: That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too. 
МОНИКА: I paid to have this done. 
ФИБИ: Love it! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I thought I was a complete idiot. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say? 
ДЖОУИ: I said no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant? 
ДЖОУИ: I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Bob. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I see him, I’ll ask. 
НЕДРУГ: Toby! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh then you know each other. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re on a semi-first name basis. 
НЕДРУГ: What do you think of adding him to our team? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? They love him down on six. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it’s best sir. 
НЕДРУГ: But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s a good one. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go! 
ФИБИ: But… 
МОНИКА: No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!" 
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today. 
МОНИКА: Why not?! 
ФИБИ: Because I’m dumping him today. 
МОНИКА: What?! You said he was sweet! 
ФИБИ: He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?" 
МОНИКА: Just don’t pick up your phone. 
ФИБИ: Then he comes over! "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man! 
МОНИКА: What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him? 
ФИБИ: You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself. 
МОНИКА: Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week. 
ФИБИ: Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself! 
МОНИКА: Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it! 
ФИБИ: Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch. 
МОНИКА: What do you mean? 
ФИБИ: Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch! 
МОНИКА: I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first. 
ФИБИ: All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Toby, you got a sec? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, what’s up? 
НЕДРУГ: I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?" 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested? 
ДЖОУИ: No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya. 
РОСС: Rach? You wanna come? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I can’t. I got a date. 
РОСС: A date? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you? 
РОСС: Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull. 
ДЖОУИ: It’s no Ukrainian film. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! 
РОСС: A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who? 
ДЖОУИ: I set her up with this actor on my show. 
РОСС: You set her up?! 
ДЖОУИ: No 
РОСС: Joey what-what were you thinking?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years! 
РОСС: Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I’m an actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island. 
РОСС: A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?! 
ДЖОУИ: Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? 
РОСС: Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РОСС: A bit of a daredevil are we? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rachel! You ready to go? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later. 
РОСС: Okay. Have a great time you guys. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РОСС: Yes it is too slutty! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s because I’m with you. 
ФИБИ: Aw. I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I… 
НЕДРУГ: Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. 
ФИБИ: Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay. 
НЕДРУГ: Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here. 
ДЖОУИ: So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books. 
РОСС: Books? 
ДЖОУИ: All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough! 
РОСС: Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang. 
ДЖОУИ: And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date? 
РОСС: Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude! What is going on?! 
РОСС: I just…I have to find out how it went. 
ДЖОУИ: Why? 
РОСС: This guy could be my baby’s stepfather! 
ДЖОУИ: They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you! 
РОСС: I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do? 
РОСС: I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening. 
ДЖОУИ: What do you mean? 
РОСС: It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that! 
РОСС: No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel? 
РОСС: It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though. 
ДЖОУИ: Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel. 
РОСС: No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were? 
ДЖОУИ: I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants. 
РОСС: No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on! 
РОСС: We can still catch that Ukrainian film. 
ДЖОУИ: No, I said fun! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Toby! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Bobby. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why? 
НЕДРУГ: I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here. 
НЕДРУГ: Toby don’t. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bob! 
НЕДРУГ: Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that puts me in a difficult position. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: I got your page, is everything okay? 
МОНИКА: Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us! 
МОНИКА: Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Monica! 
МОНИКА: You’re fired! 
ФИБИ: I’m breaking up with you! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ФИБИ: I’m, I’m breaking up with you. 
МОНИКА: You’re fired. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
ФИБИ: I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now. 
МОНИКА: Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right. 
ФИБИ: Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Umm, okay. Umm… I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it’s only because I think you’re so amazing. And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I—you’re the most talented chef I’ve ever worked for. Anyway… 
МОНИКА: Tim wait! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you so much! ‘Cause I-I know I can do better! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ФИБИ: And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. 
РОСС: Hello. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
РОСС: Well, how was the date? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think? 
РОСС: Uh-huh. What happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant. 
РОСС: Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want. 
РОСС: Oh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch." 
РОСС: He sounds swell. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Doesn’t he? 
РОСС: Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
РОСС: Sit down. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
РОСС: Guess whose middle name is Muriel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler M. Bing? 
РОСС: Yeah-ha! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
РОСС: I’m sorry about your date. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard. 
РОСС: Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks sweetie. 
РОСС: You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. 
РОСС: Hey, I thought I cheered you up. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh you did, there are twenty in here. 
РОСС: Right. Good night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good night. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross? 
РОСС: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey it’s Mona! From the wedding. 
РОСС: Oh hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РОСС: Wow! Uh…how are you? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m good except umm, you still owe me a dance. 
РОСС: Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh you’re serious. Sure! 
РОСС: Great! Well umm… 
НЕДРУГ: I think I might need one more cup of coffee. 
РОСС: Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?! 
НЕДРУГ: I just found out this is Chandler’s office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
