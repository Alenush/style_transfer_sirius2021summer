НЕДРУГ: Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РОСС: Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you! 
ДЖОУИ: What? What’s going on? 
РОСС: Monica’s pregnant! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?! 
МОНИКА: Guys! I’m not pregnant. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah. Slow swimmers? 
РОСС: What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant? 
МОНИКА: You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?! 
РОСС: No! I’ll be right back. 
НЕДРУГ: Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier. 
МОНИКА: Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party. 
ДЖОУИ: I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here. 
МОНИКА: Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. 
НЕДРУГ: Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant? 
МОНИКА: Because I’m not. 
ФИБИ: We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant——It’s because I am. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! What are you talking about? 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? 
ФИБИ: Yes, I…I am with child. And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder. 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who’s the father? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: I can’t say. 
МОНИКА: Why?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not? 
ФИБИ: I can’t say because he’s famous. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, who is it?! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us. 
ФИБИ: Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin? 
ФИБИ: What?! Well he never said that to me! 
НЕДРУГ: Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids. 
ФИБИ: How about just the bridemaids? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal. 
ФИБИ: It is. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For you. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet. 
ФИБИ: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you. 
ФИБИ: Sneaky. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Smile ladies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh by the way? 
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: James Brolin? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay. 
ФИБИ: Really?! 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya. 
МОНИКА: Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ve been taking dancing lessons. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget. 
МОНИКА: Oh that is so sweet! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife? 
МОНИКА: Yes. 
МОНИКА: What’s the matter? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery. 
МОНИКА: Well, are you going to be able to do this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not well. 
МОНИКА: Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us. 
ФИБИ: So, are you ready to talk about it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
ФИБИ: Now? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
ФИБИ: Okay, we’ll talk about something else then. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. 
ФИБИ: Who’s the father?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe!! 
ФИБИ: Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him. 
ФИБИ: Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him. 
МОНИКА: Oh sweet Lord. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day? 
МОНИКА: Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey! 
РОСС: Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi, I’m, I’m Mona from her restaurant. 
РОСС: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name. 
НЕДРУГ: You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it. 
РОСС: Aw come on, Mona Lisa? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world. 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her. 
РОСС: Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name. 
РОСС: Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d like you to meet Dennis Phillips. 
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I’m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show. 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani. 
НЕДРУГ: Dennis Phillips 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you. Well if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it’s a funny story. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Funny: ha-ha or funny: 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served. 
РОСС: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six. 
НЕДРУГ: No, nine. 
РОСС: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… Hello. 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What size shoes do you wear? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Those aren’t eleven and a half. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya! 
МОНИКА: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now? 
МОНИКА: This is so huge. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding? 
МОНИКА: Of course not nothing is. Between me and you… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through! 
МОНИКА: How? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know! Maybe they have tools. 
МОНИКА: Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave. 
МОНИКА: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well. 
МОНИКА: Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know. 
МОНИКА: Are you okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe. 
НЕДРУГ: Champagne? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it. 
ФИБИ: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin… 
МОНИКА: Oh really?! 
ФИБИ: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said… 
МОНИКА: Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant. 
ФИБИ: What?! Why bother? 
МОНИКА: How do you feel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!! 
ФИБИ: Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ФИБИ: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure. 
МОНИКА: Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How many ways are there to do that? 
ФИБИ: I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home. 
МОНИКА: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Thank you. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ФИБИ: I’ll run out and get you one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you guys are so great. 
МОНИКА: Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?! 
ФИБИ: Oh no, she won’t tell us. 
МОНИКА: Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick. 
ФИБИ: See? This is why you register. 
РОСС: It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РОСС: Umm, would you like to dance? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Oh great! 
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller? 
РОСС: I wasn’t farting! Uh, a little game from our table. Yes? 
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller, will you dance with me? 
РОСС: Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhh! 
РОСС: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first. 
НЕДРУГ: I’d be happy to. You are very sweet. 
РОСС: Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! 
РОСС: Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: Keep dancing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the world will never know. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РОСС: No-no, thank you Miranda. 
НЕДРУГ: Melinda! 
РОСС: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: How cute was that? 
РОСС: Oh-oh, were you, were you watching? 
НЕДРУГ: Can I go next? 
РОСС: What? Of course you can! Hop on! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, but I get to hop on after her. 
РОСС: I am so gonna score. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РОСС: I like your bow. 
ДЖОУИ: I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple! 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РОСС: That was very nice Ashley. 
НЕДРУГ: Can we do it again? 
РОСС: No-no. 
НЕДРУГ: So, is it my turn now? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m next! 
РОСС: Oh! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, that’s okay. You can dance with her first. 
РОСС: Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name. 
НЕДРУГ: Gert! 
РОСС: That’s, that’s pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert? 
НЕДРУГ: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it. 
РОСС: Okay. Hop on Gert. 
НЕДРУГ: Why aren’t you moving your feet? 
РОСС: I’m trying. 
НЕДРУГ: Faster! You’re not going fast enough! 
РОСС: Maybe I should stand on your feet! 
ДЖОУИ: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, that was for my benefit? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show… 
НЕДРУГ: Look umm Joey, I-I don’t think you’re quite right for this project. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese? 
ДЖОУИ: Well I’m not proud of this, but… 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don’t-don’t-don’t! 
МОНИКА: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did it turn into sand? 
МОНИКА: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot. 
МОНИКА: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go. 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? 
НЕДРУГ: You stole my moves. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How much longer? 
ФИБИ: 30 seconds. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 30 seconds, okay. 
МОНИКА: Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I know. I know. 
ФИБИ: It’s time. 
НЕДРУГ: No!! 
МОНИКА: Go ahead Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Umm, it’s negative. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ФИБИ: It’s negative. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God. 
МОНИКА: Well… Well, great. 
ФИБИ: Here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative? 
ФИБИ: No, it’s positive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ФИБИ: It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you sure? 
ФИБИ: Well yeah, I lied before. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
МОНИКА: Oh God… 
ФИБИ: Now you know how you really feel about it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game! 
МОНИКА: Are you really gonna do this? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! 
ФИБИ: With who? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, it’s still not the time. 
РОСС: I just didn’t see the fast song coming. 
ДЖОУИ: Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay. 
РОСС: Oh, thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: That is so sweet! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there. 
ДЖОУИ: Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s Joey right? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?!
