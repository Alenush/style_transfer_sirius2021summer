НЕДРУГ: Brian Buckner amp Sebastian Jones Story by: Dana Klein Borkow Transcribed by: Eric Aasen.
РОСС: Hey you guys I got some bad news.
ФИБИ: Well thats no way to sell newspapers. Why dont you try, Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
РОСС: No, Monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didnt want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
ДЖОУИ: Man, this is bad! And Ive had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
РОСС: Umm.
МОНИКА: Oh dear God!
РОСС: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
МОНИКА: What about the rest of Manhattan?!
РОСС: Yeah, they all know.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, this is horrible!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im so sorry.
МОНИКА: Im so humiliated!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but yknow what they say Mon, Theres no such thing as bad press.
МОНИКА: You dont think that umm, The chefs Mahi Mahi was awful awful, is bad press?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didnt write it.
МОНИКА: Is he right? Am I reallyAm I awful?
НЕДРУГ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And Im not just saying this because Im your friend, Im sayin it cause its the truth. Youre food is abysmal!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross!
РОСС: What?! What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am freaking out!
РОСС: Are ya?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My due date is in one week!
РОСС: What are you doing up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is seven days!
РОСС: Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
РОСС: Its funny you should mention diapers.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im serious.
РОСС: Okay look, theres nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. Theres a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Thank you. Thats great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because theres this really cute shoe store that has like this little.
РОСС: Okay. Okay. If uh, if youre gonna do this, then Im gonna do that. So.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait Ross! Im sorry, one more thing!
РОСС: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, our situation. Yknow umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-were having this baby together, and we live together. Isnt that, isnt that weird?
РОСС: Well uh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im just kidding! You can go pee!
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is cooking as Chandler looks on.
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh Monica, I cant remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
МОНИКА: We said at the movies, but.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, Ill see you there.
МОНИКА: Joey! Now that youre here.
ДЖОУИ: Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya. What uhHow come youre not going?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
ДЖОУИ: I thought you already have a job.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And people say you dont pay attention. No, this is a much better job. Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats what I do now.
МОНИКА: Hey Joey, come taste this.
ДЖОУИ: What is it?
МОНИКА: Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well Im getting my revenge!
ДЖОУИ: You cooked him?
МОНИКА: No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bollet base again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
НЕДРУГ: Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no! No, no, no, were not married.
РОСС: We are having a baby together, but were not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, wed like this delivered please.
НЕДРУГ: Why dont you fill out this address card.
РОСС: Oh, okay.
НЕДРУГ: I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! Actually, thats one of the reasons why were not a couple.
РОСС: I chose those, Im a paleontologist.
НЕДРУГ: Really?! That is so cool!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like hes a doctor, but hes not.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no, Im fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
РОСС: Yeah! II teach it in my class.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Im standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and Im bored.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I love your neighborhood. Theres a great gym right around the corner from your building.
РОСС: Thats my gym.
НЕДРУГ: I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, youre like Indiana Jones.
РОСС: I am like Indiana Jones.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasnt on the list. A whore.
ФИБИ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
ФИБИ: Well did she know you two werent married?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You dont understand! You didnt see how brazen she was.
ФИБИ: Sounds like youre a little jealous.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Im not! III just think its wrong! Its-its that ImHere I am about to pop and hes out picking up some shop girl at Sluts R Us!
ФИБИ: Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
ФИБИ: Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
ФИБИ: Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little nervous.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! You reallyYou look great.
ФИБИ: Yeah, just dont get your hopes up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not?
ФИБИ: Well, the interview.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about it?
ФИБИ: Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!
ФИБИ: Oh you dont know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious?!
ФИБИ: Yes, when I first met you, you were like, Blah, blah, blah. I was like, shhh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is it that I do?
ФИБИ: Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you like me when we first met?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, Im not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
МОНИКА: Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
НЕДРУГ: Still?
МОНИКА: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my boule base another chance.
НЕДРУГ: I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
ДЖОУИ: Either eat it, or be in it.
МОНИКА: Spoon? So, what do you think?
НЕДРУГ: Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
ДЖОУИ: Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here theres a new class comin in.
НЕДРУГ: Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bournese sauce?
МОНИКА: I can.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, go ahead.
МОНИКА: Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bournese has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly teradyne.
НЕДРУГ: Thats very good, whats your name?
МОНИКА: Monica.
НЕДРУГ: Monica, you go to the head of the class.
МОНИКА: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
РОСС: My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
РОСС: Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
НЕДРУГ: Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
РОСС: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
РОСС: Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. Uh yeah, actually Im free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or.
НЕДРУГ: Sure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Horny bitch. No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you guys go, have a really good time.
РОСС: Yeah, Im just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Yknow because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because ImIm into S amp M. Im notIm not into anything weird. Yknow? Just-just normal sex. So, Im gonna grab my coat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, you had a good day huh? Big commission picked up a daddy.
НЕДРУГ: Are you okay with this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. It was nice to see you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
НЕДРУГ: Oh umm, actually I umm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh okay, I see what youre doing there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly?
ФИБИ: Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good. Good, because Im sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
ФИБИ: All right, dont freak out! Okay? II will help you. How long before you have to leave?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: An hour.
ФИБИ: I cant help you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So lets say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. Hi! Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler Bing.
ФИБИ: Bing, what an unusual name.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. Ill let myself out.
ДЖОУИ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
ДЖОУИ: When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
НЕДРУГ: And the cream?
ДЖОУИ: Cheese makes me thirsty.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Lets move on.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station! Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
МОНИКА: Oh no! I dont know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
НЕДРУГ: Well, hats off to the chef.
МОНИКА: IIIm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
НЕДРУГ: The chef!
МОНИКА: Thats right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont micro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating.
ФИБИ: Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on what you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What I do dois manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
ФИБИ: I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.
ФИБИ: You gotta go!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh!
ФИБИ: Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
ФИБИ: Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Ah Monica, my star student.
МОНИКА: Yknow, you called me that before so II took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yum-yum-yum.
МОНИКА: Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and Im sorry, but I dont care.
НЕДРУГ: Okay Joey, youre up next. This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
ДЖОУИ: I can an A? In-in school? Hey, Im a dork.
МОНИКА: Joey! Im so proud of you!
НЕДРУГ: I think you should give him your star.
МОНИКА: Excuse me? He doesnt even know what hes doing!
НЕДРУГ: Were all beginners here. Nobody knows what theyre doing.
МОНИКА: I do! Im a professional chef! Oh relax! Its not a courtroom drama!
НЕДРУГ: If youre a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
МОНИКА: ImIm sorry, its just that umm Well II cook at this restaurant, Alessandros, and umm I just got a really bad review.
НЕДРУГ: Oh Alessandros! I love that place!
МОНИКА: You do?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes! Youre an excellent chef! As a person youre a little.
МОНИКА: Oh, Im totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
НЕДРУГ: Very much.
МОНИКА: Okay then, I dont stink. Im a good chef. Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont want to go. Im having fun.
НЕДРУГ: Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
НЕДРУГ: You mustve had your hands full.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That I did. That I did.
НЕДРУГ: So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My duties? All right.
НЕДРУГ: Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see.
НЕДРУГ: But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good to know.
НЕДРУГ: We can go into detail.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No dont I beg of you!
НЕДРУГ: All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?!
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely. You can relax you did great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Yknow Ive been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
НЕДРУГ: Poo?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall!
НЕДРУГ: Poo?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ill look forward to your call.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Youre back from your date!
РОСС: How are you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im fine, but thats not important. Whats important is how was she?
РОСС: Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
РОСС: Whats uh, whats going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No, shesShe was nice. I mean, shes a little slutty, but who isnt?
РОСС: I liked her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
РОСС: Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Its just that, Kate bothered me.
РОСС: Why? What was wrong with her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
РОСС: Okay, so whats the matter?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont want you to date her!
РОСС: Why? What, what are you jealous?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I dont want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know its a terrible thing to even think this, and its completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! Im very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: I wont date. Ill uh, Ill be here, with you, all the time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? But Im being so unreasonable.
РОСС: True, but youre allowed to be unreasonable. Youre having our baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you.
РОСС: Do you feel better?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, not really. Youre pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
РОСС: Uh Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Just one thing umm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
РОСС: We live together. Youre having our baby. Im not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you dont want something more?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I dont know, maybe. Im.
РОСС: Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin with you too!
РОСС: Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no-no, no!
РОСС: that you actually.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No thats justThats just cause Im such a good messer!
РОСС: Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
РОСС: The bathroom?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right!
ДЖОУИ: Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, and I didnt have to sleep with the teacher this time.
МОНИКА: Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
ДЖОУИ: What the hell!
МОНИКА: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
