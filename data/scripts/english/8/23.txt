РОСС: Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. Im Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
НЕДРУГ: Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Im sorry, semi-private? We, we asked for a private room.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we cant guarantee a private room and currently theyre all unavailable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, if only youd gotten here sooner.
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
РОСС: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Give her some money.
РОСС: I really think theyre out of rooms.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Theyre not! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
РОСС: Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?
НЕДРУГ: This is a hospital.

НЕДРУГ: Would you like to see a semi-private room?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
НЕДРУГ: Well youre only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. Itll be a while.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay.
НЕДРУГ: Ill be back in an hour to check you again.
РОСС: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
РОСС: Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! Never done this before.

НЕДРУГ: Hi. Is this your first?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah it is.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats so sweet.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Umm say, II opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
НЕДРУГ: No nonsense! Were all in this together.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think were gonna have some fun.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Oh, okay.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Smile!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I really dont want anyOh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross.

РОСС: Oh. Okay, just breathe.
НЕДРУГ: Oh honey, I think Im having one too!
НЕДРУГ: Look at this! There we go!
ФИБИ: Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
МОНИКА: Hey, you wanna see something?
ФИБИ: Sure! What?
МОНИКА: Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
МОНИКА: Listen uh, IIve been doing some thinking, and I dont know whether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: What-what-whats that now?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were ready.
МОНИКА: What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think were ready to have a baby now?!
ФИБИ: Oh, this is fun.
ДЖОУИ: Youre ready to have a baby? My boys all grown up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you said you were ready too.
МОНИКА: Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?
МОНИКА: Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
ДЖОУИ: What?! Are you crazy?!
МОНИКА: Thats it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
НЕДРУГ: I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
НЕДРУГ: Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
НЕДРУГ: Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I dont think well be doing that.
РОСС: Were not gonna do that.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
НЕДРУГ: Am I interrupting?
РОСС: Uh yes! Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh wait no.
РОСС: Later.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-dont! Dont leave me here with these people.
РОСС: Oh uh, Im sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
РОСС: Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. II wished youd called first.
НЕДРУГ: Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father.
РОСС: Oh good.
НЕДРУГ: I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
РОСС: Okay, whats up?
НЕДРУГ: I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
РОСС: Ma, youre asking me to marry you?
НЕДРУГ: This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
РОСС: Mom no, come on! Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: Just hear me out!
РОСС: N-no! Okay? Weve been through this! Were not gonna get married just because shes pregnant, okay?
НЕДРУГ: Honestly! Ross, this isnt just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
РОСС: Mom, yknow what? II cant deal with this right now. Im sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Justthink about it. If you dont, Ill talk more about humping.
РОСС: Gimmie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi dear!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
РОСС: she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why Im not with Rachel.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Why arent you with Rachel?
РОСС: Are you kidding? Look, were not gonna be together just because were having a baby. Okay?
ФИБИ: But yknow what? It just seems that you two belong together.
РОСС: Okay, stop it! I cant deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
ФИБИ: Right. And with who again?
ДЖОУИ: God. Hes crazy! Why doesnt he want to be with Rachel?
ФИБИ: I know!
ДЖОУИ: I mean seriously, shes like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadnt and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and I havent bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
РОСС: Hey. Whos that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: New people.
РОСС: What happened to the Disgustingtons?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Theyre having their baby! Its not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
РОСС: Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
РОСС: Yeah? Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Are you looking at her?!
НЕДРУГ: No!
НЕДРУГ: Dont you look at her you sick bastard!
НЕДРУГ: Honey I swear! I wasnt looking at her!
НЕДРУГ: Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
РОСС: Umm. Umm, ImIm just gonna
НЕДРУГ: See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
РОСС: No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
НЕДРУГ: You miss your girlfriend?
РОСС: Just ignore them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross.
РОСС: What? What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hes looking at me.
РОСС: Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
НЕДРУГ: Dont you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
МОНИКА: Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
МОНИКА: What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. Were good. Were really good.
МОНИКА: We are pretty good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But nothing has to happen until your ready.
МОНИКА: Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but maybe its right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!
МОНИКА: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im kidding. This is going to be fun.
МОНИКА: So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were trying to get pregnant. Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
МОНИКА: Okay, hold on a sec.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Period math?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Well, we could start trying. Now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right here?
МОНИКА: No, not here. Maybe here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and were in a building thats full of beds!
МОНИКА: And its so clean!
ДЖОУИ: Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
ФИБИ: Oh, it ate your money?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ФИБИ: All right, Ill see you downstairs then.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
ФИБИ: All right.
ДЖОУИ: Hey I got one! I got one!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Oh uh, up or down?
ФИБИ: Oh down please. II hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
НЕДРУГ: Could you press up too please?
ФИБИ: Sure! I feel so bad for you I broke my leg once too.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?
ФИБИ: Well, its a long story. Its kind of embarrassing. Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
НЕДРУГ: Car accident.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Me. Oh hey, thats me. Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah! II would like that.
НЕДРУГ: Im in the middle.
ФИБИ: Wait! What?! No! Elevator! No!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, you gotta press the button.
РОСС: The nurse said theyre bringing in another woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesnt need to be shell still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
РОСС: Thats it. Thats it.
НЕДРУГ: Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah it was.
НЕДРУГ: Mine havent been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. Oh, that was a big one!
ФИБИ: Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
НЕДРУГ: I think I know who youre talking about.
ФИБИ: Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, shes with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Drake who?
ДЖОУИ: Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information Im a doctor.
НЕДРУГ: A doctor at this hospital?
ДЖОУИ: Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?
ФИБИ: Hands.
ДЖОУИ: Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!
НЕДРУГ: Hes in room 816.
ДЖОУИ: 816, thank you!
ФИБИ: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: And what is his name?
ФИБИ: No!
МОНИКА: I think we found a place.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
МОНИКА: Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
МОНИКА: Okay. Lets hurryOh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine.
ФИБИ: Ooh, this is it! Oh, thats him! Thats him!
ДЖОУИ: Great! Go get him.
ФИБИ: Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
ДЖОУИ: Hes not really my type.
ФИБИ: No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
ДЖОУИ: But you said he was this great guy!
ФИБИ: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
ДЖОУИ: You do attract some stinkers.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dr. Long, Ive been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
НЕДРУГ: Three.
РОСС: Just three?! Im dilated three!
НЕДРУГ: We are moving along, just slowly. Dont worry, youre doing great. Ill be back soon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, yknow what? Im not waiting! Im gonna push this baby out! Im doing it! I mean its what? Three centimeters? Thats gotta be like this!
РОСС: Actually its more like this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh stupid metric system!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my. Were gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh for the love of God!
НЕДРУГ: Its coming! Its coming!
НЕДРУГ: And here it is!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh come on!
ДЖОУИ: Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
НЕДРУГ: Really? Ive been dealing with Dr. Wells.
ДЖОУИ: I know, but Im a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Wells is a woman.
ДЖОУИ: That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
НЕДРУГ: Clifford Burnett.
ДЖОУИ: Date of birth?
НЕДРУГ: November 16th, 1968.
ДЖОУИ: Age?
НЕДРУГ: Cant you figure that out based on my date of birth?
ДЖОУИ: Im a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
НЕДРУГ: Im 33.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. And uh, are you married.
НЕДРУГ: No.
ДЖОУИ: Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
НЕДРУГ: Are all the questions this personal?
ДЖОУИ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: Well uh if you must know Im a widower.
ДЖОУИ: Oh thats terrible. ImIm really sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
НЕДРУГ: No.
ДЖОУИ: Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?
НЕДРУГ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Oooh, wrong answer.
НЕДРУГ: This rooms available.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! Im next! Its my turn! Its only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you! Not this hospital, Im going to sue you! And my husband hes a lawyer!
РОСС: Uh Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go get back on that case honey!
НЕДРУГ: I dont think the next patient is very far along.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well then bring her in.
НЕДРУГ: OH. MY. GAWD!
НЕДРУГ: I.cant.believe this!
РОСС: And yet somehow its true!
НЕДРУГ: I mean this is so great! Were gonna be baby buddies!
РОСС: Squeeze your legs together and cover the babys ears!
НЕДРУГ: Hi sweetie!
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I dont think youve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologists office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
НЕДРУГ: I still cant believe it! Im the luckiest guy in the world!
РОСС: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Whatd he say?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yknow what? You have to speak very loudly when youre talking to Sid, because hes almost completely deaf.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
РОСС: Oh there you go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I get it!
НЕДРУГ: So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh we-we didnt.
РОСС: No-no. We.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all.
НЕДРУГ: Why?!
РОСС: Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Well then shut me up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just tell me how.
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
РОСС: Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
ФИБИ: What else? What else?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, well hes 33.
ФИБИ: Oh. Ah-uh.
ДЖОУИ: A widower.
ФИБИ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and hes not into anything weird sexually.
ФИБИ: Enter Pheebs.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers?
МОНИКА: We could, or we can have sex in it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
МОНИКА: Okay mister! Fertilize me!
МОНИКА: Does that sound like Janice?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If its not, then theres two of them. And that would mean its the end of the world!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hi.
МОНИКА: I cant believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
НЕДРУГ: Chandler Bing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: JanJanice!
РОСС: Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
НЕДРУГ: Its you. This is yours.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
ФИБИ: Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
НЕДРУГ: Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him.
ФИБИ: Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? Im sorry.
НЕДРУГ: No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.
ФИБИ: Oh, Ill get it.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
ФИБИ: Relax, its not like were forking.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
РОСС: Yknow what I think it is? I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
НЕДРУГ: Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
НЕДРУГ: Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
ФИБИ: Yknow what? This one is.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Thats the doctor who was in my room before!
ФИБИ: Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
НЕДРУГ: Im telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
ФИБИ: Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
ДЖОУИ: Rachels having her baby! Which is of no interest to me, Im a neurologist.
НЕДРУГ: That-thats him! You know him?
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay. IOkay ummthisII sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm yknow, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than Im coming off right now.
НЕДРУГ: I dont believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
ДЖОУИ: Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
НЕДРУГ: And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
ФИБИ: Youre right, that was wrong. Im sorry. Im so sorry. Its just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
НЕДРУГ: I dont think so.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brothers triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
ФИБИ: Uh Joey, were trying to dial down the crazy.
ДЖОУИ: Right!
ФИБИ: Umm, look we dont, we dont really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I dont know about you but that doesnt happen to me a lot.
НЕДРУГ: It doesnt happen to me either.
ДЖОУИ: Me neither.
НЕДРУГ: Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 54
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 3-2-1 oh!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cant. I cant push anymore, I cant.
РОСС: Sweetie youre doing great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God twenty seconds my ass!
НЕДРУГ: Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
РОСС: What? You do? You do? Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dont say, Oh my God! Oh my God what?
РОСС: What is that?
НЕДРУГ: Its the babys buttock, shes breech.
РОСС: Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
НЕДРУГ: Shes gonna be fine. Okay, shes in a more difficult position so youre gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
РОСС: Go!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel youre gonna have to push even harder, nothings happening!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry, I cant!
РОСС: Yes you can!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cant!
РОСС: Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Lets go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cant. Please, you do it for me.
РОСС: No! Come on letsOne more time! One final push! Ready? 123!
НЕДРУГ: Good!
РОСС: Keep pushing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you okay?
РОСС: You have no idea how much this hurts. Keep going! Keep going!
НЕДРУГ: Here we go!
РОСС: Oh! Oh! Shes upside down but shes coming! Shes coming!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God!
РОСС: Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God shes here.
РОСС: Oh shesshes perfect.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, shes so tiny. Whered she go?
РОСС: Oh its okay. Theyre just-theyre just wrapping her up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Well be careful with her, shes really tiny.
НЕДРУГ: Here she is!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, shes looking at me. Hi! I know you.
НЕДРУГ: Do we have a name yet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, not yet.
НЕДРУГ: Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, Baby Girl GellerGreen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello baby girl.
ФИБИ: Can we come in?
РОСС: Oh, come in.
ФИБИ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: There she is!
ФИБИ: Oh, shes so beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Shes amazing. Oh, oh Im so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its incredible, I mean one minute shes inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
ДЖОУИ: She looks so real! Yknow what I mean! Shes this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees anduh-oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so were good.
ФИБИ: Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! Youre so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I wont.
МОНИКА: Whats the matter?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh nothing I Sorry, I just cant stop crying.
РОСС: The doctor says its completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-youre sleep deprived.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I dont see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.
ДЖОУИ: Whats the matter now?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was reliving it.
ФИБИ: Ohhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, do you know what youre gonna call her yet?
ФИБИ: Oh, wait a minute its not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
РОСС: Uh actually, we-weve narrowed it down to two names.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and yknow what? I love them both, so why dont you just pick one and thatll be it.
РОСС: Wow! Umm, okay uheveryonethisis Isabella. What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats not her name! Im sorry, she just doesnt feel like an Isabella.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
ДЖОУИ: What was the other one Ross?
РОСС: Umm, Delilah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
РОСС: So I guess were back to uh, Baby Girl.
ФИБИ: Yay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well what are we going to do?
МОНИКА: Its okay honey, youll find a name.
РОСС: Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do?
МОНИКА: Yeah, Ive had them picked out since I was fourteen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnt it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well tell us! What are they?
МОНИКА: Umm, okay. If its a boy its Daniel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And if its a girl?
МОНИКА: I dont want to say.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, just tell us! Were not gonna want it!
МОНИКА: Okay. Its Emma.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Emma! See? I dont want it.
МОНИКА: Take it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: Its clearly an Emma.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, but you love that name.
МОНИКА: Yeah, but I love you more. Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing. So Im screwed. I mean Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, thats you. Youre our little Em. Oh whats that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was amazing.
МОНИКА: I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
НЕДРУГ: Yoo-hoo! Aaron LitmanNeurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
НЕДРУГ: Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Im fine.
НЕДРУГ: Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
НЕДРУГ: Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
НЕДРУГ: I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well ThatsyknowThatsWeve been alone for the last twenty minutes were doing okay. Besides yknow what? IIMaybe we wont be alone, cause lately IIthings have been happening between me and Ross, yknow? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Yknow? So it might be thethe beginning of something.
РОСС: Hey Janice!
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi!
РОСС: Whos this little guy?
НЕДРУГ: Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
РОСС: No-no. No.
НЕДРУГ: Im gonna leave the three of you alone.
РОСС: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. Yknow what I was, I was thinking about?
РОСС: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ummthat kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
РОСС: Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But wewe gotta be careful. Wewe cant let that happen again, yknow?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right.
РОСС: I mean we dont want to go down that road do we?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No, of course not. No. Thats why I brought it up. They didnt have any sodas?
РОСС: Oh my God! Im sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats all right. And so it begins.
ФИБИ: Is she in there?
РОСС: Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her.
ФИБИ: Oh!
РОСС: Look at Emma!
ФИБИ: I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
РОСС: Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel.
ФИБИ: Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again? No, I know. I know, because youre not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
РОСС: Itsits complicated okay?
ФИБИ: Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
РОСС: Look, weve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now.
ФИБИ: I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
РОСС: Yeah, exactly.
ФИБИ: Right. Or you might get everything youve wanted since you were fifteen.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time it is like a freak show up here. Whats the matter?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing.
ДЖОУИ: What is it? Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really its nothing. Im just.
ДЖОУИ: Rach come on, what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I guess so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, listen to me, listen to meyou are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise thats not gonna happen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
ДЖОУИ: You dont have to worry about that okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? Theyre right on that chair under Rosss coat.
ДЖОУИ: Sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: My God.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. Okay.
