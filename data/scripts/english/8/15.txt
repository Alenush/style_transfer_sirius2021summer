НЕДРУГ: Dana Klein Borkow Transcribed by: Dan Gottleib
ФИБИ: Oh! Hey, Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Hey, Happy Valentines Day!
ФИБИ: Oh, you, too.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, so, uh, hows it going living over at Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its good. Except he makes us watch the <i>Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. Ill see you guys later.</i>
ФИБИ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Theres one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
ФИБИ: Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. But maybe later.
ФИБИ: Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
НЕДРУГ: You want anything?
ДЖОУИ: You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentines Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that thats never going to happen!
НЕДРУГ: We have red bagels.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, okay.
ФИБИ: So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
РОСС: Oh, Im actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, shes been away all week visiting her parents, but shell be cool. I mean, shes been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, Fossils are my friends.
ФИБИ: Ugh. Come on, Mona, dont kiss ass.
РОСС: Uh, Im going to take off.
ФИБИ: All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
РОСС: What is it?
ФИБИ: Its a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
РОСС: All right. Candy and Cookie?
ФИБИ: Yeah. Candys the mother, Cookies the daughter. The fathers also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
МОНИКА: Phoebe, cmere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
ФИБИ: Oh, Monica, grow up!
РОСС: Hey, whats behind your back?
МОНИКА: Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebes opinion on for Valentines Day.
РОСС: You dont want my opinion?
МОНИКА: Not really.
РОСС: Come on, Im your older brother, ask me!
МОНИКА: All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
РОСС: The red one.
ФИБИ: Hey. Look, I know youve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
ДЖОУИ: No, Im not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
ФИБИ: He-hee!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
ФИБИ: This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
ДЖОУИ: Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy Valentines!
МОНИКА: Okay! Ill be right out. Im slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, just relax.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you, St. Valentine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Woah, woah, thats not pretty!
НЕДРУГ: Now, push!
НЕДРУГ: Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh! Make it stop!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am trying!
ДЖОУИ: Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, youre cute, but youre not too smart!
ДЖОУИ: Did I just throw this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, thats, uh, thats Phoebes friends dog. I dont know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but Ive got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously cant stop it.
ДЖОУИ: Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shes the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But we cant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre a guy. Well, you used to be.
МОНИКА: So what do you think?
МОНИКА: Ive still got it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why did you get me this?
МОНИКА: What is it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its yellingbleedingdilating. Oh, the dilating
МОНИКА: Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for Valentines Day.
МОНИКА: Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now.
МОНИКА: Honey, whats going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, remember the first time we saw<i> Jaws?</i>
МОНИКА: Mm-hmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How long it took to go back in the water?
МОНИКА: Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dont know. You didnt see it.
МОНИКА: Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
МОНИКА: Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, honey, theres
МОНИКА: Dont touch me!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
НЕДРУГ: Good.
РОСС: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: I brought you back a present.
РОСС: Wha? Oh, come on. You didnt have tosaltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. Thats not interesting.
НЕДРУГ: I think its interesting.
РОСС: I do too! I missed you!
НЕДРУГ: I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
РОСС: Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
НЕДРУГ: How exciting!
РОСС: Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasnt around when it happened for the first time.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no.
РОСС: Yeah, Im missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah right!
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: Joey cracks me up! Its like, Yeah, why dont you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldnt be awkward at all!
РОСС: Huhuh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!
НЕДРУГ: So, whatd you tell him?
РОСС: Just a second!
ФИБИ: How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
РОСС: I dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
ФИБИ: Taffy, really? Ive never had any.
РОСС: Ever?!
ФИБИ: Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, youre just never going to tell her?
РОСС: Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, Im going to take her to an amazing Valentines dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks Im the best boyfriend in the world, then Im going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
ФИБИ: If I havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? Whats the deal? Oh, its nice! May I try a pink one?
ДЖОУИ: So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
ФИБИ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog? Youre subdued. Did you give him a beer?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ФИБИ: Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
ФИБИ: Hes miserable! What happened to him?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
ФИБИ: What stuff?
ДЖОУИ: Rachel stuff.
ФИБИ: OhJoey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
ДЖОУИ: Hes breathing!
ФИБИ: Okay, Im going to take him back to Wendys.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look! Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
РОСС: Well, Im, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
РОСС: Yknow, its interesting! Most people think thats made with seawater, when in fact
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
РОСС: Mona? What arehi! What are you doing here? Im, um, supposed to pick you up!
НЕДРУГ: Change of plans, I made you a special Valentines dinner! Surprise!
РОСС: Ayyyayyyy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hey, Mona!
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! Whats she doing here?
РОСС: I have no idea!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ill be watching TV if anybody needs me.
НЕДРУГ: Seriously, what is she doing?
РОСС: Uhlately, she just likes hanging out here.
НЕДРУГ: Why?
РОСС: I think shes lonely.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, but its Valentines Day!
РОСС: I know.
НЕДРУГ: Cant we just ask her to go?
РОСС: No, no. Shes way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im not here! Thats just my Chinese food!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
РОСС: Mm-hmm. Shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what Im going to do? Im going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
РОСС: And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why dont you, uh, open the champagne, and Ill be right back. Ive got a surprise for you.
НЕДРУГ: You got another ex-wife back there?
РОСС: Please start drinking!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im just going to grab the phone.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you dont take this the wrong way, but, but, um what are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Im sorry! Do you need the phone?
НЕДРУГ: No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why dont you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But, but, Mona, I live here.
РОСС: Happy Valentines Day! Or something to remember me by.
МОНИКА: How long has it been this time?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 90 seconds.
МОНИКА: Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all I did was think about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
МОНИКА: Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can do that.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
МОНИКА: Oh, thank God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I know!
МОНИКА: Come in!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Im so sorry to barge in on your Valentines, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
МОНИКА: Oh, my God.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Poor Ross.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
МОНИКА: Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, now, wait. Now Im all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
МОНИКА: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone!
МОНИКА: Shes rightof course not. Honey, get the tape.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why have I seen this thing three times?!
МОНИКА: Itsstill beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh! Its horrible!
МОНИКА: I know! I know, Im so sorry for you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait, you guys, look!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Did her ass explode?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, the babys out! Look, look!
МОНИКА: Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And look how happy the mom is now!
МОНИКА: OhRach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, screw you guys, you dont have to do it!
РОСС: Hey, hey, man!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, whats up?
РОСС: UhMona just dumped me.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?
РОСС: Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
ДЖОУИ: Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day.
РОСС: Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentines Day? Whats going on, huh? Girl trouble?
ДЖОУИ: Sort of.
РОСС: Really?!
ДЖОУИ: You dont have to seem so happy about it.
РОСС: Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, II d
РОСС: Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Yknow, actually onceonce I got dumped during sex.
РОСС: Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
ДЖОУИ: Forget about it. Its no big deal.
РОСС: Cmon! Joey! What is it?
ДЖОУИ: Its nothing.
РОСС: Hey, hey, its me. Why cant you tell me?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, uhsit down. Um theres this woman that I like. A lot. But, uhit cant happen.
РОСС: Shes not a Tribbiani?
ДЖОУИ: No!
РОСС: I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
ДЖОУИ: Yes.
РОСС: Well, uh, does she like you?
ДЖОУИ: Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because I cant do anything about it.
РОСС: Why not?
ДЖОУИ: Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends.
РОСС: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?
ДЖОУИ: No. I dont think so.
РОСС: Okay. Um is he a good guy?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, hes the best.
РОСС: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I dont know.
РОСС: Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
ДЖОУИ: I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I
РОСС: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
НЕДРУГ: Heres your warm milk.
РОСС: Im going touhIm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah.
РОСС: Anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
ДЖОУИ: Its Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: <i>Youre going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! </i>
НЕДРУГ: I came to the big city to become a star! Ill doanything to make that happen!
НЕДРУГ: Anything?
