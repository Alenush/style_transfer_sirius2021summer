РОСС: Hey! What are you guys looking at?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, its a poster for that World War I movie that Im in, check it out.
РОСС: Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh! I know. Im coming soon to a theater near you! Im in THX! Im unsuitable for children!
РОСС: Now I cannot wait to see this.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, its already generating Oscar buzz.
ФИБИ: I started that!
ДЖОУИ: I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and youre all invited!
МОНИКА: Are we gonna take a limo?
ДЖОУИ: Sure! Why not?!
МОНИКА: Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well obviously I wont be able to come, for those of you who havent checked their calendars today is my due date. Well yknow, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great youve been during this time. I really couldnt have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
РОСС: Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You. Like you havent done enough.
РОСС: Look, II know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
ФИБИ: Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea? Oh God, get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lets.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Cause Ill do it.
МОНИКА: What are you doing here so early?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They sent me home from work. They were like, Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby. Well yknow what? Screw em! If they dont want me there, Ill just hang out with you guys.
ФИБИ: Or you can do volunteer work.
ДЖОУИ: Hello?
НЕДРУГ: Joey! Its Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
ДЖОУИ: One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. Youll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. So thats it?! I only get to bring one guest?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? Hello?
ДЖОУИ: Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what about me?
ДЖОУИ: You said you didnt want to go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because Im pregnant you think Im invisible.
ДЖОУИ: Definitely not invisible.
МОНИКА: Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes out. You snooze you lose.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.
МОНИКА: Well then somebodys snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I havent seen this dress.
МОНИКА: Star in a movie.
ФИБИ: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe.
ДЖОУИ: Well uhI think I want to take Chandler.
ФИБИ: PhoebePhoebePhoebePhoebeBurrrrr!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You really want to take me?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So youre never actually going to pay me back?
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots youre gonna take him? Joey, I dont think youre comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
ДЖОУИ: Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. That means a lot to me.
ФИБИ: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
ДЖОУИ: Im gonna go shave.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah well, Im gonna go spit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I have to pee. If I dont come out in five minutes its because Ive choked to death on the potpourri stink.
ФИБИ: When she comes out, you hold her nose, Ill blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her.
МОНИКА: Shes over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
ФИБИ: I dont know. II think its still gonna be a while.
МОНИКА: Hmm, care to make it interesting? Ill bet you that shell have it by this time tomorrow.
ФИБИ: Youre on!
МОНИКА: Okay, how much?
ФИБИ: One hundred thousand dollars!
МОНИКА: How about fifty bucks?
ФИБИ: Fine! Ill call Zurich and move some money around.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, whos turn is it to help me get up!
ФИБИ: No ones here! Oh damnit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
ДЖОУИ: A little tall.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its just so glamorous.
ФИБИ: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Im sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
МОНИКА: Damnit! Damnit! Heres your fifty bucks!
ФИБИ: Its interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
МОНИКА: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
ФИБИ: Fine! Youre on!
МОНИКА: Okay.
ФИБИ: Until then, General Grant, why dont you set up camp right there.
РОСС: Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctors appointment.
МОНИКА: Shes in the bathroom.
РОСС: Rach, we gotta go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: In a minute!
РОСС: People ask me why were not together, I just dont know what to tell them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, all right. Lets go!
РОСС: Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctors keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, Im fine.
РОСС: Really? You dont think thats a little inappropriate.
ФИБИ: Good God man dont anger it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
РОСС: Fine! Fine! Yknow what? Whatever you want. Okay? Youre the mommy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh uh-uh pal! Dont call me mommy! Its bad enough you call your own mother that.
МОНИКА: Im actually with her on this one.
ДЖОУИ: I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, this is it. Its my big fight scene coming up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross.
РОСС: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I ask you something?
РОСС: Uh-huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When Carol was pregnant with Ben.
РОСС: Mmm?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: were you this irritating?
РОСС: Wow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me?!
РОСС: Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, youve been a little short with me lately. Im not trying to irritate you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
РОСС: Yknow what? The doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak until then.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! Thats great!
РОСС: Yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
РОСС: Oh, youre nice to her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She has the drugs!
НЕДРУГ: Well do a quick check.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: So, eight days late huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: You must be a little uncomfortable.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eh, just a tad.
НЕДРУГ: Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
РОСС: Do them!
НЕДРУГ: Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we are ready to try anything.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: You can take some caster oil, theres eating spicy foods.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great! We will do all of those.
НЕДРУГ: taking a long walk, and then theres the one thats proved most effective: sex.
РОСС: Youve got to be kidding me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
ДЖОУИ: You liked it? You really liked it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Which part exactly?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The whole thing! Can we go?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
ДЖОУИ: You fell asleep! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
МОНИКА: Hey!
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
РОСС: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks that, That will open up a can of worms.
МОНИКА: Well what is it? What is it? If its gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
РОСС: Its sex.
МОНИКА: Do it!
РОСС: Monica!
МОНИКА: Im just saying its been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
ФИБИ: Oh II dont know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
МОНИКА: All right, lets be practical, if Ross isnt willing to do it, hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow ChandlerChandler is good!
РОСС: Monica, what is the matter with you?
МОНИКА: Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? Why today?
МОНИКА: Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and I dont want to lose again!
РОСС: What?! While shes been going through this hell, youve been making money?! Youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ill take that bet.
РОСС: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Im miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
РОСС: Can I get some of that action?
МОНИКА: Wait a minute! Now Im betting against all three of you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, dont worry. I really do feel like tomorrows the day.
МОНИКА: Oh, okay!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Sleeping beauty!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im so sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!
ДЖОУИ: Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money.
ДЖОУИ: Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont know, five hundred dollars?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you want a calculator?
ДЖОУИ: Please!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here!
ДЖОУИ: All right, what else?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes.
ДЖОУИ: Which were still keeping under our hats!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
ДЖОУИ: What the hell are you talking about, The south will rise again man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, money well spent!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Okay, so Im writing you a check forSo you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
РОСС: Come on, finish your enchilada.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross IWe tried all the spicy food. Its not working.
РОСС: Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! Soso hot! Oh my By the way, you dont want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
РОСС: Stop it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know whats gonna work! Its doctor recommended!
РОСС: Im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, Im dying.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh come on Ross, weve done it before well do it again, itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
РОСС: This is insane, Im not gonna make love to you just so that youll go into labor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Make love? What are you a girl?
РОСС: Always a great way to get in a mans pants.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
РОСС: I love when you talk dirty to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know it. Youre right. Thats not sexy. OhOh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!
РОСС: Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Ross! Im miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
РОСС: Yknow what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: Forget it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow! What now Ross youre not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean youd think the damn jalepeno wouldve cleared up your sinuses, but no! Thats not enough What are you doing?!
РОСС: Im getting that baby out of you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God!
РОСС: Oh, I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
РОСС: I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Were having a baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didnt uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to.
РОСС: Not so much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Two hundred.
ФИБИ: Thank you!
МОНИКА: Thats it. Im done. I dont care when the baby comes, no more betting.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
ФИБИ: Is Rachel having the baby?
МОНИКА: How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler! Its time!
ФИБИ: Theyre at the coffeehouse.
МОНИКА: You know everything! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you its a girl.
ФИБИ: We know its a girl!
