НЕДРУГ: Shana GoldbergMeehan Transcribed by: Eric Aasen.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh myGod! Let me see that!
ДЖОУИ: You fall for it every time!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ФИБИ: I brought you my old maternity clothes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Pheebs thats so sweetOoh, those are so cute!
ФИБИ: Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the babys born, theyre great for shoplifting melons.
МОНИКА: Oh good youre all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four oclock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
МОНИКА: He was in Rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I dont remember him. Honey, are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
МОНИКА: No that was Jarred! Wow! I havent thought about him in a long time Anyway, umm Wills, Wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so I invited him here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thats nice.
МОНИКА: Oh, and by the way, hes lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: I just want you to say it once in a while.
МОНИКА: All right okay, just so you know, Im not gonna make a turkey this year.
ДЖОУИ: What?!
МОНИКА: Well Phoebe doesnt eat turkey.
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals!
ДЖОУИ: No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious!
МОНИКА: All right! Okay, its just Phoebe. Wills still on a diet, Chandler doesnt eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachels having her aversion to poultry.
ДЖОУИ: She is?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
МОНИКА: Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
ДЖОУИ: But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
МОНИКА: All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
ДЖОУИ: No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
МОНИКА: All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
ДЖОУИ: Thats right! Cause Im a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
МОНИКА: Hey, isnt weird to think about how next year at this time theyll be a little baby at the table? Rachels! But good to know where youre at!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Happy Thanksgiving!
МОНИКА: You too!
ФИБИ: Anything I can do to help?
МОНИКА: Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but hes really into the game so I dont want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
ФИБИ: Sure!
МОНИКА: Im gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! Were not at a barn dance. Youve gottayou wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
ФИБИ: Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So hows the game?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have no idea.
ФИБИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont have to help out with stuff.
ФИБИ: I dont believe you! That isbrilliant! And Monica has no idea?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
МОНИКА: Is your team winning hon?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! Anderson just scored again! Theres no Anderson.
ФИБИ: Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I dont think I can help you after all, I didnt realize this game was on.
МОНИКА: Oh, I didnt know you liked football.
ФИБИ: Well normally I dont, but yknowGreen Bay is playing.
МОНИКА: You like Green Bay?
ФИБИ: Well its only like my favorite bay! Actually, its not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J.
МОНИКА: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Happy Thanksgiving!
МОНИКА: Aww thanks! God Will Im so glad that you came! You look great! You mustve lost like.
НЕДРУГ: 150 pounds. Yeah, Im gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
МОНИКА: A pie!
НЕДРУГ: Oh right. All right, its no fat, its no sugar, its no dairyits no good. Throw it out.
МОНИКА: You wanna meet some people? This is uh this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey. Id shake your hand but uh Im really into the game. Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to each other.
МОНИКА: This is Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Hey. Wow! Well done.
МОНИКА: Wanna give me a hand?
НЕДРУГ: Sure! Monica, I cant get over how great you look! You look stunning!
МОНИКА: Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!
МОНИКА: Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
НЕДРУГ: Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
МОНИКА: Good. And Rachel Green too.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Is there a problem?
НЕДРУГ: Nope. Uh, its okay. Its just uh, God I hated her.
МОНИКА: What?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? No Will no!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow, its been a while since weve screamed something. Maybe we should.
ФИБИ: Oh okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on!
ФИБИ: Noooo! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!
МОНИКА: Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, youve got almost an entire turkey to eat.
ДЖОУИ: Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin chips is like stretching.
МОНИКА: All right.
ДЖОУИ: Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full.
НЕДРУГ: I actually know what youre talking about. Im here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
ДЖОУИ: Who the hell is this guy?
МОНИКА: Will! From high school.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey!
МОНИКА: Joey.
НЕДРУГ: Hello.
РОСС: Will!
НЕДРУГ: Ross!
РОСС: Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff?
НЕДРУГ: Its good to see you man.
РОСС: Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
НЕДРУГ: Im a commodities broker.
РОСС: Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, its not. But Im rich and thin.
РОСС: Oh! Man I dont think Ive seen you since uh, Lance Davis graduation party.
НЕДРУГ: That was such a fun night!
РОСС: Yeah. It wouldve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: So what do you, what do you do now?
РОСС: So how long are you in town?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey sweetie. Oh good.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel Green.
РОСС: Awoh, thats right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, IllIll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
РОСС: Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
НЕДРУГ: Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God Monica, who is that?
МОНИКА: Thats Will from high school!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, hes Look at the way hes just staring at me. I think hes trying to mouth something to me, but I cant make it out.
МОНИКА: Okay, dinners ready!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good game!
ФИБИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
МОНИКА: Oh, so who won?
ФИБИ: Green Bay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Detroit.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green BayMermen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Will, right?
НЕДРУГ: Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Im Rachel Green.
НЕДРУГ: Oh II remember you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! Arent you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis graduation party?
НЕДРУГ: You are unbelievable.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you!
МОНИКА: Uh Rachel? Rachel, why dont you sit here? And Will you sit way over there.
ДЖОУИ: Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
МОНИКА: This is Chandlers chicken. This is the turkey.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. How-how big is that?
МОНИКА: About nineteen pounds.
ДЖОУИ: Its like me when I was born.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, youd like that wouldnt ya?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Oh yknow what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
НЕДРУГ: Typical.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry. What?
НЕДРУГ: I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.
ДЖОУИ: Seriously, who is this guy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, Im sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
НЕДРУГ: I dont know? Do I? Do I?
ФИБИ: I think you do.
МОНИКА: Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
НЕДРУГ: A little mean? You made my life miserable!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ImImI had no idea. Im sorry. I.
НЕДРУГ: Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
МОНИКА: Oh Will. But you-youve worked so hard.
НЕДРУГ: Yams!
МОНИКА: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh Will umm, I just want to say that Im real sorry for whatever II did to you in high school.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it wasnt just me. We had a club!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You had a club?!
НЕДРУГ: Thats right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
НЕДРУГ: Me and Ross.
РОСС: No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
НЕДРУГ: Yes he was.
РОСС: No. No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So who else was in this club?
РОСС: Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but II dont think he-he knew what it was.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
НЕДРУГ: You went out with her?! We had a pact!
РОСС: That was in high school! Its not like it was binding forever.
НЕДРУГ: Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
МОНИКА: I swear I didnt. Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
РОСС: Look Rach IIm sorry, okay? II was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined.
НЕДРУГ: Co-founded!
РОСС: co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
НЕДРУГ: Well, we did a little more than that.
РОСС: No-no! No-no. No-no.
ФИБИ: What?! What else did you do?
НЕДРУГ: We started a rumor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What rumor?
ФИБИ: Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross!
РОСС: It was no big deal. We-wesaid that the rumor wasthat ummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Thats right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: You started that?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! You heard that?!
МОНИКА: Everyone at our school heard it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! Oh my God! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldnt go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
РОСС: Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that ones not really our fault.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, how come you never told me this?!
МОНИКА: I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey stop staring! Theres nothing there! Its not true!
ДЖОУИ: Im afraid Im gonna need proof.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: You are my Everest.
МОНИКА: Joey, you dont have to finish that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yes I do. Otherwise whats next? Today Im just a guy who cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow Im the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I justI justI gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, Dear Rach, youre such a good person. Not girl! Person!
РОСС: Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dear Rach, youre a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie.
РОСС: Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes!
НЕДРУГ: Could you also tell them Im skinny now?
МОНИКА: Oh! Me too!
РОСС: Well look-look Im not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Yknow what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
МОНИКА: Thats not totally true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: What?
МОНИКА: Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
РОСС: How did you know that?!
МОНИКА: Its true?!
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
НЕДРУГ: Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka CiKek the night before he went back to Thailand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
РОСС: Hey! She didnt look 50!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she look 16?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
ФИБИ: Oh! Wow!
РОСС: She didnt photograph well!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
ФИБИ: So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
РОСС: I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace.
МОНИКА: Didnt she walk with a cane?
РОСС: Only when it was damp! I cant believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Yknow what? Im back in the club!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ФИБИ: I wanna join!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: WhPhoebe!
ФИБИ: Im sorry. Im sorry. I never got to be in a club. II didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, yknowFine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!
МОНИКА: All right, listen youre just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow.
МОНИКА: And Ross, if it werent for Rachels rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
РОСС: As a romancer of the elderly.
МОНИКА: Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
РОСС: The eyesdid still sparkle.
МОНИКА: Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-youve been through so much since then. And right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Cant you just let this go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shes right.
РОСС: Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
НЕДРУГ: Hold on! You got her pregnant?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Are ya getting married?
РОСС: Nope.
НЕДРУГ: So you knocked her up but youre not gonna marry her. Dude! Anybody?
ФИБИ: Okay. Its exactly how Id imagined it would be.
ДЖОУИ: All right wheres that turkey!
ФИБИ: Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
ДЖОУИ: Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
ДЖОУИ: Well thats it. Im done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
МОНИКА: Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
ФИБИ: Is there anything we can do for you?
ДЖОУИ: No just, nobody press on my stomach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You can keep those pants by the way.
ДЖОУИ: Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
МОНИКА: Yeah, you want some?
