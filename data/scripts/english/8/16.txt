НЕДРУГ: Andrew Reich amp Ted Cohen Transcribed by: Eric Aasen.
НЕДРУГ: Previously on Friends.
ДЖОУИ: Theres this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, its complicated.  Shes with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, yknow?  Ccause were really good friends.
РОСС: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, hes the best.
РОСС: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I dont know.
РОСС: Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
ДЖОУИ: I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I
РОСС: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
ДЖОУИ: Its Rachel.
РОСС: Did you umIm sorry, did you just say its Rachel?
ДЖОУИ: Yes.
РОСС: Um, youyou like Rachel?
ДЖОУИ: Yes. I like Rachel.
РОСС: Rachel?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, yknow, yknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnt get said enough. I like you Ross.
РОСС: But RRRachelRachel?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but its not a big deal.
РОСС: Its not a big deal? Oh, Im sorry I justum, Iwhat about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I likeyou-you cant stop thinking about her. Like how you cant sleep?
ДЖОУИ: Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
РОСС: Rachel whos carrying my baby? Rachel?
ДЖОУИ: Look no, II know its bad, and I know its wrong. Okay? But-but its not like anythings ever gonna happen. Yknow? These-these are just feelings, theyre gonna go away.
РОСС: Yknow what? II gotta go.
ДЖОУИ: Oh come on Ross! Hey RossRoss dont.
РОСС: I justyknowII just have oneRachel?!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Shes growing inside you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow that was a big one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
ФИБИ: Oh hey you guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, and you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.
ФИБИ: Okay, good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
ФИБИ: Well last night, I met Monicas.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, dont be crazy. You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, whats he like?!
ФИБИ: Well hes tall.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: He has brown hair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course, of course.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
ФИБИ: He works with food!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh sure. Older?
ФИБИ: Obviously, and hes British.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I was just gonna ask!
ФИБИ: Yeah? And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
ФИБИ: Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
ФИБИ: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РОСС: Hey.
МОНИКА: I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were.
РОСС: Oh yknow, I stillI cant believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean its Its like you and me going out, only weirder!
МОНИКА: All right, I know youre hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but dont say that again.
РОСС: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then hed be the stepfather of my child.
МОНИКА: Honey, I dont think thats something we need to worry about! First of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how shed react.
РОСС: Sure, because women never like Joey. Yknow, I think hes a virgin.
МОНИКА: Joeyhes not even thinking about going after Rachel!
РОСС: Hes not?
МОНИКА: No! All hes thinking about is how youre taking this! I mean, listen its totally freaking him out. Hes talking about moving to Vermont.
РОСС: Why?
МОНИКА: He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
РОСС: Hate him? I No, I dont hate him. Its just its Rachel, yknow?
МОНИКА: Honey I cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I dont want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that youre still his friend.
РОСС: Okay. Okay, Ill talk to him.
МОНИКА: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
ФИБИ: Oh! Hi!
МОНИКА: Hi!
ФИБИ: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hello. Hello.
ФИБИ: Soul mate.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ФИБИ: Soul mate.
МОНИКА: So, what have you guys been doing?
НЕДРУГ: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
МОНИКА: I know! What is this, 1985?!
НЕДРУГ: Thats exactly what I said. Phoebe, isnt that strange.
МОНИКА: Not really.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
МОНИКА: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
НЕДРУГ: Well, Octavio, 27 amp 7Oh! And theres this great little place, Alessandros.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Thats my restaurant, Im the chef there.
НЕДРУГ: Youre kidding me!
МОНИКА: No!
НЕДРУГ: Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
МОНИКА: Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing?!
ФИБИ: Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
ФИБИ: Theyre just talking, and yknow what? Just because I think theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, good work.
ФИБИ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: Yeah! Oh hes great, I love him.
ФИБИ: Dont worry, well find you someone else.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
РОСС: No, I dont want to hit you.
ДЖОУИ: Oh what then? Kick me?
РОСС: No.
ДЖОУИ: Bite me?
РОСС: No, no I dont want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that Im not mad at you andand that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh nowHey RossRoss! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
РОСС: Uhyeah sure.
ДЖОУИ: Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I dont.
РОСС: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? II would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
РОСС: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over her, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never been in love before so.
РОСС: What?! Youre in love with her.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I thought you knew that.
РОСС: Umm, no.
ДЖОУИ: Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I dont want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, Ah, Ill get over this. Yknow? I justIt just keeps gettin harder. I dont, I dont know what to do. Yknow? What do I do?
РОСС: I think you need to tell her how you feel.
ДЖОУИ: Okay thats the green stuff talkin.
РОСС: No, Im serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if shes not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
ДЖОУИ: But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut.
РОСС: If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it shouldnt stand in the way.
ДЖОУИ: Are you sure?
РОСС: Yeah. Look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldnt find a better guy. So.
ДЖОУИ: Hey thanks.
РОСС: So when do you think youre gonna talk to her?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
РОСС: Im understanding, but lets not get carried away.
ДЖОУИ: Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say? Oh!
РОСС: Yeah, tell me about it.
НЕДРУГ: so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, Im one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
МОНИКА: Me too! Yeah, Chandler cant stand it. He wont even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
НЕДРУГ: And youre still married to him?
МОНИКА: You know what Id love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheeseNot even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries And pate. Oh, Im really not high, its just I used to be fat.
НЕДРУГ: Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a great little villa you can stay at.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it made of cheese?
НЕДРУГ: No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldnt that be incredible?!
МОНИКА: Id move in tomorrow!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
ФИБИ: Im so sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do we do?
ФИБИ: I dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I dont know how you fight that.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey? Whats up?
ДЖОУИ: I uh, I just came by because II want to talk to you about something.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay whats up?
ДЖОУИ: Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well honey, Im late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
ДЖОУИ: Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner with you tonight. Thats all.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Thats good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what youre gonna say. Good. Yeah. Dont you people ever knock?!
МОНИКА: Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here, browsing through the personals.
МОНИКА: Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect! But good enough.
МОНИКА: Jeez! What is with you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im sorry, did you say cheese?
МОНИКА: All right, whats going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. But Im sure tomatoes does.
МОНИКА: I dont believe in soul mates either.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dont?
МОНИКА: No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?
МОНИКА: No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you.
МОНИКА: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean Im really worried the babys not going to like him. Are you okay?
ДЖОУИ: What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reasonIs it hot in here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater?
ДЖОУИ: I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. Wow, I wouldnt think Hobbs would like that so much.
ДЖОУИ: Uh How long have we known each other?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, sevene-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh, long time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: But over the past few weeks.
НЕДРУГ: Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight.
ДЖОУИ: Actually uh, could you give us a second?
НЕДРУГ: Sure. Sure. Seconds up! Notthat kind of table.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you were saying?
ДЖОУИ: Im not quite sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, Eight years. And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and ummnow here we are.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in love with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Im falling in love with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who are you talking too? Oh, youre kidding! Oh, its a joke! Its funny. Its funny. I dont get it. Oh. Okay. Umm IIuh, wow. Are you uh How did umm When?
ДЖОУИ: Does it really matter?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
ДЖОУИ: Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I.
ДЖОУИ: But.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I think Im gonna go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Joey please! Please dont! Please dont leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
ДЖОУИ: Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, cause then youre gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I?
ДЖОУИ: Sure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Joey honey I dontI dont want to lose.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im so sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no Rach, please, dont be sorry. Okay? Dont be sorry. Yknow I was only kidding you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, that was a real good one.
НЕДРУГ: Is this your table?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: God, youre gonna be here all night!
НЕДРУГ: I know! I havent even read them the specials yet!
НЕДРУГ: Whats the matter with them?
