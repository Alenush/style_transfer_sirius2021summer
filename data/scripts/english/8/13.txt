НЕДРУГ: Vanessa McCarthy Transcribed by: Eric Aasen With Help From: Dan Gottleib.
ДЖОУИ: All right. Its a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you dont feel that now. It was crazy! Youre fine. Youre better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everythings normal! Shes just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, sweetie.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, its your girlfriend, Rachel!
МОНИКА: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you, are you high?
МОНИКА: I just had the most amazing bath.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? I dont like baths.
МОНИКА: Wait, you like them with me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, its not the bath I enjoy, its the wet, naked lady.
МОНИКА: Oh, baths are so relaxing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
МОНИКА: How dirty do you think I am? Im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, its 2:00 on a Wednesday and Im watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? II really need to talk to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
ДЖОУИ: Well, neither.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, whats up?!
ДЖОУИ: I dont know. Its-its justlately, Ive been feeling Okay, heres what it is You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no, no you dont, just come back.
ДЖОУИ: All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you?
ДЖОУИ: It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In London?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
ДЖОУИ: You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Oh, Ross, dont forget, we have that doctors appointment tomorrow!
РОСС: Right.
ФИБИ: Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
РОСС: No-no, we talked about it. We dont want to know. All we care about is that its happy and healthy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
РОСС: And smart!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Popular.
РОСС: With an aptitude for science.
ФИБИ: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! Ive come up with a bunch of ideas!
РОСС: Really? Me too!
ФИБИ: Me too!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?!
ФИБИ: Uh huh! If its a girl, Phoebe, and if its a boy, Phoebo!
РОСС: Maybe. But it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, RachRach, what were you thinking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! I was thinking if its a girl, how about Sandrine? Its French.
РОСС: Huh. Thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay fine, what do you have?
РОСС: Well, OK, its for a boy. Well, I know its a little out there, butDarwin.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
ФИБИ: Yeah, by Sandrine.
РОСС: Youre just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im really, really not.
ФИБИ: How-how about you each get five vetoes?
РОСС: All right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right.
РОСС: That sounds fair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I dont think youre going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If its a girl, Rain.
РОСС: Veto.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?
РОСС: Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
ФИБИ: I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
РОСС: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, why do you hate our child?
РОСС: Fine, you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, James.
РОСС: Huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But only if its a girl.
РОСС: Oh, veto. How aboutOoh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Im sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
РОСС: Veto. Stewart?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Veto. Sawyer?
РОСС: Veto. Helen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Veto.
ФИБИ: Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sex on the balcony?
МОНИКА: No, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is it?
МОНИКА: I drew you a bath!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, I dont like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
МОНИКА: Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! III lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, this does butch it up a bit.
МОНИКА: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
МОНИКА: Absolutely.
МОНИКА: Bet I know how that discussions going to go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat.
МОНИКА: So?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im going to need a bigger boat.
РОСС: I dont think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
НЕДРУГ: Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
РОСС: Uh, no. No, were not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether its a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
НЕДРУГ: Thats right. But if you dont want to know.
РОСС: No, no, we want to wait, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. Right.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Ill be right back. And, uh, I know its really not my place, but please dont name your child Phoebo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
РОСС: What? Rach! Come on, thats terrible! Theyreuhtheyre babies. Theyre-theyre all beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Third one from the left?
РОСС: Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows Im talking about it. Dont-dont youWhWhaHey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: Youre looking!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didnt!
РОСС: I saw you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay fine, I did. But I didnt see anything, I swear.
РОСС: Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, but Ross just listen to me.
РОСС: No, no, no, no! Dont tell me! I dont want to know!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I couldnt even if I wanted to, because I dont know! I swear I didnt see anything, and I dont want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
РОСС: Momentary lapse. Dont-dont you have any self-control?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
МОНИКА: Hello?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theres something wrong.
МОНИКА: You know what? II think Ill wait out here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im in the bathtub.
МОНИКА: Oh. Whats wrong?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The bath salts! Theyre starting to effervesce! Its different. Its interesting.
МОНИКА: Okay, lets talk about something else.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
МОНИКА: Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I had the exact same conversation.
МОНИКА: You did? What was he talking about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont know! Joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
МОНИКА: That was a long night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, lets break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
МОНИКА: Okay, he was talking about rules.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: Umm, and looking at people differently.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He didnt say anything about that to me.
МОНИКА: What did he tell you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
МОНИКА: Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But what did he mean by rules?
МОНИКА: Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because he was looking at her differently.
МОНИКА: And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
ФИБИ: You guys?
МОНИКА: Just a minute! Thats Mrs. Tribbiani!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dont say anything.
МОНИКА: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im not going to let you say anything.
МОНИКА: You just stay here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, God!
ФИБИ: Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
МОНИКА: Oh, you had that?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
ФИБИ: Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: Nothing.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: I mean, II, I really shouldnt say. I mean, Im really not supposed to.
ФИБИ: Fine.
МОНИКА: Its a humdinger!
ФИБИ: Then its really too bad that you cant tell me.
МОНИКА: Somebody likes you!
ФИБИ: Is it Chandler?
МОНИКА: No!
ФИБИ: Well, then tell him to stop staring!
МОНИКА: Its Joey!
ФИБИ: Really?! Joey?! You dont say.
МОНИКА: Is it something youd be interested in?
ФИБИ: I dont know, I dont know, I dont know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But yknow on the other hand No. No, I cant. Were friends. No, oh, no. I dont want to risk what we have.
МОНИКА: I guess that makes sense. So, you think youre going to talk to him?
ФИБИ: Sure, yeah. I mean, its Joey. I dont want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
МОНИКА: Not Chandler, just Joey.
ФИБИ: Sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what? Ive been thinking about it. Im really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
РОСС: Rach, II cant tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know were never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know its a boy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didnt see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
РОСС: I dont think so! Youre just giving me Ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wouldSequoia?
РОСС: Veto.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine.
РОСС: Unless You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, Im not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
РОСС: Not like this!
ФИБИ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Well, whats up?
ФИБИ: Umm, Joey, I know.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ФИБИ: I knooow.
ДЖОУИ: Whaaat?
ФИБИ: I know about your feelings.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. You do?
ФИБИ: Yes, and Im sorry. II know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but thats very rare.
ДЖОУИ: I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, its Rachel for God sakes.
ФИБИ: For God sakes, its Rachel!
ДЖОУИ: I know. I know. And shes not only my friend shes my pregnant friend! Shes my pregnant friend whos Ross ex!
ФИБИ: Yeah thats Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
ДЖОУИ: What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, yknow? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I dont like about her. You want to hear it?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: She made me switch to light Mayo. Thats it! Thats all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
ФИБИ: Joey, I just think youre getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
ДЖОУИ: You think?
ФИБИ: Absolutely! Yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, just a crush! Thats all this is! Its a crush! Im Joey I dont get deep feelings.
ФИБИ: Thats right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know Ive had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And Im sure youve had them for us.
ДЖОУИ: Not really.
ФИБИ: Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
РОСС: So, I uh I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: Thats right. The student has become the master.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I swear, I dont know.
РОСС: Oh, come on, you know its a girl!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A what?!
РОСС: You really didnt know?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Were having a girl?
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats what you just said!
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You said girl!
РОСС: Yes. Im Im sorry. Im so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im not! Were having a girl! Sometimes I cant believe its with youBut still! Were having a girl!
РОСС: I know! I know. You know what? Im putting Ruth back on the table!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yes! Well have ourselves a little baby Ruth.
РОСС: Permission to veto.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, please.
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do I smell essential oils?
МОНИКА: Yeah, Im going to take a bath. Im just going to get a magazine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: What do you think youre doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: L-leaving my troubles behind?
МОНИКА: I know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed.
МОНИКА: Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now youre just a girl in a tub!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You told her?!
МОНИКА: She pulled it out of me! Shes like a conversational wizard! Howd it go?
ФИБИ: Well, you were wrong, he doesnt like me!
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didnt like you? How would you feel?
МОНИКА: I dont think Id care.
ФИБИ: Really? Lee Majors is hot!
ДЖОУИ: Hello?
ФИБИ: Were in the bathroom!
ДЖОУИ: Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because its a relaxing and enjoyable time!
ДЖОУИ: What are you guys doing in here?
МОНИКА: Oh my God! A friend hes looking at differently, but its wrong. Its Rachel!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You like Rachel?!
ДЖОУИ: Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
ФИБИ: Mazel tov.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
МОНИКА: Honey, cover it up with the boat!
РОСС: Hello?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes were all in here and we would love for you to join us!
РОСС: Well hey! Whats going on? Ooh, cool boatOh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I was waiting for you!
ФИБИ: Tell us what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Were having a girl.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: IllIll get you later!
ДЖОУИ: All right. Its a new day, and its just a crush, thats all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, it was cuckoo! Everythings going to be fine. Its just a crush.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, sweetie.
ДЖОУИ: I love you.
МОНИКА: It sure is nice to do this together, isnt it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. And what youre doing feels so good.
МОНИКА: Im not touching you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Youre not?
МОНИКА: Its the salts.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
