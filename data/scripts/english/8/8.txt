НЕДРУГ: Andrew Reich amp Ted Cohen Directed by: David Schwimmer Transcribed by: Eric Aasen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
ФИБИ: Sure. Yeah, hes kinda sexy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, no, Ill be there too.
ФИБИ: Okay so, well just come up with some kind of signal if its going well you can take off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I havent told him Im pregnant yet.
ФИБИ: Oh. Why not?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cause I know hes gonna flip out and I hate it when hes angry.
ФИБИ: Oh Rachel, this is all so Papa dont preach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again hed make me eat the entire pack.
ФИБИ: Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
ФИБИ: Gosh. Im not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
МОНИКА: No you dont!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No you dont.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Monica! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette party!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Her what?!
ФИБИ: Your secret bachelorette party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You had a bachelorette party?!
ФИБИ: She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought we werent gonna have bachelor bachelorette parties! Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
ДЖОУИ: Its a grand tradition!
МОНИКА: Im sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well you couldve untied it with your hands.
ДЖОУИ: This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You went home with the waitress.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
МОНИКА: Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
НЕДРУГ: How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
ФИБИ: Oh, II dont eat meat.
НЕДРУГ: Its chicken.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I dont eat that either.
НЕДРУГ: Ill never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell mewhat is new with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well actually umm.
НЕДРУГ: Your 74 Lafite sir.
НЕДРУГ: 74?! I ordered the 75! Thats a magnificent wine! The 74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why youre a waiter?
НЕДРУГ: This is why I told the manager I wouldnt wait on you tonight!
НЕДРУГ: Oh come on! Dont be such a baby!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: In case you didnt notice, that is a scary man.
ФИБИ: Hes right though, the 74 is absolute piss.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This was such a huge mistake. I cant tell him Phoebe. I cant, I cant, I cant, I cant.
ФИБИ: Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No its okay, this is whats gonna happen. Im gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
ФИБИ: Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, that is thebabys problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
НЕДРУГ: I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Umm, I got TiVo.
НЕДРУГ: Whats TiVo?
ФИБИ: Its slang for pregnant.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe!
НЕДРУГ: Are you really pregnant?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Who is the father? Oh no! Please dont tell me its her!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, its Ross. Its Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope youre okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. Youre gonnaThis is your first grandchild! Youre gonna be a poppy!
НЕДРУГ: Thats true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Poppy. Oh, Im gonna be a poppy. So when is the wedding?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who?
НЕДРУГ: The wedding! Theres going to be a wedding. Young lady, dont you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: February 2nd!
НЕДРУГ: So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
РОСС: Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no, II had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and yknow take it all in.
РОСС: Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
НЕДРУГ: So, I gotta get going.
РОСС: Okay, IIll see you tonight.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Okay, bye.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My God! You must be good in bed!
ДЖОУИ: So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. Hows it going?
РОСС: Ah, its good. Its going good. I mean, we get along great. Shes, shes so.
ДЖОУИ: Hot?
РОСС: Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?
РОСС: Well II havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.
ДЖОУИ: Im gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a stripper.
ДЖОУИ: Will you let the lady talk?!
МОНИКА: Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much better.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore.
МОНИКА: So dont think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aa two month anniversary present.
РОСС: Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
МОНИКА: Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And Joey.
МОНИКА: Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
РОСС: Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
ДЖОУИ: Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby.
ФИБИ: Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour.
ФИБИ: Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong.
НЕДРУГ: I just called a friend of mine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! The Plaza?! Oh daddy! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
НЕДРУГ: What is it sweetie?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry daddy.
НЕДРУГ: I dont believe this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
НЕДРУГ: Stay calm?! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?! Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?! Thats it! Is that it?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
ДЖОУИ: So you uh, nervous about getting married?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.
ДЖОУИ: How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Youre right, this is more fun.
ДЖОУИ: Thats her! Okay, come on!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, that-thats-thats me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats me.
ДЖОУИ: Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
НЕДРУГ: So is that a bedroom?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah right over there.
НЕДРУГ: All right, whenever youre ready.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was weird.
ДЖОУИ: Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
НЕДРУГ: Im waiting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So shes a.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, thats one naked hooker!
НЕДРУГ: I love your place! Where is this guy from?
РОСС: Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
РОСС: So much more.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
РОСС: Aw forget it, its from Pier One. Sorry.
НЕДРУГ: You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!
РОСС: Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
НЕДРУГ: So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
НЕДРУГ: You got Rachel pregnant?!
РОСС: Who did?!
НЕДРУГ: You did!
РОСС: Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
НЕДРУГ: Oh? Really? Thats what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
РОСС: No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careII love Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
НЕДРУГ: Oh really? Thats how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
РОСС: Hey! I offered to marry her!
НЕДРУГ: Wh.
РОСС: But I didnt want to.
НЕДРУГ: Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
НЕДРУГ: Tramp?!
РОСС: Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
ДЖОУИ: Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Maam, are you also a stripper?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but thats gonna cost extra. Okay, heres the extras, handcuffs, spanking.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.
ДЖОУИ: I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
НЕДРУГ: Do you mind if I smoke in here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh actually, Id rather youYeah, go ahead. Were gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
НЕДРУГ: How could you have kept all of this from me?
РОСС: I was going to tell you, but.
НЕДРУГ: But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
РОСС: Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just Why dont we just let the machine get that?
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
РОСС: No! No! No! No! No! IIIII need to, I need to lie down.
НЕДРУГ: So, tonights the night of the big bachelor party?
МОНИКА: Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girls number.
НЕДРУГ: No problem. So whos the party for?
МОНИКА: My husband.
НЕДРУГ: You hired your husband a hooker?
МОНИКА: Shes a stripper.
НЕДРУГ: No, shes a hooker.
МОНИКА: Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
НЕДРУГ: When theyre hookers.
МОНИКА: Oh my God Stu! II cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?
НЕДРУГ: Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would she do that?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is the worst bachelor party ever!
НЕДРУГ: Whats taking you boys so long?
ДЖОУИ: In a minute!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?!
ДЖОУИ: All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why me?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Its your bachelor party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which is why you should do it.
ДЖОУИ: I dont want to. You do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do it!
ДЖОУИ: You do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
ДЖОУИ: I miss this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont think weve actually done this before!
ДЖОУИ: No, II miss hanging out with you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well wewe still hang out.
ДЖОУИ: Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its likethings are different.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well yknow, things are different. ImIm married now.
ДЖОУИ: Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I justI misshanging outjust-just us, yknow?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what from now on well make time to hang out with each other.
ДЖОУИ: You got it. Come here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
МОНИКА: Shes a hooker! Shes a hooker! Shes a Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
РОСС: So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no.
ФИБИ: Id better go. Just over here: I dont want to miss the fight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross Im so sorry. Okay. II will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
РОСС: I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?
РОСС: Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. IllIllIllIll talk to her.
РОСС: Okay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Thank you!
ФИБИ: Thats it?! You call that a fight? Come on! We were on a break! No we werent! What happened to you two?!
РОСС: Thank you so much for coming back over.
НЕДРУГ: Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
РОСС: Focus.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
НЕДРУГ: How can I be sure on that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh we justwe drove each other crazy!
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
РОСС: Trying to date this woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
РОСС: Probably shouldnt touch me.
НЕДРУГ: Yknow, III justI dont want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.
РОСС: Should I leave this open for you too?
НЕДРУГ: Im not sure yet. Why didnt you just tell me about all this?
РОСС: Because whats going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
РОСС: I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachels father. Look II made a mistake, but its only because I really, really like you. Really!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I guess you canclose the door now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. Hes a good kisser isnt he? Im going!
МОНИКА: I swear I didnt know she was a hooker! I mean whDid you let her smoke in here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
МОНИКА: Yknow what? Im gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper, and youre gonna get a stripper.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica! Wait!
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Carry on.
МОНИКА: Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think Ill take them off.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could you not narrate?
МОНИКА: Gotcha sailor.
НЕДРУГ: just because youre not in love with the guy you cant.
ФИБИ: Wow, you told your dad the truth.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: About an hour ago.
ФИБИ: Wanna go see a movie?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Bye daddy.
НЕДРУГ: theres gonna be a wedding! Thats unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love! constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
