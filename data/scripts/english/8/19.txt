РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, Im in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.
ДЖОУИ: Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. Thats me! Im blank!
МОНИКА: How cool is this?! We know three down! Im touching three down!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah you are baby.
МОНИКА: Three down knows Im married, whats three down doin?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So did they call you to tell you your names gonna be in this?
ДЖОУИ: No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
РОСС: Whyd you say no?
ДЖОУИ: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If onlythere was something in your head to control the things you say.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I dont know, gal pal Rachel Green?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that gal pal spelled LOSER?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, dont listen to him. Please?
ДЖОУИ: Fine! All right, Ill do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I yknow, start to say something stupid.
РОСС: Just then or-or all the time, cause we-we have jobs yknow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! Im gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
МОНИКА: You think were being obvious?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, were just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
НЕДРУГ: Yknow I think its great you wanted to meet here. Yknow when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
ДЖОУИ: Actually, I didnt know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldnt have mattered, Im doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
НЕДРУГ: Can I get you anything?
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Ill have a cup of coffee.
ДЖОУИ: And Ill have all the muffins.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Shhh! Were not talking.
ФИБИ: Oh. Finally! Oh.
НЕДРУГ: So, according to your bio, youve done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything youre particularly proud of?
НЕДРУГ: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
НЕДРУГ: And there is Kevin.
НЕДРУГ: This is the first time hes ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
НЕДРУГ: So this is it? Victor?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I guess it is. And so Im gonna get on this spaceship, and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne babyIm gonna want to meet her.
ДЖОУИ: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I doso I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice work my friend.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am.
ДЖОУИ: Well, there are so many things, its hard to pick just one.
ФИБИ: Im gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, Id actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
РОСС: Uh, double latte, extra foam.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And a bagel with only.
ФИБИ: I was just being polite!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, how about when youre not working. What do you do in your spare time?
ДЖОУИ: Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That isthe Coast Guard.
ДЖОУИ: What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
ДЖОУИ: Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
РОСС: Come on, it's fun!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
ДЖОУИ: Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn.
ДЖОУИ: I think youre right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, ready?
ДЖОУИ: One.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Two.
НЕДРУГ: Three.
ДЖОУИ: Thats kinda nice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, thats kinda a relief.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna see if we still have it?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: FREE PORN!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have free porn here!
ДЖОУИ: In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And Im also a mento for the kids. Yknow a mento, a role model.
НЕДРУГ: A mento.
ДЖОУИ: Right.
НЕДРУГ: Like the candy?
ДЖОУИ: Matter of fact, I do.
НЕДРУГ: Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
РОСС: Are you serious?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
РОСС: Wow! We are pretty good at this!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, II, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whats wrong with you?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!
ДЖОУИ: No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its a trifle. Its got all of these layers. First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
РОСС: It tastes like feet!
ДЖОУИ: I like it.
РОСС: Are you kidding?
ДЖОУИ: Whats not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooood.
ДЖОУИ: The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats still in there?!
ДЖОУИ: Not anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stick to your side!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, come on now!
ДЖОУИ: All right, what are we havin?
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.
НЕДРУГ: Your muffins.
ДЖОУИ: Ill take those to go. For the kids.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
ДЖОУИ: It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said. But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
НЕДРУГ: Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I said that I.
ДЖОУИ: You guys, this is Shelley, shes interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Im gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, Im the one you come too. This might be Joeys baby, who knows? Im just kiddingSeriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
РОСС: Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Im gonna just go get this warmed up.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Joey! Youre doing great!
РОСС: Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mento?
ДЖОУИ: No thanks.
НЕДРУГ: So, as Joeys friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
РОСС: Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, thats gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well II would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of ourlives.
ФИБИ: Umm, II just think you dont expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! I like that. Whats your name?
ФИБИ: Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
НЕДРУГ: How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
ФИБИ: Oh okay, its P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in Ello there mate!
НЕДРУГ: Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
РОСС: Yeah, you too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You too!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks.
МОНИКА: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
ДЖОУИ: How come you have two? Chandler: Well this one's for you. Joey: Get out. Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Chandler: That's what they'll call us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey! Sorry!
ДЖОУИ: No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
ДЖОУИ: Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Look!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ive never lived like this before.
ДЖОУИ: I know.
ДЖОУИ: All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
РОСС: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
ДЖОУИ: All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
ФИБИ: Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
ДЖОУИ: Judge rules, no violation.
ФИБИ: Ohhh.
ДЖОУИ: And the duck gets the NutterButter!
ФИБИ: No! Hey-hey that's not a NutterButter, that's just an old Wonton!
ДЖОУИ: Judge rules, NutterButter.
ФИБИ: Ohh, tough call.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Id seen this thing on The Discovery Channel.
РОСС: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you. Ewwww! You peed on yourself?!
НЕДРУГ: Ewwww!
МОНИКА: You cant say that! You-you dont know! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway II tried, but II couldnt bend that way. So.
НЕДРУГ: Ewwww!
ДЖОУИ: Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you!
ДЖОУИ: Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
НЕДРУГ: So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
ДЖОУИ: Really? Me? Wow! I dont even know any huge gay people!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
НЕДРУГ: Now, off the record, youre not.
ДЖОУИ: What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
РОСС: Your make-up!
РОСС: Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so were face to face or-or should I climb down your back so were-were butt to face.
ДЖОУИ: I think face to face.
РОСС: I would say that.
ДЖОУИ: Face to face, yeah!
РОСС: Okay, here I go.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?!
РОСС: I prefer not to answer that right now, Im still carrying a little holiday weight.
ДЖОУИ: Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think we thought it all the way through.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
ФИБИ: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Youre turning into a woman.
ДЖОУИ: No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now Ive upset you? What did I say?
ДЖОУИ: Its not what you said. Its the way you said it Oh My God, Im a woman!
ДЖОУИ: Great nap.
РОСС: It really was.
ДЖОУИ: Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
НЕДРУГ: So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, Hey, how you doin?
ФИБИ: Oh, please!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how you doin?
ДЖОУИ: Hey! How you doin?
НЕДРУГ: He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
ДЖОУИ: Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, is Rachel here? Im her sister.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Jill!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, Rachel!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, introduce us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is Chandler.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you know Monica and Ross!
РОСС: Hi Jill.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And thats Phoebe, and thats Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how you doin?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dont!
НЕДРУГ: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
ДЖОУИ: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
НЕДРУГ: I don't think so.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I do. How you doin?
НЕДРУГ: I'm okay.
ДЖОУИ: What?!?! Oh dear God!
ДЖОУИ: Not much to tell there Im really shy.
НЕДРУГ: So, thats it. I guess thats all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
ДЖОУИ: Oh great! Great! Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Bye-bye. I did it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
РОСС: Amazing! Amazing!
НЕДРУГ: Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, whats your favorite soap opera?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I dont watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, yknow?
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, good to know. So close!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I cant believe they didnt put it in the part where you said you didnt watch soap operas.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
МОНИКА: You slept with her didnt you?
ДЖОУИ: Little bit, yeah.
РОСС: Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, thats just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
РОСС: Did you just wink at me?
