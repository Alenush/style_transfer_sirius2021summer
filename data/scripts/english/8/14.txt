МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Pheebs, whats up?
ФИБИ: You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Youre getting a massage! You never let me massage you!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, I can explain!
ФИБИ: You told me you hate massages!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningDont let Phoebe in.
ФИБИ: I cant believe this! How long as this been going on?

РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I hope its not an inappropriate time to say this but, youre the best sex I ever had.
ДЖОУИ: Thats always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Joey!

ДЖОУИ: Oh, yknow what? Maybe uh, youyou should come to me. Im a not, Im not wearing any bottoms.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mia Hamm!
ДЖОУИ: Oh thats amazing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh! One hand on the sheet Joe!
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey babe.
МОНИКА: Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing they dont like us do they?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
МОНИКА: No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about to the street say from the balcony?
МОНИКА: Why dont we just find a place for it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. How about in that cabinet?
МОНИКА: No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about the closet by the bathroom?
МОНИКА: Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. Its locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
МОНИКА: No reason. II keep private things in there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yknow, Ive been living here a while and Ive never seen whats inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
МОНИКА: Feminine stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
МОНИКА: Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youll let it go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine.
МОНИКА: Thank you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Love you.
ФИБИ: Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, If it helps!
ФИБИ: Why wont you let me massage you?
МОНИКА: Well itsI mean Id justId be self-conscious. Youre my friend Id be naked.
ФИБИ: Monica! We lived together for years! Ive seen you naked!
МОНИКА: Thats different, we were roommates! And when?!
ФИБИ: Im curious about the human body.
МОНИКА: Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
ФИБИ: But Im a professional! And Im really good! Look, if youre uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
МОНИКА: Okay, if it means that much to you.
ФИБИ: It does! How would you feel if you couldnt share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldnt teach us about dragons.
МОНИКА: Dinosaurs.
ФИБИ: Potato, potaato.
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
РОСС: What?! It is?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
РОСС: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping.
ДЖОУИ: A dreamless sleep.
РОСС: My God, the babys kicking. Thats great. Although Ikinda wish II wouldve been there to feel the kicking for the first time yknow.
ДЖОУИ: Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
РОСС: Look, II dont want to miss anymore baby stuff. SoHere. Heres my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! Ill be there! Okay? I dont care if its three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
ФИБИ: Are you under the sheet?
МОНИКА: Yes.
ФИБИ: Great, lets begin. Hows the pressure?
МОНИКА: Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
ФИБИ: Stating the obvious, but thank you. And its not weird is it.
МОНИКА: No. Ooohh.
ФИБИ: Thats right, you just enjoy.
МОНИКА: Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Oh God Phoebe! Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wasnt trying to open your closet! I wasnt trying to open your closet! I swear!
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it.
ДЖОУИ: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?!
ДЖОУИ: I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
ДЖОУИ: Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And here we go.
ДЖОУИ: I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa!
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Absolutely. But, were gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? Ill page Ross on the way. Come on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh GodOw!Oo!
ДЖОУИ: Okay RachRachRach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! So?
НЕДРУГ: Shes fine. Shes experiencing BraxtonHicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it youve had one of these Braxton thingies?
ДЖОУИ: So but everything is normal.
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely.
ДЖОУИ: And-and theres no danger to her and the baby?
НЕДРУГ: No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you dont know what they are, but shes fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
ДЖОУИ: Calm?! I wasnt calm! Ive never been more scared in all my life!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
ДЖОУИ: Well what do I know?! Im not a doctor!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But IBut everything is okay. Im fine!
ДЖОУИ: You sure?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctors uterus though. Mild discomfort, whats he talking about?
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey-hey!
РОСС: Is everything okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, everythings fine!
РОСС: Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
ДЖОУИ: Something called BraxtonHicks contractions.
РОСС: Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women dont even feel them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh, whats with the candy?
РОСС: Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
РОСС: No IMona!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I gotta go back in there.
РОСС: What? Why? Whats wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, everythings fine. I just gotta go back.
РОСС: No really, you tell me whats up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: II forgot my underwear.
РОСС: So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey, dont worry about it man. Dont worry about it, no big deal.
РОСС: Yeah but still, I mean it shouldve been me. Im the dad.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, if you have any questions, heres some information on BraxtonHicks. Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. Youre gonna make a wonderful father.
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There has got to be a way!
ДЖОУИ: Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-old girl.
ДЖОУИ: Then why do you throw like one?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
ДЖОУИ: Sure. Monica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face. By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats a good idea.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I justI feel terrible.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, its not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Yknow? Youre doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card?
МОНИКА: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
ФИБИ: No-no, I got that.
МОНИКА: So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay but you should know though, Ive raised my rates to 200 an hour.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ФИБИ: I mean 500.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: 600.
МОНИКА: Whats going on?
ФИБИ: Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
МОНИКА: What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!
ФИБИ: Really? Theres nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
МОНИКА: Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!
ФИБИ: No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
МОНИКА: Really?!
ФИБИ: Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.
МОНИКА: Are you sure?
ФИБИ: Yes.
МОНИКА: I guess.
ФИБИ: Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
РОСС: Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Thats so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
РОСС: Well yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross!
РОСС: What?! What?! Rach what?!
ДЖОУИ: Whats going on?
РОСС: I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
ДЖОУИ: Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
РОСС: IIm sorry Rach, I didnt know. Are you gonna be okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Ill be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
ДЖОУИ: Im on it!
РОСС: I cant believe this! I shouldnt be the one making her throw up!
ДЖОУИ: Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
РОСС: Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I dont know any of it and Im the father. I wish Id be more involved yknow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whats up?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you breaking up with us?
ДЖОУИ: The thing iscause I live with Rachel Im here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And RossRoss is missing everything. So.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you two should live together.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatif youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanOr he does.
РОСС: No III would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Ross, its you and me!
РОСС: So? Sure! But it-it wouldnt be anything romantic. And ImIm dating MonaDamnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
ДЖОУИ: All right now, so? What do you think?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont know. Is it crazy?
РОСС: No! No its not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
ДЖОУИ: Well, I was due.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, lets do it. Ill move in.
РОСС: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Oh Rach thats great. Thats great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfusing my wifes tools. Oh my God!
МОНИКА: How did you get in there?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Youre messy.
МОНИКА: Oh no! You werent supposed to see this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I married Fred Sanford!
МОНИКА: No Chandler, you dont understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? Im yknowIm sick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, honey youre not sick! Look, I dont love you because youre organized, I love you in spite of that.
МОНИКА: Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
МОНИКА: Wellits just ummIm afraid you might mess it up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you okay?
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding me? Im great! Yeah, Im uh Im better than great. I am good. And now that shes gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnt do before. Yknow? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Yknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Yknow? I like being on my own, Im uh, better off this way. Im uh, a lone wolf. Yknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
МОНИКА: Ohhh.
ФИБИ: Thats it. Just relax.
МОНИКА: Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
ФИБИ: Come on more!
МОНИКА: Oh God!
ФИБИ: Yeah, you like that dont you?
МОНИКА: Oh yeah right there!
ФИБИ: You want it there? You take it there baby!
МОНИКА: Uh Phoebe?
