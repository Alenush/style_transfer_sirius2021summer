ФИБИ: Hey! I got you a present!!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
ФИБИ: I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs you didnt have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang
МОНИКА: I love it! Its huge!! Lets open it! Open it!!
ФИБИ: Its a <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> machine!!
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: I didnt know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
МОНИКА: Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay.
МОНИКА: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I kinda like it here.
ФИБИ: Do you really like it?
МОНИКА: Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is likeOh my, this is like my second favorite game!
ФИБИ: Oh really? What was your first?
МОНИКА: Well I-I really dont remember the name of it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well what did it do?
МОНИКА: Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A vending machine?
МОНИКА: Dont feel bad for me! I won like every time!
РОСС: Hey! Oh, Im so glad you guys are here. Ive been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
ДЖОУИ: Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
РОСС: Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They made you head of the department!
РОСС: No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didnt I get head of the department?
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its really romantic.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, great! Thanks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the <i>Four Seasons</i> for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancingOh! Take her dancing!
ДЖОУИ: You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, yknow what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh?
ДЖОУИ: Why dont I take you out?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
ДЖОУИ: Yes I do! And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.
ДЖОУИ: Ill be fun.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right?
ФИБИ: No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
МОНИКА: Okay, Im next. Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
МОНИКА: Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who cares? Its a stupid game.
МОНИКА: You only think its stupid because you suck at it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.
ФИБИ: Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
МОНИКА: No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why do you want to play this game so bad?
ФИБИ: Yeah! Its not like it spits out a <i>Clark</i> bar after every game.
МОНИКА: Okay. Phoebe thats it. Come on, get outout of the chair. Get out! Oh comePhoebe!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
ДЖОУИ: No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, its just bag. Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like Im going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.
ДЖОУИ: Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, sonice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to <i>Playboy</i>, my kind of woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
ДЖОУИ: I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
ДЖОУИ: Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hm-mmm.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
РОСС: which brings us back, of course, to Greelys theory of dominance. Okay, that-thats all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, its the new building on Avenue A.
РОСС: What?! That-thats all the way cross town, Im supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, dude. Thats not gonna happen.
РОСС: Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! Im the teacher!!
РОСС: Hello. Im sorry Im a little late. AhWhoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, Im Professor Geller. Good job today.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
НЕДРУГ: Theres a side of steamed vegetables.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
ДЖОУИ: Yknow what? Bring her both, and Ill have the same.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good dateOh, I almost forgot. I didnt pay you the rent check.
ДЖОУИ: Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? Were on a date.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
ДЖОУИ: No! No. Umm, just myself and if they dont like me for Im sorry I couldnt even get through that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
ДЖОУИ: Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. And that works?!
ДЖОУИ: Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you poor little famous man.
ДЖОУИ: Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but youre so beautifulI dont think I can.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
ДЖОУИ: Alright, soso tell me one of your moves.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright. So whered you grow up?
ДЖОУИ: Thats your move? Boy Rach, youre lucky youre hot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, just answer the question!
ДЖОУИ: Queens.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And so were-were you close to your parents?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why not?
ДЖОУИ: I dont know. I guess theres just always been this distance yknowI mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Its gotta be rough.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it is. Its really tough. Yknow sometimes I thinkWow!! Nice move!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh?
ДЖОУИ: "Whered you grow up," its so simple!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! And now if youll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And now youre watching me walk away.
ДЖОУИ: Yes I am! Again so simple!
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are not going to believe what I did today!
МОНИКА: Well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they dont.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
МОНИКА: What is the matter with your hand?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words.
МОНИКА: Chandler, why would you do that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because its awesome.
МОНИКА: You think this is clever?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
МОНИКА: Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is when you put it together with that one.
МОНИКА: Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, he wont even know what they mean.
МОНИКА: Chandler! Hes seven; hes not stupid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have you talked to him lately?
МОНИКА: All right, look Im just gonna unplug it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no, if you unplug it, Ill have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, its still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
МОНИКА: Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: With the claw?!
МОНИКА: All right fine. Fine, Ill do it. Ive just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pull my fingerMy hand is messed up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am not gonna answer that!
ДЖОУИ: Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No one! They are my friends, I wouldnt punch any of them.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but I dont know why. Look at me, Im having such a wonderful time!
ДЖОУИ: Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know!
ДЖОУИ: I never laughed so hardDid you see the wine come out of my nose?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
ДЖОУИ: I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
ДЖОУИ: Huh. Huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, now dont judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. Im ripping into this swan.
ДЖОУИ: Ah! Okay, well then you dont judge me. Im gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So tell me, what are Joey Tribbianis end of the night moves?
ДЖОУИ: Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How do you do that?
ДЖОУИ: Now you cant tell anyone, but uhI put on shiny lip balm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, like a moth to a flame, Im telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I dont want to tell you.
ДЖОУИ: Why not?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because its embarrassing.
ДЖОУИ: More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didnt say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when were at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesnt sound like anything, but I swear it works.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. WhyYeah, that would work for ya
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Yeah. Me to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
РОСС: No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, why didnt you just take a cab?
РОСС: Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets itll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well youre not gonna be able to keep doing this.
РОСС: Well I have to. Okay? If I dont, theyll take the class away from me. AndI already put it in my family newsletter.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You what?
РОСС: Youve seen it, the Geller Yeller.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. Wow!
РОСС: Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, Im sure I can make it this time. I justI just cant be afraid to get a little bithit by cars.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie <i>Cujo</i>?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, I still cant believe you havent seen <i>Cujo</i>. What is wrong with you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Relax! Its not like its <i>Citizen Kane</i>!
ДЖОУИ: Have you ever tried to sit through <i>Citizen Kane</i>?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I know its really boring, but its like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting <i>Cujo</i> sometime.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah? All right, lets do it tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well dont you have that big date tonight?
ДЖОУИ: Oh right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont know! Im-Im kinda thinking it-it was the lobster
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah me too, all night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
МОНИКА: Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i>. Its gotRight Well, youre just a little bitch, arent you?
ФИБИ: Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
МОНИКА: Theyre all Chandler.
ФИБИ: Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did. But it came at a price.
МОНИКА: But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
РОСС: Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! Im on time! Okay, why dont we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. Okay, umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
ДЖОУИ: No-no! Im fine. Its just Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that youve known for a while and then suddenlysuddenly see them a different way?
НЕДРУГ: You mean like from behind?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Yeah, thatthats exactly it. Youre right. Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Ew, yknow what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
ДЖОУИ: Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what Im talking about.
НЕДРУГ: Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
МОНИКА: Oh my God Phoebe, youre on fire!
ФИБИ: I know!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: One more score to go! You can do it!
ФИБИ: Dont touch me!!
МОНИКА: Dont touch her!!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
ФИБИ: I cant!! I cant!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
РОСС: Phoebe!!
ФИБИ: Oh hi BenNo!! Dont look at the machine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God! Thank God youre home! Im watching <i>Cujo</i>.
ДЖОУИ: Alone?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, did you get to the part where theyre trapped in the car and Cujos throwin himself at the windshield?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No! Seriously, whats wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, it didnt work out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yknow, I never thought Id say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
ДЖОУИ: Oh sure, yeah, why not?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay, thats him! Thats him! Thats Cujo! Thats Cujo!
ДЖОУИ: All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now? I cant watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Arent you scared?
ДЖОУИ: Terrified.
РОСС: So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs
