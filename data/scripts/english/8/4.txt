ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together. 
МОНИКА: You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! You’re back! 
МОНИКА: Hi sweetie! 
ФИБИ: Come on in! 
ФИБИ: So how was the honeymoon? 
МОНИКА: Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back. 
ФИБИ: That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger. 
МОНИКА: No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with. 
МОНИКА: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people? 
МОНИКА: This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship. 
ФИБИ: Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance… 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We really…didn’t get a chance to… 
ФИБИ: You have got to be kidding me! 
МОНИКА: We didn’t get anything for anyone. 
ДЖОУИ: Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace! 
МОНИКА: That you can have. 
НЕДРУГ: Tradition was broken here as there were no commercials immediately after the opening credits, just more show.} 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hello! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Welcome home. 
РОСС: So, how was the honeymoon? 
МОНИКА: It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture! 
МОНИКА: Oh great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines! 
МОНИКА: All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen? 
ФИБИ: Monica! That’s not right! Start with where. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: You’re welcome buddy. 
РОСС: Yeah, thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me. 
РОСС: Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is? 
РОСС: The lie you just told. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That-that you came on to me? 
РОСС: There’s the one! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But you did! I mean, let’s be honest. 
РОСС: Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who. 
ДЖОУИ: Whom. That’s right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know you kissed me first. 
РОСС: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was sending you signals? 
РОСС: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. 
РОСС: Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now? 
РОСС: Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No please, show me how I begged you! 
РОСС: I can show you, I have it on videotape! It’s an expression. 
ФИБИ: I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know who has a great video camera? 
ФИБИ: Greg and Jenny? 
МОНИКА: Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let’s call ‘em. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! 
МОНИКА: Hello? Eighth street deli? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place. 
МОНИКА: Uh sorry, wrong number. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here you go. 
МОНИКА: Hello? It’s the deli again! 
ДЖОУИ: All right! I’ll have a sandwich! 
МОНИКА: I don’t think this number’s right! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: You got fake numbered. 
МОНИКА: What?! People don’t do that! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh I think we do. 
МОНИКА: They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked al l those insightful, great questions. 
МОНИКА: And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot! 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects. 
РОСС: Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door! 
ФИБИ: Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert! 
РОСС: Okay, listen I am not a pervert! 
ФИБИ: That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that! 
РОСС: Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. 
ДЖОУИ: Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know. 
РОСС: About…about sex? That I hadn’t had sex in months? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about. 
РОСС: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom? 
РОСС: I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, for like months? 
РОСС: Five to be lying, six. 
ДЖОУИ: Six months? Whoa that’s rough. 
РОСС: Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky. 
ДЖОУИ: The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday! 
РОСС: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty. 
РОСС: Really? Well then tell it to me. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story. 
РОСС: I’ll try to control myself. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe… 
РОСС: You were backpacking across Western Europe? 
ДЖОУИ: Have a nice six more months Ross! 
РОСС: Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and? 
ДЖОУИ: I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying… 
РОСС: Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, this is great wine. 
РОСС: It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
РОСС: Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. 
НЕДРУГ: I studied for a year in Barcelona. 
РОСС: Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking… 
НЕДРУГ: I love hiking! 
РОСС: Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo… 
НЕДРУГ: I think its Tibidabo. 
РОСС: Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go? 
РОСС: Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it. 
РОСС: No! No, I don’t…don’t want to. 
ДЖОУИ: How long since you’ve seen a girl naked? 
РОСС: I was backpacking across Western Europe. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m not feeling it. 
РОСС: I was just outside Barcelona, hiking… 
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot? 
РОСС: It’s been six months! I’m always hot! 
ДЖОУИ: Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong. 
РОСС: I’ll try that. 
ДЖОУИ: All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right? 
РОСС: Thanks. 
ДЖОУИ: Good luck. 
РОСС: Thanks. And-and hey Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
РОСС: Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out. 
ДЖОУИ: That means a lot to me man. 
РОСС: Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross! 
РОСС: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? 
РОСС: That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was. 
РОСС: So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, definitely. 
РОСС: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me! 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape! 
РОСС: Thank you. No! 
ДЖОУИ: You’re right. 
РОСС: Joey! No! 
ДЖОУИ: Loud and clear! 
МОНИКА: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number. 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either. 
МОНИКА: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you. 
ФИБИ: Regina Philange. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong. 
МОНИКА: I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! 
МОНИКА: Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well maybe it was all of your questions. 
МОНИКА: What about my questions? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler! 
МОНИКА: Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Was that another question? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Is Ross still here? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. 
РОСС: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. What? You don’t want to see this do you? 
МОНИКА: Hell yeah!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am not gonna show you this! 
ФИБИ: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. 
РОСС: Forget it, she’s destroying it. 
ФИБИ: Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!! 
РОСС: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wanna see it. 
РОСС: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see? 
ДЖОУИ: Are we watchin’ the tape or not?! 
РОСС: I don’t want people to see it for your sake. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. 
РОСС: Rachel, please… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, a little preview! 
РОСС: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, here we go. 
РОСС: Hello! Can I get you anything? 
ДЖОУИ: I’m so happy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There I am. 
ФИБИ: You’re gonna get pregnant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I… 
РОСС: You didn’t do it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today. 
МОНИКА: Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kinda hurtin’ my hand though. 
МОНИКА: I know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh… 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you do it on our invitations?! 
РОСС: Not on the ones we sent out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged. 
РОСС: I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it? 
РОСС: I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I wanted to. 
РОСС: So we…we both wanted to. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Interesting. 
РОСС: Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me. 
РОСС: And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, get ready to see some beggin’! 
ФИБИ: Oh, you came on to Ross! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: Now I’m so happy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you talking about?! 
МОНИКА: You used the Europe story! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How do you know about that story?! 
ДЖОУИ: How do you know about that story?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy! 
ДЖОУИ: Some guy!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams. 
ДЖОУИ: Ken Adams!! 
РОСС: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? 
РОСС: Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was an amazing night. 
РОСС: It was. It was an amazing night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You think it looked amazing? 
РОСС: I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, me neither. Yet… 
РОСС: Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it would be really weird. 
РОСС: Good luck. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good luck to you. 
РОСС: Mind if I mute? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please. 
РОСС: Oh, oh there go the clothes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are undressing very quickly. 
РОСС: Six months Rachel, six months. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah. Oh. 
РОСС: Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s what I was gonna say. 
РОСС: Oh nice tan! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend. 
РОСС: Ah…. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Have you been working out? 
РОСС: I have been working out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Wow, this is so much better than I… 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! Ew! 
РОСС: Oh that’s not pretty. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh! 
РОСС: No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God! 
РОСС: Oh no! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, make it stop! 
РОСС: Oh no!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Make it stop!! 
РОСС: No!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Have to make it stop!! 
РОСС: No!!! 
МОНИКА: Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… That is their old number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jenny! That is so Jenny!
