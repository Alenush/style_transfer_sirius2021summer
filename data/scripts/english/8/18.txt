НЕДРУГ: Mark Kunerth Story by: Peter Tibbals Transcribed by: Cassie With Help From: Eric Aasen.
ФИБИ: Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parents anniversary party?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РОСС: Sure. Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: So, whos the guy?
ФИБИ: Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
ФИБИ: Yeah, hes really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
МОНИКА: Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
РОСС: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
МОНИКА: Yeah, Id really like to.
РОСС: Okay, hopefully this time mom wont boo you.
МОНИКА: Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
МОНИКА: No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, God, your brother. Know what theyll say this year? God, you.
ДЖОУИ: Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
МОНИКА: Really you can do that?
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I cant do it with you guys watching me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing?
МОНИКА: Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its a dog.
МОНИКА: Its a dead dog. Thats ChiChi she died when I was in high school.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk about their dead pet?
МОНИКА: The good stuff, huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: You got a present for my parents. Thats so sweet.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
РОСС: Aww that is so cool.
ДЖОУИ: And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
РОСС: Aww! ChiChi! Oh, I loved this dog! Yknow Monica couldnt get braces because ChiChi needed knee surgery.
МОНИКА: What?!
РОСС: You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no wait! Dont tell me. Let me guess. Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention you. Chandler, Im kidding all ready youre my favorite!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ha!
НЕДРУГ: Why dont all of you tell me a little about your self?
РОСС: Ah, actually, Im sorry we-we probably should get going.
НЕДРУГ: Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I, uh, think you already are.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous thanOh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
МОНИКА: Thats my old dog. He passed away years ago.
НЕДРУГ: Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So wheres the party?
МОНИКА: Its out on the island. Its in Massapequa.
НЕДРУГ: Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? Transcribers Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.
РОСС: Well, there is an Arbys in the shape of a tee-pee.
МОНИКА: Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
МОНИКА: And Ive got the car keys.
НЕДРУГ: Were driving!?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Aces!
РОСС: So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
РОСС: Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, otherwise Im not going.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РОСС: Hi! Hey mom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
НЕДРУГ: Jack?
НЕДРУГ: Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
РОСС: Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmmm.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations you two!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank youwere so excited.
НЕДРУГ: And also, congratulations on your wedding.
РОСС: WhaWhat?
НЕДРУГ: Can we talk to you for just a yknow Its just a little thing. Well we think its absolutely marvelous that youre having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why weve told them all that youre married.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for going along with this.
РОСС: Dad so what we have to pretend that were married?
НЕДРУГ: Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
РОСС: Can you believe that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
РОСС: No, us having to lie about being married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I know I dont either, but ya know what, its their party, and its just one night. And we dont even have to lie we just wont say anything. If it comes up again, well justsmile. Well nod along.
НЕДРУГ: Ross!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel!
РОСС: Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding.
НЕДРУГ: Hmmmm.
НЕДРУГ: Heres a little something to get you started.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: So, hows married life treating you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Unbelievable!
РОСС: We love marriage!
НЕДРУГ: Great!
РОСС: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room CI feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I dont want to forget this moment! Its like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont think the flash went off.
НЕДРУГ: Dahaaa! Im going to find the mens room, be right back.
ФИБИ: Ill go with you.
НЕДРУГ: Come on!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
ДЖОУИ: I have to go to the bathroom too, but I dont want him complimenting my thing.
РОСС: Im so we werent in the car! Did he ever let up?
МОНИКА: He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
РОСС: This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry.
ФИБИ: Were you guys making fun of Parker?
РОСС: That depends, how much did you hear?
ФИБИ: So, he a little enthusiastic, whats wrong with that?
МОНИКА: Its just that, its so much.
ФИБИ: Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people youve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends dont do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the whos who of human crap.
МОНИКА: I feel terrible.
ДЖОУИ: I know.
РОСС: What was wrong with Mona?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Open it! Open it! Open it!
РОСС: Yeah baby!
НЕДРУГ: So we never got to hear about your wedding!
НЕДРУГ: We were surprise that we werent invited.
РОСС: No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
НЕДРУГ: Where did you have it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isnt She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Stevies an old family friend.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So would I. You wouldnt think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
РОСС: Would you excuse us for a second? Umm. what are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Im not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
РОСС: Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
НЕДРУГ: Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
ФИБИ: No, Im fine. Im great. Im with you.
НЕДРУГ: And Im with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to mans plate dispensing problems.
ФИБИ: Hm huh, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
ФИБИ: No, thats not necessary.
НЕДРУГ: Please.
ФИБИ: No, actually I dont eat.
НЕДРУГ: I wont quit until you try.
ФИБИ: Okay, fine! Fine! Mmmhmmmmm.
НЕДРУГ: What are they like? Ive never had one.
ФИБИ: Why dont you just try one?
НЕДРУГ: No, they look too weird.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doin?
МОНИКА: Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be fighting for breath.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
НЕДРУГ: Blind?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
НЕДРУГ: Ill bet you looked beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I dont know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
НЕДРУГ: So, how did you propose?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. Thats a great story.
РОСС: Well, um, actually, II took her to the planetarium. Thats-thats where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.
НЕДРУГ: Oh that is so sweet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
РОСС: Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words Will you marry me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And the ring, was the size of my fist!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parkers a nice guy and Id like to get to know him.
ФИБИ: Then you better do it now.
ДЖОУИ: Why?
ФИБИ: Because Im going to kill him.
ДЖОУИ: What-what?
ФИБИ: You guys were right. Hes just too excited abouteverything. I mean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35th anniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks.
ДЖОУИ: I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
ФИБИ: Are you sure it wasnt an oyster?
ДЖОУИ: I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it. Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.
ФИБИ: Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy.
ФИБИ: You think?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Ya know what I think I think we were all just being too negative.
ФИБИ: Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Im a sunny, positive person.
ДЖОУИ: Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
ФИБИ: Whats that now?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing.
ФИБИ: Oh look its Parker!
НЕДРУГ: Look! Its the bunny hop!
ФИБИ: Oooh I love it!
НЕДРУГ: You do?!
ФИБИ: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
МОНИКА: Okay its time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year Im going to do it.
МОНИКА: No, no its going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably dont say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, ImIm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she cant because shes dead. As is our dog ChiChi. I mean look how cute she is. Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember shes dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didnt see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Heres to mom and dad! Whatever!
НЕДРУГ: Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasnt it interesting, Jack?
НЕДРУГ: Why dont I remember this dog?
НЕДРУГ: Ross, why dont you give us your toast now?
РОСС: Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year.
НЕДРУГ: Youre not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary.
РОСС: No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, II just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, Rachel, and myself. Umm, that ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
НЕДРУГ: Oh Ross.
НЕДРУГ: I just wish Nana were alive to hear Rosss toast.
НЕДРУГ: My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
ФИБИ: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
НЕДРУГ: I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words.
ФИБИ: Oh thank God.
НЕДРУГ: Its a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst.
ФИБИ: Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why dont we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
НЕДРУГ: That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch Ive ever sat on in my entire life.
ФИБИ: Lets try something else, lets play a game.
НЕДРУГ: I love games!
ФИБИ: Shocking! Lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
НЕДРУГ: OrJenga.
ФИБИ: But, lets play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
НЕДРУГ: I lose, now Jenga.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Is something wrong?
ФИБИ: Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnt perfect? Everything isnt magical? Everything isnt a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
НЕДРУГ: Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
ФИБИ: You dont have to put a good spin on everything.
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry thats who I am. Im a positive person.
ФИБИ: No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
НЕДРУГ: So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
ФИБИ: Much less happy!
НЕДРУГ: Fine! Well then to quote Ross, Id better be going.
ФИБИ: So long! Dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
НЕДРУГ: Isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your entire life?
ФИБИ: Uh huh.
РОСС: and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
РОСС: But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was really fun being married to you tonight.
РОСС: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That proposal, at the planetarium.
РОСС: I know, I know it was stupid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up?
РОСС: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too.
РОСС: Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Goodnight.
РОСС: Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I will think about it.
РОСС: Thats all Im askin
МОНИКА: Okay thats it. I give up. At mom and dads 40th anniversary, youre the one giving the speech.
РОСС: Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.
МОНИКА: Oh, come on.
РОСС: Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of ChiChi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
