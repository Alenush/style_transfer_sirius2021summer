МОНИКА: Hey! So what do you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
МОНИКА: Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend on bootsor rent.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im gonna miss being able to afford food.
МОНИКА: Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, Oh, these are way too expensive for you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She had a point.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
МОНИКА: Theyre mine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Return them?! Shh! Theyre gonna hear you!
МОНИКА: Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean II know they cost a lot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have you.
МОНИКА: Nice try Im keeping the boots.
РОСС: Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time.
ФИБИ: How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hes talking to the baby.
ФИБИ: Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, I cant wait to hear your first words, I thought, Theres a trick.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
ФИБИ: Okay.
РОСС: Bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey Rach, listenHi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, shes really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, yknow, to give her some advice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors.
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! Oh my God! Im successful!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, so will you meet with her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Id love to! Have her come by the office.
ДЖОУИ: Great! Thanks! Youre gonna love her so much. AndOh, shes the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, yknow the S. A. Ts?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: She took em!
ФИБИ: Hey Ross! Doesnt Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
РОСС: Yeah. Why?
ФИБИ: Sting has a son that goes there too!
РОСС: Yeah I know hes in Bens class.
ФИБИ: You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
РОСС: Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
ФИБИ: Stings son, seven years old and theres a picture.
РОСС: What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
ФИБИ: No, its New York magazine. Its an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
РОСС: Uh, I actually havent even met him.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, yeah thats too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but its totally sold out. I know! Why dont you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two Ill take you.
РОСС: Well actually, Im picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe hell be there.
ФИБИ: There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! Thats why you have kids!
МОНИКА: Hey guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Monica!
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi boots.
МОНИКА: See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already! Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
ФИБИ: Wow! Theyre beautiful!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh.
МОНИКА: They hurt so much!
ФИБИ: What?!
МОНИКА: The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well-well you can give them to me! I havent felt my feet in years!
МОНИКА: I cant! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that Id wear them all the time, I just cant give them away!
ФИБИ: Well then get your money back and return them!
МОНИКА: I cant do that either! The soles are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont think you did a very thorough job!
РОСС: I dropped him off at Carols. Anyway, it turns out that Im not going to be able to get those tickets though.
ФИБИ: Oh no! Why not?
РОСС: Well it turns out that Ben and Stings son do not get along.
ФИБИ: How come?!
РОСС: Apparently, Stings son made fun of the fact that Bens moms are lesbinims.
ФИБИ: Wait! But Ross if they dont get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
РОСС: Phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends.
ФИБИ: Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
РОСС: Playpen?! Bens seven!
ФИБИ: Your kid is seven?! Hes really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
РОСС: Look Im sorry Pheebs, I cant do it.
ФИБИ: Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: Rosssss can!
РОСС: Look Phoebe, Im sorry its just.
ФИБИ: Rossss can!
РОСС: Phoebe, I.
ФИБИ: Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!
ДЖОУИ: Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Joey, Im hardly a.
ДЖОУИ: My little sister Dina!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right! Hi Dina!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nice to meet you.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks so much for meetin with me. Joeys told me so much about you!
ДЖОУИ: This is so exciting for her. Well, Ill let you two fashists get down to business.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. All right Dina, well lets talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Lets see, theres design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, theres-theres sales, which is great because you get to travel.
НЕДРУГ: II dont care about fashion! Im pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And theres marketing.
МОНИКА: Ahhhhh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whats wrong?
МОНИКА: Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
МОНИКА: Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
МОНИКА: II dontI dont think that Im gonna wear the boots tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not?
МОНИКА: Well yknow, Im justIm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
МОНИКА: Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
МОНИКА: Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
НЕДРУГ: II cant go in there. I cant tell him!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, its going to be okay. Hes been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset thats what the meatball sub is for.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Its my fashion girls! Whats wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, why dont you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich?
НЕДРУГ: Joe, mom and dad are fine.
ДЖОУИ: Is that a sandwich?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joeytheres something that youshould know. Dina?
НЕДРУГ: Im pregnant.
ДЖОУИ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
ДЖОУИ: Well obviously this is a mistake! You cant be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
НЕДРУГ: Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Dina.
ДЖОУИ: Bub! I cant believe this! Youre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
НЕДРУГ: Bobby Corso, but hes a real nice guy. I like him a lot. Hes real funny.
ДЖОУИ: You got pregnant for funny?! Dinaif hes funnylaugh! All right, Ill be back in a little while! You stay here!
НЕДРУГ: Why? Where are you going?
ДЖОУИ: I cant look at you right now!
НЕДРУГ: Wow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
ФИБИ: Oh, there you are Ben!
НЕДРУГ: Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
ФИБИ: Well, I heard youre having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boys name is Stings son.
НЕДРУГ: Jack? I hate him! Hes a jerk.
ФИБИ: Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
НЕДРУГ: I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
ФИБИ: Him youre friends with.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
ФИБИ: Yes! Yes you can, Im looking for Jacks parents.
НЕДРУГ: Are you with one of the students?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, Im with Ben.
НЕДРУГ: Are you one of Bens mothers?
ФИБИ: I am one of Bens mothers. Im a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
НЕДРУГ: Well hi, Im Jenny Boone. Im the new teacher here.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Ive only met your partner Carol.
ФИБИ: Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
НЕДРУГ: Right. Are you looking for Jacks parents to discuss the problems hes having with Ben? Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
ФИБИ: Yeah! Lets do that! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow, that party wasnt bad.
МОНИКА: Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
МОНИКА: Oh no, we cant walk!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets go.
МОНИКА: Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whats going on?
МОНИКА: I cant walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. Its oddly unsettling.
МОНИКА: How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hop on.
МОНИКА: Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. AhOohOohhOhhOh GodOhhOhOhhOhhhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on.
НЕДРУГ: Do you ever worry that youll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What college was that Dina?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Bobby!
НЕДРУГ: Hi Dina. Good to see you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, what are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Joey this is crazy!
ДЖОУИ: Dont interrupt me when Im talkin to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man.
НЕДРУГ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Oh youll take em!
НЕДРУГ: No I wont!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! You dont get a say in this!
НЕДРУГ: Yes I do!
ДЖОУИ: Ahhh! I heard I do, were halfway there! Okay! You!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, its not legal. Okay? They-they dont have a marriage license, they dont have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
ДЖОУИ: Well what am I supposed to do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Youre supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
ДЖОУИ: No they cant! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
НЕДРУГ: Yeahwe kinda didnt use any.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
ФИБИ: Wow! This place is incredible! Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Im Trudie.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: You must be Bens mum.
ФИБИ: Why else would I be here?
НЕДРУГ: Do sit down.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: I gather Jack and Ben havent been getting along lately.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Im told there are two sides to this story, but all Ive heard is that Bens a bit of a poo-poo head.
ФИБИ: Umm, Im sorry. Wont-wont Jacks father be joining us?
НЕДРУГ: Oh Im sorry, Jacks father is not available.
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 oclock?
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, I know that wouldnt work. My husbands in concert.
ФИБИ: Concert. Yeah. That does put us inquite a pickle. Because you see Im very busy before and after the concert, and hes obviously busy during.
НЕДРУГ: So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
ФИБИ: Unless! Unless umm, okay II would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
НЕДРУГ: Are you here for tickets?
ФИБИ: Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
НЕДРУГ: Im not giving concert tickets to someone whod use their son like this!
ФИБИ: Oh good! Then youre in luck! Bens not my son!
НЕДРУГ: Look, Ive just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
ФИБИ: The Police? Here? A reunion?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
МОНИКА: Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
МОНИКА: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
МОНИКА: Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont have your boots.
МОНИКА: Well I dont have them either. Where are they?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
МОНИКА: Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
МОНИКА: Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get a chance to say goodbye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
МОНИКА: Okay. All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Bye bootsWait! Half off?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, just because theyre not getting married doesnt mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
ДЖОУИ: Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Lets hear their plan! Now, whats the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
НЕДРУГ: WellI really have high hopes for my band.
ДЖОУИ: You were right. He is funny.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why dont you tell us a little bit about your band?
НЕДРУГ: Well its just me and my pal Rooster, the bands name is Numb Nuts.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, thats not a compliment!
НЕДРУГ: No Joey! I knew you wouldnt be supportive!
ДЖОУИ: So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? Youre gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! You cant be a single mother alone! Youre gonna ruin your life!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No! Its different for you. Youre so strong and together. Youre not some dumb kid who doesnt know what shes doing.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
ДЖОУИ: One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe! Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
НЕДРУГ: Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help. And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
НЕДРУГ: You bet I am! And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
НЕДРУГ: Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
ДЖОУИ: Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
НЕДРУГ: And youre my big brother! I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world. Im not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
ДЖОУИ: Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
ДЖОУИ: Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
НЕДРУГ: Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
ДЖОУИ: Thats right! By his uncle too!
НЕДРУГ: And by you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
ДЖОУИ: Come here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
РОСС: Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
РОСС: Welllets just say Rosss caaaaan!
ФИБИ: Oo, where are the seats?
РОСС: Uh, middle balcony.
ФИБИ: Okay, now would you say that thats more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
РОСС: Yeah.
