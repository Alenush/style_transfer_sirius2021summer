НЕДРУГ: Sherry BilsingGraham amp Ellen Plummer Transcribed by: Eric Aasen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So whats the final head count on my baby shower?
ФИБИ: About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
МОНИКА: Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! You mean theyre not coming to a social event where theres no men and theres no booze?! Thats shocking! I dont care, as long as my moms here.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, your mother!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! My moms not gonna be here?!
МОНИКА: Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My God!
МОНИКА: Well it wasnt my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
ФИБИ: Well I dont, I dont have a mother so often I forget that other people.
МОНИКА: Oh give it a rest!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
ФИБИ: No. Neither is mine.
МОНИКА: Okay, yknow what? Dont worry, okay? Well take care of it. Well call her. Just go home and get ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please, make sure she comes. Its really important to me, I mean its my mom!
ФИБИ: I know. I know, whats her number?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont know.
МОНИКА: Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If youre in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call herHello Mrs. Green! Hi, its Monica Geller.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hello Monica.
МОНИКА: Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but weve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
НЕДРУГ: I know, my daughters told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
МОНИКА: Yeah, Im sorry. ImIm so sorry.
НЕДРУГ: For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
МОНИКА: Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? Its today at four.
НЕДРУГ: Well all right. Ill see you at four.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ФИБИ: Isnt it at three?
МОНИКА: Son of a bitch!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, I cant go. Im practicing I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
РОСС: Oh cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats great.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day Ill Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night Ill be Joey Trrrribbiani!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name!
ДЖОУИ: But the auditions in a couple hours and I dont even understand the game.
РОСС: Well do you want some help?
ДЖОУИ: Oh really? Thatd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
РОСС: Awesome!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
ДЖОУИ: All right! Lets play Bamboozled!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bamboozled?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, isnt that a cool name?
РОСС: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
ДЖОУИ: All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why dont you tell us a little something about you Ross?
РОСС: Well uh, IIm a paleontologist. Umm, II live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh.
ДЖОУИ: I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
ДЖОУИ: Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bogota.
ДЖОУИ: Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does a Wicked Wango card do?
ДЖОУИ: I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Higher or lower than what?
ДЖОУИ: This is embarrassing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you believe how lame this is?
РОСС: Im sorry, I dont believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
ФИБИ: Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?
МОНИКА: You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
ФИБИ: What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
МОНИКА: Hi!
ФИБИ: Im so glad you could make it.
МОНИКА: Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
НЕДРУГ: Try. Theres my little girl.
МОНИКА: Shes still mad.
ФИБИ: Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
ФИБИ: No look, weve apologized twice! I cant do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
МОНИКА: Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
НЕДРУГ: Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didnt know better Id say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, lets get some tea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I dont want you to use your housekeeper cause it would just split her focus.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I dont even have a housekeeper.
НЕДРУГ: Its like youre a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You dont know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
НЕДРУГ: Such a sweet woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, however great she was I just cant afford that.
НЕДРУГ: Oh Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: I just had the greatest idea! Im gonna come live with you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh-wh-what? What?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Im so happy Im gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Yes I do.
ДЖОУИ: All right Ross youre in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
РОСС: The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, Ill take another question.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
РОСС: Its okay, Im ready.
ДЖОУИ: No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, TrisHoly cow, thats a big word. Trisc Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me see that.
ДЖОУИ: This one right here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Triscadecaphobia.
РОСС: The fear of Triscuts!
ДЖОУИ: No! No, fear of the number 13.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fear of Triscuts?
РОСС: Its possible, they have really sharp edges.
ДЖОУИ: All right Chandler, youre up.
РОСС: Wait a minute, II believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This game makes no sense!
РОСС: Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
ДЖОУИ: All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
ДЖОУИ: You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Either, it makes no difference.
ДЖОУИ: Choose, you jackass!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ill take a card.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!
РОСС: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This game is kinda fun.
РОСС: You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why did you invite my mother?!
МОНИКА: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
ФИБИ: For how long?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
МОНИКА: I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
ФИБИ: She cant hear you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
ФИБИ: Well, if you dont want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Youre right. Youre right. I mean Im about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! Shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
МОНИКА: Thats right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you dont want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: This is great! Now shes gonna be mad at Rachel! Yknow what? And Im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
ФИБИ: I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! Its time to open the presents!
МОНИКА: Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because youre the most important person in this room. And in the world!
НЕДРУГ: Well uh, I dont have a gift because I wasnt invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyones attention.
ФИБИ: How about you less important people, lets open your presents!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
НЕДРУГ: Sweetheart I know youre gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But mom, I really know what Im doing. I can handle this.
НЕДРУГ: Really? Remember Twinkles?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
ФИБИ: Okay, come on Rach its present time! Yknow youre the glue thats holding this whole party together. Its kinda falling apart here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh look.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow!
ФИБИ: Okay, this is from your friend at work.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That cant be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
НЕДРУГ: Darling, thats a breast pump!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! Whats this?
НЕДРУГ: Its a diaper genie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
НЕДРУГ: No! Its where you put the dirty ones!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well thats gross, why dont you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
НЕДРУГ: Oh youre gonna do that ten times a day?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
НЕДРУГ: No dear, thats what babies do.
МОНИКА: Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
НЕДРУГ: Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while youre trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dont know, Id leave it on the changing table? What?! Whatd I do? Whatd I do?!
НЕДРУГ: You cant leave a baby alone!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh comeOf course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Yknow what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, Im just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
НЕДРУГ: Its actually a bassinet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay mommy, dont ever leave me.
ДЖОУИ: In what John Houston film would you hear this line, Badges? We dont need no stinkin badges!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
ДЖОУИ: Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
ДЖОУИ: Yes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Id like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
ДЖОУИ: Wise choice, how many rungs?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Six!
ДЖОУИ: That noise can only me one thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hungry monkey.
РОСС: Hungry monkey! Haaa! Id like a Wicked Wango card!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, its an audio question, name this television theme song.
РОСС: Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell it to the Time Turtle!
РОСС: Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Yes, youre back in the lead!
РОСС: Id like to spin the wheel!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on!
ДЖОУИ: All right! All right! Uh, umm, SuperSpeedy Speed round!
РОСС: Is there a hopping bonus?
ДЖОУИ: Of course!
ДЖОУИ: Who invented bifocals?
РОСС: Ben Franklin.
ДЖОУИ: Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
РОСС: Queen Victoria.
ДЖОУИ: Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
РОСС: Noooo! Every time!
ДЖОУИ: Now, over to Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Id like a Google Card.
ДЖОУИ: Are you sure?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! No! Google!
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been Bamboozled!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nooo!
РОСС: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is the best game ever!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
НЕДРУГ: Of course I am!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot. Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but II just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The babys coming and I dont know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
НЕДРУГ: No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
НЕДРУГ: Im going to the bathroom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
МОНИКА: It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
РОСС: I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
ФИБИ: Not if you were here.
РОСС: Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
РОСС: A PlayDough Barber Shop?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.
РОСС: Uh, what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
РОСС: WhatYoure not serious. I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. Shell drive us totally crazy.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Ross!
РОСС: Hi roomie!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, hi! Im Ray Im the producer of the show.
ДЖОУИ: Its a pleasure to meet you Ray.
НЕДРУГ: And this is Duncan and Erin, theyre gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, lets get the camera rolling.
ДЖОУИ: RightieO Ray!
НЕДРУГ: Whenever youre ready.
ДЖОУИ: Hello, Im Joey Tribbiani! Lets play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
НЕДРУГ: Wayne Gretzky.
ДЖОУИ: Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
НЕДРУГ: Uh Joey, didnt your agents give you the revised rules? Weve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
ДЖОУИ: WhatWhy?!
НЕДРУГ: Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didnt follow it.
ДЖОУИ: Well whats complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey you yank his tail and boom! Youre in Paradise Pond!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah all thats gone. Its basically just a simple question and answer game now.
ДЖОУИ: Well whats fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game thats just people standing around answering questions?
НЕДРУГ: Well, therell be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
ДЖОУИ: Lets play Bamboozled!
НЕДРУГ: and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
РОСС: Well wewe dont have a garage.
НЕДРУГ: Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
РОСС: Yknow what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, its not absolutely vital that you live with us.
НЕДРУГ: Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do. I really do. I dont know anything.
РОСС: ImIm sure thats not true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
ФИБИ: No, not a thing.
МОНИКА: Its frightening.
РОСС: Well uh, yknow what? Even if she doesnt know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didnt live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
НЕДРУГ: Thats true. You do have another child.
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
РОСС: Thats a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there toto feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
НЕДРУГ: Well then you really dont need me to live with you.
РОСС: Yes! Yes, youre gonna be so missed.
НЕДРУГ: Youre gonna be a great father.
РОСС: Well youre gonna be a wonderful grandma.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello?! I still dont know what the hell Im doing!
РОСС: Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. Youllyoure gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. Do you remember?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I hope youre going somewhere with this.
РОСС: Look at you! WhatYoure-youre this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. II have no doubt youre gonna be an incredible mother.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
РОСС: Im telling you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: All right you two, Im gonna get going.
РОСС: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. Ill let myself out. Its like Im not here, which I almost wasnt.
МОНИКА: Youre still so funny. Youre so funny. What do I do?
ФИБИ: Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and shes been nothing but terrible to you. And dont forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you for it.
МОНИКА: Yknow what? Youre-youre right.
ФИБИ: Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, Id tell her off.
МОНИКА: Really?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh!
МОНИКА: Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasnt on purpose! But what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful!
НЕДРУГ: Spiteful?!
МОНИКА: Thats right! Maybe its time you took a good hard look at a mirror young ladyold ladylady!
ФИБИ: Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.
МОНИКА: So whenever youre ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I cant feel my legs!
ФИБИ: You were fantastic! Im so proud of you!
МОНИКА: Yeah? Im proud of me too.
ФИБИ: You should be!
МОНИКА: Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
ФИБИ: You got it!
МОНИКА: Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay Im really sorry! Im apologizing for the Okay, I bit my tongue, but Im still really sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Im ready.
РОСС: You sure?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, Ive done my studying and I really know my stuff.
РОСС: All right then. Rachel Green! Lets play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the babys bath water?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, put your elbow in it.
РОСС: Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
РОСС: Thats correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Check if its wet, check if its hungry, burp it!
РОСС: Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A card! A card! I pick a card!
