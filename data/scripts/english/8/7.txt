МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow uh, I didnt actually do this.
МОНИКА: Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it wasnt you.
МОНИКА: Well then who?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got a maid. Yay!
МОНИКА: I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control
МОНИКА: Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
МОНИКА: Did she really say that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
МОНИКА: Fine, I can do it. Whew.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whats the matter?
МОНИКА: Well, usually when Im this anxious, I clean!
ФИБИ: Whos cell phone is that? Its just so annoying; everywhere you go.
РОСС: I think its coming from your bag.
ФИБИ: I never get calls!! Hello?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, its Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursulas fiancée.
ФИБИ: Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, howd you get this number?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I have a friend whos a cop and he got it for me.
ФИБИ: Wow! What an incredible violationand wonderful surprise.
НЕДРУГ: Uh listen, I justI thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
ФИБИ: Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! What did he do?
ФИБИ: Shhh! Im talking.
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person whoeats lunch.
ФИБИ: Are you asking me out? Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah uhokay. Im-Im sorry. Bye.
ФИБИ: No! Wait! I was just saying that so youd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, I wont take no for an answer.
ФИБИ: Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
НЕДРУГ: Great! But wh-whHow do you know where I live?
ФИБИ: Ive got friends too. Okay, bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Im going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I cant make lunch.
РОСС: So apparently Im available for lunch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cant. Im busy. Im apartment hunting.
РОСС: Youre moving?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I cant live with Joey once the baby comes. I dont want my childs first words to be, "How you doin?"
РОСС: So does-does Joey know youre moving?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I havent discussed it with him yet, but I know hes gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
РОСС: Thats not really porn.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not so much.
РОСС: Hey, yknow what and if youre looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
РОСС: Well I dont know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah that would really be great.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldnt. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
РОСС: Yeah. No. No youre right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shall we?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Yes?
РОСС: Hi. Im Ross Geller. I live in the building.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And Im Rachel, an admirer of the building.
РОСС: I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and Im so sorry for your loss.
НЕДРУГ: She didnt pass.
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: My mothers still alive.
РОСС: Oh, thank God!
НЕДРУГ: It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but shes a tough old bird.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh.
НЕДРУГ: Are you close with her?
РОСС: Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room.
НЕДРУГ: You speak Dutch? Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten.
РОСС: Yknow I would its just painful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So shes really not dead.
НЕДРУГ: No, shes hanging in there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm. Do you thinkCould you tell me if shes hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
НЕДРУГ: Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Whered you get it?
МОНИКА: Oh well umm, I make it myself! Its two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient isyknow what? We just met.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Uhh, Im gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back Ill clean behind the refrigerator.
МОНИКА: I love her.
НЕДРУГ: Ill be back in a minute.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See? I told you.
МОНИКА: She stole my jeans!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
МОНИКА: Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She mustve been planning this for years!
МОНИКА: I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
МОНИКА: I guess.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?
МОНИКА: Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
МОНИКА: Yeah!
ФИБИ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Come in, Im so glad youre here.
ФИБИ: Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I justI got so angry just looking at herface.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry. I justwhen I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
ФИБИ: Maybe this is too weird.
НЕДРУГ: No wait! Theres only a problem when I look at you. Oh I got it! I got it.
ФИБИ: No dont tear out your eyes!!
НЕДРУГ: I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
НЕДРУГ: Not really. Youyoure blurry, but you still look like Ursula. Youre Blursula. Okay wait. MaybeIf I-if I just dont look at you for a while. See? Itit works. Im not, Im not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
ФИБИ: Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldnt be this hard. Yknow? This is our first date yknow? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand? and yknow first kisses andsecond kisses.
РОСС: Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
НЕДРУГ: Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?
РОСС: Yeah, were done.
НЕДРУГ: Ezel.
РОСС: Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
РОСС: Really?!
ДЖОУИ: No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
РОСС: Sweet!
ДЖОУИ: All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
РОСС: Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
ДЖОУИ: To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre not gonna be on TV!
РОСС: No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, youre switching apartments?
РОСС: Its not for me, its for Rachel.
ДЖОУИ: But Rachel has an apartment.
РОСС: Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.
ДЖОУИ: She is?
РОСС: Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?
ДЖОУИ: I guess I didnt really think about it.
РОСС: Ezel! Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!
НЕДРУГ: Jij hebt seks met ezels.
РОСС: Damnit!
МОНИКА: Nice jeans!
НЕДРУГ: Oh thanks! I like your top.
МОНИКА: Oh. Youre not gettin it.
НЕДРУГ: What happened?!
МОНИКА: Oh, I fell asleep.
НЕДРУГ: I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
МОНИКА: Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? Thatll really work up your appetite for lunch.
НЕДРУГ: All right.
МОНИКА: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Whats going on?!
МОНИКА: Im sorry. Ive never had a maid before, is this not okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How was the game?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, okay. II ate way too much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh. So umm, I was talkin to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
ДЖОУИ: I was kinda hoping youd stay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh but Joey, I have to go. Theres no room for a baby here.
ДЖОУИ: No room? Its a baby. Its like this big. Yknow, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, its cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldnt even notice it. Wheres the baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, its not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when theres a screaming baby around.
ДЖОУИ: I could use a challenge! Its getting pretty easy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, its so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I cant do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
ДЖОУИ: I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnt have to change.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
ДЖОУИ: Yknow I blame Ross for this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do too a little bit.
ДЖОУИ: Im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate I ever had.
ФИБИ: Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.
ФИБИ: No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later.
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely. I love the way you kiss.
ФИБИ: Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How come?
МОНИКА: Because I put my head between her legs.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To see her pants?
МОНИКА: Theyre my pants!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
МОНИКА: No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
МОНИКА: Fine. Shes wearing my bra!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh dear God!
МОНИКА: My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.
МОНИКА: Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Heres another planNo!
МОНИКА: I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
МОНИКА: Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a team! Were in this together!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I fear a jury will see it the same way!
МОНИКА: Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts all the time!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You see that?
МОНИКА: Do you see this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
МОНИКА: Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You need new clothes.
РОСС: Hi. How is she?
НЕДРУГ: Its not looking good.
РОСС: Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
НЕДРУГ: Thats so sweet. Would you like to come in and say good-bye? Im sure it would mean a lot to her.
РОСС: Oh I dont know that it would.
НЕДРУГ: Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
РОСС: All right then.
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Welcome back!
ФИБИ: Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
НЕДРУГ: I dont know, Im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
ФИБИ: Why?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, the sex.
ФИБИ: What sex?
НЕДРУГ: Our sex.
ФИБИ: We didnt have sex.
НЕДРУГ: Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
ФИБИ: Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
НЕДРУГ: Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
ФИБИ: You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
НЕДРУГ: Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
ФИБИ: You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
НЕДРУГ: Well I was just so excited to see you.
ФИБИ: Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
НЕДРУГ: No-no its not! I dont want to lose you! Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
ФИБИ: So I guess this is it.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
ФИБИ: Yeah, so do you.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im leaning. This is where I lean.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Brenda a bee!
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
НЕДРУГ: I think I know whats going on here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do?
НЕДРУГ: Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Where did you get those jeans?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You gave them to me!
МОНИКА: No I didnt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
МОНИКА: Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What bra?
МОНИКА: The pink one with the flowers?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You mean the one that youre wearing?
НЕДРУГ: I quit!
МОНИКА: Sounds about right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is this?
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uhOh look! Heres a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Youre so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
ДЖОУИ: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. That-that-thats really just to show where the baby would go. Yknow why dont I hold on to him so that theres no confusion?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Joey the baby is going to be crying, its going to be loud.
ДЖОУИ: Im loud!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its gonna be up all night!
ДЖОУИ: Im up all night!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its gonna poop!
ДЖОУИ: Hello!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What about all the women you want to bring home?
ДЖОУИ: Look, if Im bringing home a woman who cant stand being around a baby, then maybe I dont want to be with that woman! Or maybe well just do it in the bathroom of the club!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, are you sure?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! All rightLook, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But, itll also be reallyreally great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I want me to stay too.
ДЖОУИ: Ohh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
ДЖОУИ: I know! I found it on the street.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
ДЖОУИ: I dont know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its moving.
ДЖОУИ: Ew.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
ДЖОУИ: Ooh! Ah! Okay!
РОСС: Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I dont care, because you got the apartment. Yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
ДЖОУИ: Isnt that great?
