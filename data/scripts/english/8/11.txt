РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look at that guy by the window, wow!
ФИБИ: Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
ФИБИ: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! So this has happened to you?
ФИБИ: Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a <i>Foot Locker</i>.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yknow what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, Ill ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Yeah, thats what you need a goodpill.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Hey!
РОСС: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
РОСС: Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
РОСС: Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, probably at the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
ДЖОУИ: Im missin picture time?!
ФИБИ: Yknow she has a face Ross!
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.
РОСС: Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
НЕДРУГ: Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
РОСС: Together? Like-like to people?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?
РОСС: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
РОСС: Uh sure, sure.
НЕДРУГ: Bye guys.
ФИБИ: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Congratulations! You just got married!
РОСС: I know. Can you believe that?
ФИБИ: Wait, Im-Im sorry. Whats the big deal about a holiday card?
РОСС: Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey, hey thats your wife youre talking about!
НЕДРУГ: Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
МОНИКА: Yes, hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
МОНИКА: No leg-chewing for us sir.
НЕДРУГ: Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
МОНИКА: I cant think of anything were doing. Why cant I think of anything were doing?
НЕДРУГ: Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
МОНИКА: Okay, Ill see you tomorrow! Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
МОНИКА: Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it?
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
РОСС: Huh. Wow, this is great.
НЕДРУГ: Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
РОСС: Well, we-we havent said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
НЕДРУГ: How many did you want? Im getting a hundred.
РОСС: A hundred?! Well, I-I guess Ill take aMona, uhI-Im not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
НЕДРУГ: Really? Why not?
РОСС: Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just dont know if were really quite there yet.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yknow, I didnt think of it that way. Youre right. Youre right. So, can I ask you a question?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Where are we?
РОСС: Huh.
НЕДРУГ: Yknow, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
РОСС: Hmm
НЕДРУГ: I mean I love spending time with you, yknow I justI hope were moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Dont you think?
РОСС: Lets do the card!
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: The card! I think were there!
НЕДРУГ: Okay. IBut I think we should still have this conversation.
РОСС: Really?! I mean, even with the card?
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Just so you know, Dr. Long cant be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Yknow who Im talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel? Im Dr. Schiff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you are.
НЕДРУГ: So, hows it going?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
НЕДРУГ: Im a doctor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I dont have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
НЕДРУГ: So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Im very comfortable.
НЕДРУГ: Any painful gas?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
НЕДРУГ: Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry, is there something going on here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you feel it too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ФИБИ: Oh hey! So, how did your doctors appointment go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, lets see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
ФИБИ: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: Why did you do that?
ФИБИ: Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
ФИБИ: You wish.
МОНИКА: Hey, I couldve had you if I wanted you.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah? Come and get it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, even this is turning me on!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey hows it, hows it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
РОСС: Oh yeah, yeah were moving forward. Youll be getting our card!
МОНИКА: You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
РОСС: Yeah, were not just doing a card! Yknow, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
ФИБИ: Ugh! Women!
РОСС: I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh Ross? You asked me that.
РОСС: Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? Im not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. Im horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Yknow, something that says were moving forward without having to talk about it.
МОНИКА: Like asking her to move in with you?
РОСС: Smaller than that.
МОНИКА: Making her a mixed tape?
РОСС: Uh, bigger than that.
ФИБИ: Give her a key to your apartment.
РОСС: Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
МОНИКА: All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
РОСС: Yeah I-I dont-I dont think Im quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
ФИБИ: No, we hate that.
МОНИКА: That is a slap in the face.
РОСС: Forget it. I-IYknow what? Ill just have the conversation. Ill just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
НЕДРУГ: Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.
НЕДРУГ: Oh? Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
НЕДРУГ: Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well now-now youre just talking crazy.
НЕДРУГ: So why cant the three of us go out together?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
НЕДРУГ: Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
НЕДРУГ: Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
РОСС: Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
РОСС: Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you. And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun. Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! Thats-thats the real question. And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun. Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger. No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou are getting younger. I meanyou-you look like youre getting younger by the secondWhats your secret?
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
РОСС: Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.
НЕДРУГ: Okay
РОСС: But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment.
НЕДРУГ: Really?!
РОСС: Really.
НЕДРУГ: You dont think this is too fast.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You gave her a key to your apartment?!
РОСС: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
ФИБИ: Hey. Ooh Ross! Howd the conversation go?
РОСС: Oh great, I live on the street.
ФИБИ: Where?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
НЕДРУГ: Hey everybody.
МОНИКА: Hi Roger.
ФИБИ: So umm, Im gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Umm, hes here to have sex with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: Youre welcome.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe no!
ФИБИ: Its okay, hes a virgin.
МОНИКА: Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think hell have sex with you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
ФИБИ: Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
НЕДРУГ: Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.
НЕДРУГ: BingWhats this?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a <i>Jack</i> and <i>Coke</i> holder.
НЕДРУГ: No, its a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. Were gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no!
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, yknow I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
РОСС: Okay, and oh Im gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Ross, whats going on? You changing the lock?
РОСС: No. That guy is.
НЕДРУГ: I dont understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
НЕДРУГ: Good luck buddy.
НЕДРУГ: Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now youre-youre sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
РОСС: Im trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: I love you!
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! And I love spending time with you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi honey Im home.
МОНИКА: From the tequila factory?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
МОНИКА: Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like <i>Its a Wonderful Life</i> with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
МОНИКА: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, I dont know if were there yet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Hi, Id like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very <i>Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch</i>. Ill call you back.
ДЖОУИ: Who was that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its just the pizza place.
ДЖОУИ: You hung up on the pizza place? I dont hang up on your friends.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry honey, Im just having a, having a rough day.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, whats wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh you really, you really just dont want to hear about it.
ДЖОУИ: Then why did I ask?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, its justand this is really embarrassingbut lately with this whole pregnancy thing Im just finding myselfhow do I put this umm, erotically charged.
ДЖОУИ: Is that college talk for horny?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. So yknow, I have all of these feelings and I dont know what to do about them, because I cant date like a normal person, which is fine because I dont need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, yknow? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what hes doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really sohardto find. So how was your day?
ДЖОУИ: Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I gotta get up early and its almost seven oclock.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, good night!
ДЖОУИ: Good night.
ДЖОУИ: I cant do it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didnt ask you to do it!
ДЖОУИ: Youre Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Youre Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Youre my friend!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right back at ya!
ДЖОУИ: But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And so bad. I dont even know what youre talking about because I didnt ask you to do anything!
ДЖОУИ: I know!
ДЖОУИ: Do you wanna do it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No!
ДЖОУИ: All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats the end of this conversation!
ДЖОУИ: This conversation never happened!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Never happened! Good night!
ДЖОУИ: Good night!
ДЖОУИ: Get back in there!
