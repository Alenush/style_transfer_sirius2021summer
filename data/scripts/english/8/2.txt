РЕЙЧЕЛ: Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night? 
ДЖОУИ: No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite. 
МОНИКА: That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I’m the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to! 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, right. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We got the honeymoon. 
МОНИКА: That’s not ‘til Thursday. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The wedding pictures? 
МОНИКА: They won’t be ready for weeks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not the disposable cameras from the tables. 
МОНИКА: That’s true! I knew I married you for a reason! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? What did you take a picture of? 
ДЖОУИ: Nothing! It was something. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. 
МОНИКА: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You’re 32! 
НЕДРУГ: Here’s a copy of your bill. 
МОНИКА: Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut? 
РОСС: Hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff? 
РОСС: Why not? It’s built into the price of the room. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah but you don’t need——What is this? 
РОСС: Thread! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Score! Where are the disposable cameras? 
РОСС: What disposable cameras? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? 
РОСС: No you didn’t. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said… 
РОСС: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you don’t have the cameras?! 
РОСС: No. Sorry man. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak! 
РОСС: Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great. 
РОСС: In-in three minutes. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler? 
МОНИКА: No! But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is? 
ФИБИ: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman. 
МОНИКА: A tiny salt shaker!!! 
ФИБИ: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt! 
МОНИКА: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun. 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah. 
МОНИКА: Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think? 
ФИБИ: Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. 
МОНИКА: Or this one! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
МОНИКА: Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they? 
МОНИКА: No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant. 
ФИБИ: Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ew! No! 
ФИБИ: What?! I think he’s cute. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then you have his baby. 
ФИБИ: Believe me I’m trying. 
МОНИКА: Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news. 
ФИБИ: Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam! 
МОНИКА: What was that bam? 
ФИБИ: I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant? 
ДЖОУИ: Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah. That’s me. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby? 
ФИБИ: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father? 
ФИБИ: You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. 
ДЖОУИ: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass! 
ФИБИ: David Lynn. 
ДЖОУИ: David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! 
МОНИКА: Who’s David Lynn? 
ФИБИ: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying. 
РОСС: Chandler? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Did you find the cameras? 
РОСС: No. Did you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating. 
РОСС: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed. 
РОСС: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up! 
РОСС: I’m sorry man. Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? 
РОСС: No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious? 
РОСС: I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marriage advice? Really?! 
РОСС: I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers. 
РОСС: What about the chairs? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She picked those out too. 
РОСС: How about the place settings? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was her. 
РОСС: What did you do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop? 
РОСС: Hmm. 
ФИБИ: Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not yet. 
ФИБИ: Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther. 
ФИБИ: Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now! 
ФИБИ: Why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam! 
ФИБИ: Bus? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is! 
ФИБИ: Well-well but it is huge. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father. 
ФИБИ: You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of…See? 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents? 
МОНИКА: No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Give me one more. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say. 
ФИБИ: All right. 
ДЖОУИ: Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Joey! 
ФИБИ: Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! 
МОНИКА: You can’t marry him! 
ФИБИ: Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! 
ДЖОУИ: Why?! Why can’t she marry me?! 
ФИБИ: I can and I will! 
МОНИКА: She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months! 
ФИБИ: It’s Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? Who’s the father? 
ФИБИ: We don’t know. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh… I wonder if that dude. 
МОНИКА: There’s a dude? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Who? Who is it? 
ДЖОУИ: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… 
ФИБИ: Was that story over? 
ДЖОУИ: The guy left this. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I know who the father is… 
МОНИКА: People have got to finish their stories! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Of course. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, would you take one of us? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh… Yeah sure. Click! 
НЕДРУГ: It didn’t click. 
РОСС: I heard it. I heard it. 
НЕДРУГ: But there was no flash. 
НЕДРУГ: Why won’t you take our picture? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, your finger was covering the lens. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here! 
ФИБИ: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? 
ФИБИ: I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, let’s rip! 
ФИБИ: Really? Are you sure? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Okay, sorry. Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rach. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech. 
РОСС: Okay. Okay! 
РОСС: Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s my car! 
РОСС: A ’95 LeSabre?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! 
РОСС: A green LeSabre? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! 
РОСС: I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Green-blue! 
РОСС: Well go! Go move it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you ready for the last picture? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding. 
НЕДРУГ: So, what’s this about? 
ФИБИ: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. 
НЕДРУГ: No. This is my red sweater. 
ФИБИ: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: What’s going on Rach? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s just not the right time. 
НЕДРУГ: It is the right time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m ready for more. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tag… 
НЕДРУГ: Come on Rach, let’s give it another try. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m having a baby. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You can go. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
МОНИКА: I don’t know how any of these got opened?! 
ДЖОУИ: You opened them all? 
МОНИКА: I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! 
МОНИКА: Yeah. What is that? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami. 
МОНИКА: Hey! How’d it go? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. What-what did Tag say? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now? 
ДЖОУИ: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra! 
МОНИКА: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not? 
ДЖОУИ: Listen I uh… It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ФИБИ: What?!! 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, give me the ring back! 
ФИБИ: No!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband. 
ДЖОУИ: I understand. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. 
ФИБИ: I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered… 
ФИБИ: Ooh! A Salami Buddy! 
ДЖОУИ: There you go! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re back! 
МОНИКА: Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! Let’s stay in the kitchen! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s picture time. 
РОСС: Now you are going to love these. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here’s a picture of Ross. And that’s me. And that’s me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple. 
МОНИКА: Wow! That is a great picture! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! 
РОСС: Huh, didn’t see that coming. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need——There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now. 
МОНИКА: That would be a good idea. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together! 
МОНИКА: You kissed another woman! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Call it even?! 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
РОСС: Well, I’m gonna go get these in some water. 
ФИБИ: Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding? 
РОСС: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! 
РОСС: Hey! How you doing? 
НЕДРУГ: Good! Good, long time no see. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Like your sweater. 
РОСС: Oh hey, right back at ya. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh? 
РОСС: Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady? 
НЕДРУГ: So whose is it? 
РОСС: Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РОСС: He is so weird.
