РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey? Are you in there?
ДЖОУИ: Oh God! Thats Rachel!
МОНИКА: Joey, you have to talk to her!
ДЖОУИ: No-no, I cant! I cant! Not after the other night, its just itstoo weird, okay? Dont tell her Im here! Dont eat that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is Joey here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont see him. Do you see him?
МОНИКА: I dont see him. Hey! Maybe hes in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, at least you make each other laugh.
МОНИКА: Whats up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I havent seen him since that night that he told me how he yknow I dont know, I think hes avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
МОНИКА: We were playing a game.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
МОНИКА: Sure.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! No! No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uhtell him I miss him.
МОНИКА: Okay, did you hear that?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I dont know. Thats a pretty small hole.
МОНИКА: Honey, you gotta talk to her.
ДЖОУИ: I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
МОНИКА: Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when theyre hungry.
ДЖОУИ: All right so, so what do I do?
МОНИКА: This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know its weird, its awkward, but you gotta at least try.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We didnt play it!!
ФИБИ: Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didnt know you read tea leaves.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, Ive done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Yknow, and-and yknow, one of the great joys of life is its-its wondrous unpredictability. Yknow? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
МОНИКА: Okay, Im done. Read mine.
ФИБИ: Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
МОНИКА: I-Im the head chef. I-I cant get promoted.
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, whos next?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Im done. Do mine.
ФИБИ: Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah.
ФИБИ: Oh! Which can either mean youre having a baby or youre gonna make a scientific discovery!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does yours say Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Umm Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, Im gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And hes gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
РОСС: Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? Its a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
МОНИКА: You mean your pink shirt?
РОСС: Faded salmon color.
МОНИКА: No, I-I havent seen your pink shirt.
РОСС: Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Im sure you get another one at <i>Ann Taylors</i>.
РОСС: Thats my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
РОСС: I dont know. I mean I-I guess I could. Its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
ФИБИ: Oh wait a second you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of <i>The Village People</i>, what does that mean?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Hi.
МОНИКА: Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know its tough now, but things will get better.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
МОНИКА: Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lets just say if I cant find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
МОНИКА: Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In the James Taylor case.
МОНИКА: Where is the James Taylor CD?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
МОНИКА: Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?
МОНИКА: Hmm, I dont know. We really have to talk this through.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
МОНИКА: Okay, I-Im sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
МОНИКА: Yeah, like I dont know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I can do that.
МОНИКА: Good. Uh honey, the <i>Miami Vice</i> soundtrack? Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
МОНИКА: Uh I really dont know what to tell you Rach, I really dont. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: Yeah Joey shesRachels got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Yknow what, if were gonna make dinner were gonna have to leave. Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: So you uh, have abig work problem?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah its umm Yeah its uh It-its yknowIts nothing.
ДЖОУИ: Huh. Okay. So uh, I think Im gonna take off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: YeahNo wait! Joey no wait it is. Its something. Its-its ummits my boss.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and umm my baby.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My boss wants to buy my baby!
ДЖОУИ: What?! Oh my-oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know I told you, its a really big problem.
ДЖОУИ: What he wants to buy your baby?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can you believe that?!
ДЖОУИ: Thats crazy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thats what I told him!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, how did this even happen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Ill tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wifeThey-they cant have children. So umm, and thatwe were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
ДЖОУИ: Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that wouldve been a much simpler problem.
ФИБИ: Oh hello.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, its you. I see you everywhere. Im Jim, Jim Nelson.
ФИБИ: Oh Jim, Jim Nelson Im Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
НЕДРУГ: We have. Maybe well be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 oclock?
ФИБИ: Well, maybe we will. Oh!
РОСС: Mona? Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
НЕДРУГ: I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, its okay.
НЕДРУГ: No, its still wet. Yknow what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt.
НЕДРУГ: No-no thats a mans shirt.
НЕДРУГ: Its awfully pink.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the <i>Annie</i> soundtrack.
МОНИКА: Honey, both yours.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
МОНИКА: Yeah? The work problem?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What problem did you tell him you had?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
НЕДРУГ: May I help you?
ДЖОУИ: Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
ФИБИ: Isnt it funny how we kept running into each other? Its as if someone really wants us to be together.
НЕДРУГ: Someone does. Me.
ФИБИ: Oh, witty banter. Well done.
НЕДРУГ: So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
ФИБИ: Oh okay, well Im a masseuse, and I used to work at this place
НЕДРУГ: Do you like to party?
ФИБИ: I-I-I like, I like parties.
НЕДРУГ: Youre wild, arent ya?
ФИБИ: Yeah I guess, a little.
НЕДРУГ: It aint no thing, Im wild too.
ФИБИ: So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for ummWell since I was fourteen.
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry. Im staring. Its just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
ФИБИ: Oh stop it.
НЕДРУГ: And your breasts! Hmm!!!
ФИБИ: Okay. Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why dont we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
НЕДРУГ: All right.
ФИБИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: I write erotic novels, for children.
ФИБИ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Theyre wildly unpopular.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
ФИБИ: Wow! You do?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, a Pretty Huge
ФИБИ: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: <i>The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyour bottom dollar that tomorrow</i> <i>therell be sun</i>.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
ДЖОУИ: Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Lets just say I took care of it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa-whoa-whoa, lets say more!
ДЖОУИ: Dont worry! Dont worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You dont go buying peoples babies, so back off!!"
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesnt want to buy my baby! I made that up!
ДЖОУИ: What?! Why?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldnt be awkward!
ДЖОУИ: And you couldnt think of anything else?!
МОНИКА: You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cant believe that you yelled at my boss! Im-Im gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can always sell your baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Joey, I cant believe you brought my boss into this! Im gonna get fired!
ДЖОУИ: You lied to me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, she told me too!
МОНИКА: Chandler has two copies of <i>Annie</i>!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Ross!!!
РОСС: Hello!!
НЕДРУГ: Ross, what are you doing?!
РОСС: Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Morning. You wanted to see me?
НЕДРУГ: Please, come in. Have a seat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay look Mr. Zelner
НЕДРУГ: Oh I think its best that I speak first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Ive asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God.
НЕДРУГ: If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your babyI am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, as long as we are clear about that.
ФИБИ: Oh there it is.
МОНИКА: Thats not your regular dry cleaners.
ФИБИ: I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
МОНИКА: What?!
ФИБИ: A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me? When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.
МОНИКА: Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
ФИБИ: Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.
МОНИКА: Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like <i>Disneyland</i> for me. Im-Im gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
ФИБИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!
ФИБИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
НЕДРУГ: I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
ФИБИ: A little. Now youre talking.
НЕДРУГ: Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
ФИБИ: I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.
МОНИКА: Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
ФИБИ: She mustve left.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: So? What-what-what happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, <i>Ralph Lauren</i> is really going out of there way to show theyre not in the baby buying business.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, can you give us a minute?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ill be in there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, Im really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things
ДЖОУИ: I know. I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It kinda worked. I mean yknow, I dont know about you buy I havent thought about our thing since all this.
ДЖОУИ: Hey youre right. Yeah, its kinda been like us again a little bit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I know! I miss that.
ДЖОУИ: Me too. I mean Ihavent thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didnt feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My gynecologist tried to kill me.
РОСС: Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. Im so-so sorry about yesterday. I-Im really sorry. Its just that I
НЕДРУГ: Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
РОСС: You do?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant. Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
РОСС: Oh God youre right.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go. Can I? To remember you?
