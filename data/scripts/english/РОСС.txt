Hi. I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck. No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. No I don't, to hell with her, she left me! No! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know? I don't want to be single, okay? I just. I just I just wanna be married again! Hi. You can see where he'd have trouble. Paul the Wine Guy, Paul? He finally asked you out? That'd be good. No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy! So Rachel, what're you, uh, what're you up to tonight? Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year, talk about your -big lizards. Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. Okay, sure. I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs. This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known. You guys. You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman for her. I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny. Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to to ask a woman out,, who am I gonna ask? I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. You got a job? The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'. C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut, No. No, I gotta go home sometime. Yeah. Mmm. Oh, no. No no no, go. Split it? Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. You did! Oh. I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. Oh. Listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? Okay, okay, maybe I will. Goodnight. I just grabbed a spoon. Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that, that's not why we bought the ticket. No, it's good, it is good, it's just that mm doesn't she seem a little angry? Does she. Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? No. No. Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. i. You look great. I, uh. I hate that. Ah, well, in here, anyone who, stands erect. So what's new? Still, uh. Well, you never know. How's, um, how's the family? Why why are you here, Carol? Pregnant?! Hi. Carol's pregnant. Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved, basically it's entirely up to me. Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow. I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. I- I think they're great! I, I really do. Aw, Mom. Yeah. Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. Must pee. How long was I in there? D'ya, uh, d'ya need any help? Anyway, um. So, you uh you nervous about Barry tomorrow? Mm-hmm. Mm. Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB GYN. Got me. Yeah. Yes, yes! Me either. Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur, thing, anyway. How could I forget? Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for? Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he. she, of course, she uh familiar with our, special situation? Okay, that's great. No, I'm Oh. Quack, quack. So, um so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? Marlon?! As in Mouse? Still, you you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um, how about Julia? 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table? Helen Geller? I don't think so. Thank you! What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? Well, wait a minute, wha why is she in the title? Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. Of course not, I'm, suggesting GellerWillickBunch. My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do. You uh y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. Oh my God. Well? Isn't that amazing? Then don't do that, alright? Monica. Whaddya think? Wh are you welling up? You are, you're welling up. You're gonna be an aunt. Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. What? Wh hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was it w-. Oh my God, Chi Chi! Can I use, either thumb? Easy. What is this?! Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. Hey, Pheebs. I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. What shoe? So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. You know what I like most about him, though? The way he makes me feel about myself. Well. He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first baseAlan, second baseAlan, third base-. What? Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. A thumb?! Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? If only he were a woman. Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. There y'go. Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that PopTart?. Pheebs? Hey, I might! Is there somebody else? Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were. Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. Yeah. He could row like a viking. So how'd it go? You had a rough day, huh, c'mere. Yeah, see, you took mine. Chandler, what about you? Joey, uh OMnipotent. I cannot sleep in a public place. It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. Why? Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? Oh my God, oh is today the twentieth, October twentieth? Ohhh. Today's the day Carol and I first, consummated our physical relationship. Sex. You know what, II'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. What are you doing? Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? You can totally, totally live on this. Oh, by the way, great service tonight. Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we we first y'know. Fact, she, uh she never took'em off, 'cause we-we Sorry. Sorry. Peach pit. Peach pit. That night we, uh we had. Actually, nectarines, but basically. Then, uh, then we got dressed, and II. I walked her to the -the bus stop. I'm fine. Sorry, sorry. Uh-oh. No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night. It was the first frost. Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! Pass it! Pass it! Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. Hey, this Heyy. I remember the moonlight coming through the window and her face had the most incredible glow. Look, it's just a little more complicated. Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you. My first time with Carol was. It was my first time. Hi. Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? The kid? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever -can't do it. Listen, uh gimme back my puck. 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! GIVE ME MY PUCK! Now that was fun. Okay, Monica: Right foot red. Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. Green. To the green. Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right? Multiple orgasms! Not even, say, breaking up with Janice? Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine. That guy, he burns me up. So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight? Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too? Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here? Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a, rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all, fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish? Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. Nuh-uh. So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? No. Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way. What's goin' on? Was your basket on top? So? No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine. Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry. Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh. Do you, uh, do you. Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent. Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough. Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those? Rach, have you never done this before? Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things. Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call. That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross. Uh-oh. Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh. Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done. All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink. Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone. You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part. You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen. Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine. No. Yeah. Yeah. What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way. Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen. Is it? Feels like two. What? Oh. Hel-lo! He could never get a woman like that in a million years. C'mon! C'mon! No, of course not! Yeah, yeah, it is. Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking. Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey. Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask. Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy! Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away. Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice. Monica? You're Mom. C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part? You're right, you're right, it is. So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable. Tell me why you did this again? No? What happened, big guy? It felt like a 'big guy' moment. Yeah, I mean I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it feel like your shot? She is a kook. Alright! And effciating at tonights blackout is Rabbi Tribbiani. That s my sister. Hey Phebes, what about you? Er, Disneyland, 1989, it s a small world after all. Yeah, the er, ride broke down, er so Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children, and they, they fixed the ride and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom! Step back! Well it was the only thing to do there, that didn t have a line. Come on. And you didn t marry him be-cause? Probably. But, but, you know I ll tell you something, passion is way over rated. It is, er eventually it kinds of burns out, but hopefully what you are left with is trust and security and er, well in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism! So you know for all those people who miss out on that er, passion thing, there s all that other good stuff. But er, I don t think that s gonna be you. Umm, see I see, er, big, passion in your future. Umm. I do. What? Wha. Huh Hea, whadda.me, un, ra.wadda.uhtur. why not? No no no, I am not the zone.

Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite. She's not past, she's present, she's back. I, uh, I'll go see. Now she's passed. Twice. I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh. Nono, she's gone. I thought it was gonna be a closed casket. I don't see why not. Here's my retainer! This one?

Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? Well, I'm off to Carol's. Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. Hi, is uh, is Carol here? Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull, well, not mine, but. SUSAN: Come in. Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. Kinda like a big face without skin. Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're crazy? You're not serious, I mean, you really, you really talk to it? Do you uh, do you talk about me? Really? Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this. Oh, I hate this story. I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. That's closer. Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. Ok, Mom never hit. Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but. Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid. Hello, baby. Hello, hello. And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore. Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok? Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that? Does it always, uh-? Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts. Here we come, walkin' down the-this doesn't smell like Mom's. I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese. And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so. Nah, I dunno. I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-. sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. Come here, Marcel. Sit here. Just a smidge. C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he he threw some faeces. Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you? Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates. Four. Five. Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now. Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands. Really. What, uh, what juggling thing? No. Par-tay! 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home? Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened. Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh, catch up with you later. Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas, but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back. C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. Oh, please. When did Rigatoni get back from Rome? Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?. Just a dream I had but, phew. What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place. Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. But a man can change. Anyone want me to appraise anything? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. No. It's the one he's licking. You're good. The girl on the cover with her nipples showing? When? The guy on the cover with his nipples showing? Please. Right. Uh-oh. Hey, is Chandler here? Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler, you didn't tell. Okay, 'cause I'm thinking we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right? Okay. What code? Uh, uh. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept. No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one. Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum. I don't know, God, I- well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's. Well not in the same way. Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here. Hey. Well, not playing raquetball! He didn't get the goggles! Do they wait for me to do this? Why would I tell him? Oh. You're my friend. II had to tell you. Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun.uh. I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.

We're rehearsing a Greek play. No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel? Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah! Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. You're kidding. Wow!

Well, howdya feel? Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But, we don't have to go down that road. Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those! Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! Hello! Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be, flung by now? nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration! Hey, hello! mmwa!

Paolo, II just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say. Oh you guys, II really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed. and I really think it should be me. Hey. You all right? Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. What? Huh. Ohhhh. See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. Uh, no, no, see, because not not all guys are going to be a Paolo. II'm, I'm having a boy? WhaI'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy? I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy! I'm having a boy! II'm having a boy! I'm having a son. Um. Whoa, what, what d. What were you doing seeing her boobies? Alright. Alright. We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, er, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee. Yeah? What? So he was a little analytical. That's what he does. You know, come on, he's not that bad. You see. That's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her, if I thought on any level that, that she was a Lesbian? Why? Why would I? Why? Why? Why? Why? Dhuh? That's, that's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures. Yeah. No, no, but, that's not what I was saying. Hey! I married a Lesbian to make you look good! Uhhh. Mmm. I, er, I dunno, there's something about. We're sorry Phoebes, we're sorry. So, Joey, you OK? She barely knows me. We just live in the same building. She lent me an egg once. Aw, right. Hey. An egg? I think it's insane. Hi. She said yes. I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her close, personal friend. If you wanna put a label on it. Nope, nope, that's it. Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo! Su, um, what do you do for a living? Now that is funny. Hey, do you think would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us? Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major! You did so. I swear, I swear- How long has she been in the bathroom? Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years. Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot. No, it's just you know the whole getting on with your life thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to. You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you. No but, no but. That's easy for you to say, you found one already. What's going on? Ah, the lesser-known I don't have a dream speech. Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood? OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum. Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I might introduce her to my monkey. Well, I don't know, huh-huh, but I'm hoping huh-huh. He's not going to hurt you! Keep going, Celia. Marcel. Alright. OK, um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning. Wha, what, here? Ah. Er, um. Um, uh, vulva. Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling. Shut up! It was nice. I just. I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know? Please be kidding. OK. I'm in my apartment. That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. Joey, please. Wow. I, ahem. I really don't think so. Yeah. Sure. OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this. Ahem. I want. OK, I want to, feel your, hot, soft skin with my lips. I, er. I want to take my tongue, and. and. run it all over your body until you're, trembling with, with. Funny story! Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef. Oh, I was unbelievable. I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were different characters, plot lines, themes, a motif, at one point there were villagers. Well, ahem, you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late, and we were both kind of exhausted, so. Yeah, which was nice. I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident. And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword. Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class. No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team. No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation. I know. I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's. Who's next? Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend. Like buddies. You know how close women can get. Although I was married to her. Right. A little. Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch. It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink. Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote. Relax, I'll fix it. How did he do this? You ok? You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley? Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol? No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on. What? What? Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time. I see. So what do you propose to do? Flip me for it? No, no, no-heads, heads! Susan, go deep. Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right. I'm gonna be a father. I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me. Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid? Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt. I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me. Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield. Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father. Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday? Tonight. You take your time. What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me. Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush. Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools. Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, Oh my god I'm gonna be a father kind of a thing? No, no, Dad, I was just wondering. Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father? No, we can go to Williamsburg. Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not. Hey. Well did you try calling her? Do you have a point? It's just a furball. Yours. I just got 43 points for kidney. I had a k. Where's my k? You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a k! No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do. Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart! He looks so tiny. Yeah. The doctor got the k out. He also found an m and an o. Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now. No, why? Aqui esta. Y el caso es que no le gusta la tele. Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here. Rach, did you proofread these? Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills. I don't know. No, it's not just that. It's just-I want someone who, who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who, who makes me, uh. What? Who? Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just: Hiiii! We're fine, we're fine. Uhhhh. Joey cried last night. Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.' No, women are welcome to play. Excuse me, do any of you know how to play? No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't-you can't do. Oh, you're. Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy. The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game. Well that's fine with me. Could use the money. Yeah. Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt. I'm not a nice guy. Alright boys, let's eat. You still on that? You are way off, pal. Um, no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time-not any more. I just-I. Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK-if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. Alright. I'm gonna pay for that tonight. Hey. Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those? Alright. So, Phoebs owes 7.50, Monica, you owe 10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen. So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing. Uh, to the bathroom. I want to go to the bathroom. Alright: Your money's mine, Green. Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause. I gotta flush. Oh, I am very in. No, not this time. So, what'd you have? Come on, show them to me. Show them to me! Let me see! Show them! First of all, I'm not losing. Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the. Mee mee, mee-mee mee. I'm in for fifty cents. I thought, uh, it was a fifty cent limit. No, I fold. I'm in. One. I bet two dollars. I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.  Joey, I'm a little shy. Fifteen. Thank you.  OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got? You got me. Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh, look how happy she is. Uh, bean! Bean! Marcel, bring me the rice! Come on! Bring me the rice! Come on! Good boy! Good boy! Come on, give me the rice! Thank you. Good boy! Ah I see he's finally mastered the difference between bring me the and pee in the. Bring me the and. Rache? Hi! Mmm. Really? Whoa. What, er, what happened to, er, forget relationships, I'm done with men, the whole, er, penis embargo? Mmm. Mmm. Right, right. I, I got it. I was there. Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Yes! I do! I really do! Er, in fact, it's funny. Very often, someone who you wouldn't think could, could, curl your toes, might just be the one who, er, who. gets interrupted! Hi! Alright. I've gotta go. Come on Marcel, come on. Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes we are! That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you? Huh? Pwease Aunt Monica, Pwease! Oh. Unclench. You're not even gonna be here! I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me. Well, I added the exactly like me part, but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. Well, I think it's perfect, you know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she's spent all day taking care of my monkey. Anyway, you know, I figured after work, I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there, and, er, try to woo her. Hi. Hey, how did it go today? Yeah, yeah. You, er, you want some? Er. OK. Yeah. We can do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North East, I was, er, kinda wanted to run something by you. You know how we were, er, you know, talking before, about, er, relationships and stuff, well. OK. Quick and painful. No, why? What, what? Yeah? I, I, I can't, I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment. No, no. You know what? I guess it's partially my fault, you know, I shouldn't have asked you to, er, start off with a monkey. I should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil. You've called Animal Control? Huh! Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me. That's right, cos I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! Yeah. We, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't. Cat! My uncle Marcel. Marcel! Marcel! Ah, this is ridiculous. We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone. He's, he's just gone. Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the village. And now I have a broken foot! Thank you very much! Yeah. Yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign, hey, I don't miss Marcel any more! No, no, no. No, no. This is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel Land, doing your Rachel Thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to peoples feelings, and you. I don't even want to hear it. No you're always. Oh, forget it, OK? What, what, what? Hey! Bananaman! Hi! Did you order some bananas? Give me my monkey back! Marcel? Marcel? OK. Where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel! What have you done to him? Are you insane? Come here Marcel, come on. Come here Marcel. OK. Give me my monkey back! Alright. I want my monkey! You had to be a bitch in high school. You couldn't have been fat! Hey, It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it, or we can leave it on for now. That's fine. Listen. I'm. I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, you know, I just. No, no. Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, you know, you, you, you were great. Hey, we, er, we still have that, er, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for something grape? Alright. Er Gets wine, glasses, and turns down the lights. The, er, the neighbours must be vacuuming! Well, er, so long as we're here, and, er, not on the subject, erm, I was thinking about, er, how mad we got at each other, before, and, erm, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, er, how we.  We have got to start locking that door! I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're. I can't believe it! He's looking right at us! Okay, okay, what's going on? Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just. What? What? What?! That's nice, now, was that before or after you told him to. That's, that's nice twice! What was with the dishes? desperate, needy, pathetic? You you had what? What, uh, what were you thinking? No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol! It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Four letters: Circle or hoop. Thanks. Heating device. Five letters. I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut? Second date! I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back come here, Marcel. What? It's, it's just a phase. Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. What? Hi. At the vet. She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. I'm gonna have to give him up. I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg. No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some, monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo. Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego, right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer. Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him? Where exactly is your zoo? Yes. Nono, he's, he's very docile. Well I, I don't know. Why? He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean. Why why why would he need a blade? He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. Just, just say what you feel. That was good. Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would okay, just take him away. Just take him. Why, why, why would you dream that? I love it, when we share. I can't belive you two had sex in her dream. Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press? Oh, it's my new beeper. No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55JIMBO. College? Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time. Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr' is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure. No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services. Yeah, you want 55JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye. Oh, oh Chandler. 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.' Okay, Andr' should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way. Was there uh, huh, huh, huh, andybody, anybody else there. You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything? Huh! Are you not seeing him anymore? Oh, yeah. It's morphin time! Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it. Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. I thought that was just a rumour. Are you're hands still wet? I'm here. What? Great, now I'm having a baby. Ooh, Ooh. I'm having. I'm having a baby. I'm having a. Where's the phone? The phone? I'm hurt. Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.

Get out Let's go, come on. I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucous plug. God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.

We never landed on Jordie, we just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco. I got it. I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. Why? No, you started it. But. Thanks a lot. Yeah, listen. Please. This is so your fault. Look, Carol never threw me out of her room before you came along. You tryin' to be clever? Oh, I'm threatened by you? Yeah, Susan. I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow. Help! Help! Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be like the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok, where does that leave me? Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. You wanna explain that? Ok, got the vent open. Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben. Pheebs, It's open!

Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. No, this is pretty much it. All right, I'll see you guys later. And here's little Ben nodding off. That would be nice. What kind of research? Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. Hey. Hey. I'm going to China. Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's-- it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh, like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary. Um, here's a picture of me.  Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me? Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. Oh. Hey, who's Carl? No. At the coffeehouse, right. OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys. Hi. I have to go to China. No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is? Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight. Yeah. I guess. I don't-I don't know. Alright, just, just give her this for me, OK? I know. Ni-chou chi-ma! I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. Fine, just stop thinking about me. Can't do it, can you? I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway? Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. No, no, no, why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, II've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. I know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up? No. But, it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean, so, the only question is, are you attracted to me? Well, start looking. Oh, hey, hey, I got that. No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends. Yeah. No, no, they will. I just, uh. Come on, they're gonna love you. Rache! It was, it was great. Oh, what happened? You're bleeding. Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel. That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie. And bus. You gotta hear this story. But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby. Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time. Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee? Thank you. I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? It was you, pal. Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. I didn't order lemonade. But. How is that the silver lining? Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. Hello? Hi. Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y. Rachel! I'll just call her back. Hi. Sorry we're late but we were-well, there was touching. Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here? So, uh, he's back. No, not a problem. How's the hair? Hey, what's goin' on? What? what? Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you? I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache. Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by bye! What's goin' on? Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot? Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking Oh my god, I'm with Rachel. You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all? What are you guys doing? Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world. This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. Hi, honey. Hello to the rest. So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow? It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this. Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. My mommies love me. That's clever. Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that. It's breast milk. Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? No! Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. I did not freak out. Because it's breast milk. It's gross. No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults. That would be no. You've tasted it? You've tasted it. Oh, you've tasted it. Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel. Oh why?. don t tell me, because of the huge nostril thing? I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples. Not hating Yanni is not a real reason. We'll give you Janice. Sure, sweepin'. You never know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution? You don't believe in evolution? Too easy? Too. The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy? Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity. You uh, you don't believe in gravity? How can you not believe in evolution? Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time. You bet. In the U. S, China, Africa, all over. Well, there you go. Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs? Please tell me you're joking. No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because. Is there blood coming out of my ears? You remember Janice, right? Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old. It's the only possibility, Phoebe. There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility. What? You comin'? You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental. Whip it out, whip it out. Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? You were in a porno? So what's it shaped like? So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know? Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? OK sweetie, I'll see you later. Hey. Hey? Can I ask you somethin'? Naa. OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex? Technically, huh, no. No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. Well, you just must think I'm weird. What? Sexy? No kidding? What? You'd wait? Really? Women really want this? Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. Hi everyone. I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. Pop it in. What's wrong with people having sex? Looks to me like he's the one getting the job. Goodnight. Oh, no no, I am. Um, no, I uh, I have done it before. I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens. Wha, uhh, what? OK, now I'm nervous. No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know. What, it's not your fault. Really? Uh-huh. Ohh. Thanks Rach, goodnight. Good morning. Twice. Man, I sure miss Julie. You ever figure out what that thing's for? I know. Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob. Oh my god. You are pure evil. Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico. Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you? I'm tellin' you. You can't do this. That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness. Go over there and tell that woman the truth. Go. Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef-. Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing. Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister. That's fine, I'll just wait! Monica! Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine? Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls? That sounds great. Same for me. Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks. Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay. So five of us is, 33.50 apiece. Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal. Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine. I hear ya. I, I just never think of money as an issue. That's a good point. Wha-? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative-there's gonna be a hoopla? G-gift? The thing's not the gift? Hootie and the-oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio. No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together. Not at the concert. Whoo! But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope? Come on. Could you be less enthused? We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here. I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys. Fine. Chandler! Geez! Are you ready? Whoa! You had sex today? Wow. Still doing the screening thing? Bumpy? Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. Excellent, that was excellent. What guys? Oh, yeah. Ross. Hey, you guys. Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night? Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust. It wasn't so much a party as a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band. Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know. Let me hold him for a sec. There. Huh? There we are. Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants. There we go. All better. Come on, don't do this. I don't know. What's in this pie? Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie. And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi. Ugh. Ugh. It's definitely getting worse. Either that or my mouth is getting smaller. You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble? What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital. I don't think tho. Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.  Thro up a thro thro-a thro thro! Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? Tho? Ohhh. Ok. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand. Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand? Oh. Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? I hope Ben has a little sister. I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken? They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it. I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today? Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus-Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt? Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here. Hi guys. Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK? Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy. Uh, actually, we're getting a cat. Uh huh. Yep. Hopefully. Hey Rach. Oh. And how was the date? Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. What? Why, why are you looking at me like that? OK. Oh, oh, oh. No, I stayed at Julie's last night. Oh actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages? Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael? You're over me? Wha, you're uh, you're, you're over me? When, when were you, under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you uh. What? You've had feelings for me? Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had, you know? Chandler. When did he, when did he, when did he. China. Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha, and now, now, now you're over me? That's, that's Julie. Ju, Julie, Julie. Hi Julie. I'll be right down. Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, ya know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm, I'm gonna go get a cat. Cat. I didn't get a cat. No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. Then you should have said something before I met her. There was never a good time. Not, not, not every night. You know, and, and it's not like I didn't try Rachel but things got in the way, ya know, like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys. The point is I, I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it. Fine. Good. Try the bottom one. And, uh, and then I kissed her. Yeah. Hi. That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful. Yeah, it was, but. I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away? Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. How are you? Good. Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you? Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe? Play it. Ssshh. I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare. Can't we just use a pen? I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes. And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress. I don't know. She's not Rachel. Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing. Hi. I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's. No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing. Well, uh. Really. It's always been you, Rache. I know, I know, it's, it's almost what do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them? Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat. Hey, someone order a coat? He won't, he won't. Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing? That's it? That's all you wrote? You are the worst writer in the whole world. No, you don't. Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok? Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type little, the idiot. No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rache? No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column. No, Rache, come on. Rache! Rache, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra-Rachel? Rache! Whoops! Rache, hey, open up, please! I just wanna read something. It's your pro-list. Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben. Number six: the way you smell. Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window? I am, uh, I am. Rache, come on, open up. Rache, come on, come on, Rache. You got to give me another chance. No? rache, come on, look, I know how you must feel. No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things. You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you. Hi. Look, can, can you do something for me? So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies? Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme. Hey guys. Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's, just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place? Here, go nuts. Hey guys.

Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings. Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet? Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping? Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me. C'mon Rachel. See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said. C'mon, just tell me, please, please. Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is, off. No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and, here it is. It uhh, it won't go back. Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal. OK, tip the man. Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon. It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much? Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK. Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything. Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas. No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now? Yeah. You mean hardball? Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting? Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go. Are you OK? You got me a cola drink? Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater. I don't want to. Yeah. Oh c'mon, maybe your just, uhh, your just paying your dues. Hhiii. Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegasaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Woah, woah, I know this jacket, this is, th. Fun Bobby's jacket, where is he, what. He, he's here isn't he? Don't toy with me. Hey, Fun Bobby! Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear your back with my sister. Oooh. Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a, a drink in his hand. What, what's wrong? Alright. Hi. Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachels? A date. Oh, oh you're uh, you're, oh you're the date. Yes, yes I am. And you are a. Well, I am going to, uhh, get a beverage. It was nice, nice, uh, meeting you.

Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum who's curator of moths and other, uh, winged things, who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a, well you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay but, uh, if this is the deal. OK, well, um, have a nice evening. She's dating, she's dating. Whad'ya mean? See what? I don't know what she sees in innn that goober. And it takes him what like, like, I don't know, uhh-huhh, hello, a week to get out a sentence. Yeah. Disprosium. Try mendelevium.

As in, I now pronounce you wife and wife married? Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding. No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me! Mmm hmmm. Uh-huh. This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television. Would it matter? I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married? If you wanna call that a reason. Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. Excellent! That is so good! Do it again! No no, that's me. Oh, hello. Is everything ok? Oh my god. Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Hi, Mrs. Green. And you had no idea they weren't getting along? No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. What's the matter? What? Carol, what's the matter? What happened? Oh my god. It's ok. I'm sorry. I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right. Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this. Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it. Any time. Yeah, can't help but. Ok. Yeah. No, that's fine. Ok. Well, Mon, I was married. That commercial always makes me so sad. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. Hey guys. Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L. A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel. Oh my God, what happened? I can't believe this. Well, ya know, someone should have called me. Zoo dollars? I was thinkin' about it. Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars? Buddy, my monkey? Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. That guy Lipson? No, I, I only know Lipson. Buddy, my monkey, my monkey. Of course. This is unbelievable. Are you trying to get me to bribe you? But you already told me everything. Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey. Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is. Well, there goes my whole belief system. That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin. Hans. Hans. Yo evil twin. Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan. I know. This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year. Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey? Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his.

Open it, open in. Woah. Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due. What, woah, woah, 3500 at porcelain safari? Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World. That audition. Joey, you owe 1100 at I Love Lucite. So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money. Toilet paper? Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic. I am your friend. But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe 2300 at Isn't it Chromantic. Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another. Huh, I'm just saying. Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go. Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok. Oh my God, what's goin' on? No look I wasn't right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey. Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition. Great, how did it go? Good for you. You're livin' the dream. All right then. What? Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird? Dollars? You spent 1200 dollars on a plastic bird? Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200? Huh. I'll take it. My gift to you man. What're you talkin' about? Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end? No no, you're fine, you're fine. Hi. Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened. Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it. I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour? Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen, I mean, I feel like. Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared. Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good. Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg. Buy mommy. Have a good time. Ok, Ben. Yeah. Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula. Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler. Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. Thank you. Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but. Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off. What're you doing? Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb. Well just hold him like you'd hold a football. Ok, here, here. There we go. It's alright, it's no big deal. Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. What? Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive. Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale. Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. Huh? Ok, what the hell happened back there? Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. C'mon, what, you never think about our future? No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good. The big book of childrens' names. Yeah. Ok fine. We're not done. Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that. Good, 'cause I love you. Yeah. Well that's the first time we've said that. Well, I'm gonna kiss you. Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail. Hello. Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. Wha, what? What, the word hi? Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything. Something about hi. Well, this was fun.

Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee. Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat. Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler. It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore. Hi. What? Do you say this stuff to girls? You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door. Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat. Thank you Gunther.

I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. Yeah, sure. No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'. Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take? I think we proved our point. Cannot feel my tounge. Yes, and that's why we're here. Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon? Whad'ya mean? Before I forget, are we hitting faces? Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.

Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend. Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers. No, Rach! Marenge, Everybody! Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind. All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes. I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison. Hey Mon! Nope. Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so. Getting it away from me would be job one. You need to get some sleep. Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her. Hmm? Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place. I think I have an old band uniform from high school. Yeah. What? No. Nope. What? Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi? Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut?

Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter. Okay. Hi. Guess what? They published my paper. How could you have told her? Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal. Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us. That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'. Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her. Noo! Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything? Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times? I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think. Women tell each other everything. Did you know that? No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth. Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna? Nooo! Yeah? Okay, okay, I'll go first. So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing. Yes! Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy.

Phoebe you, oh, you are my star. You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So. That's, that's funny.

Okay, hold my crawler. Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one? Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery. Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Um, yeah. Um, no. But, okay. Um, see, but that's not the final draft. Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local. What? We're just gonna be friends. I’m sorry the answer there would be none of us. Yeah, I’ll take some. What? Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore. Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now. Hey. So how many more do you have tomorrow? Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices. I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo. Oh, better, actually. Y'know III think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately. Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and III think it’s gonna make a difference. No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye. I don’t know, something girlie. Hi. Where is everybody? My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over. ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation. I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool! Well, now I do! Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’veI’ve ever. Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I, had a uterus. I can’t believe this! Thanks. Thanks. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. My foot is stuck in the pocket. No, I can’t get it out. No, come on don’t start. Ouch! Stupid balls are in the way. Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution. Huh? My wife’s a lesbian. Hi. So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out. Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie. We? Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry. Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'. Fine. Hi Gunther. What? Come on! That's great. Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students. Nice to see you again Dr. Green. Ugh, museum. There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one. Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke. It's not a library. So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat. It gives it a nice antiquey look. Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. Okay! Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent. That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress. So? You really serve people sneezers? Thanks again, Dr. Green. Oh, ah, you don't need that. The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness. Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem II tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really. I know. Nothing I do means anything, really. Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'. Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food. Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work. Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!' Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along. Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels. Dr. Green. How are you? Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore. Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go. Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that. Thank you! That's what I keep saying. Uh. And his first name. Oh-ho please. Ask her how? Argue with that. I know that! What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either. Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice? Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see? Excellent! Neither will I. So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one. Why? Why can't you go to him? Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence. Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too? No, no he's not. What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler? Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display. Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that. Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you. You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. Yeah. Hmm? Joey, Homo Sapiens are people. Hey! Everyone. How's my little boy? What'd you do, take him whaling? Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben. And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving. Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head? It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could. I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time. Monica did it? Monica? Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today? Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head. Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know. Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow! Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance! He does not look happy. Halftime. What? Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football. It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running. Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking. Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup? Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and, threw it in the lake. Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again. Can I see you for a second? All right, we're gonna play. Here you go. Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler. Sweetie, now I pick you. Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off. Oww! Son of a.! Ow! Come on! Come on, let's go! Yeah, losers talk! Yeah! Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break! You, you go long. Until we start to look very small. Break! OneMississippi, twoMississippi, switch! Switch! Switch! Uh, hello, it's third down. Wow! It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this. Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need. Well, I said it loud. Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie. Well ah, you wanna just stay out there? Yeah. Okay. Hut! Hike! Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count. Before the snap! Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count. Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater. Oh-ho, okay. Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win. Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands! Oh really! Why is that? The Geller Cup. Okay, where in the hell did you get that?! That cup is mine! Chandler! Chandler! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling? Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough. Hey, where'd you get that? It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team. What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns. Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me. Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go. Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys. Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like? Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill. Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls. Hey! It's 42-21! Let go! Let go! No! You let go! How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball? Hey! It's starting to snow. Gimme the this! Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand. Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl, is not a backhand. All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache. I know. I feel horrible. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like? All right, see you guys. So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore. Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India. Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? Yeah. Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes? And what is second prize? Well, that makes sense. Yeah, Sarah, anything. Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies. No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird. Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs. No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world. Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going. All right! and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus. Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you? No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night. Mon? Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's. Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em. I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free. Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em! and 12, 22, 18, four. What? Ah, we're out. I sold them all. Monica, I'm cutting you off. Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck. Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes! Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!' Well hey, who did these resumes for ya? Well you sure used a large font. Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay. What, that wasn't the great news? Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell? Hey now! That was an accident, okay. What's a scrud? I don't have too. I can just look at you. Not nice enough. Good for a scrud. That's crap! Sister Brown Bird. Good going. Hi there! Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious, nuget, diffency. Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes. Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out. That word was swans. No. I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp! Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown! Oh no! An asteroid! Real magic does exist. Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling. Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then. Oh, somebody's feeling better. Hi! Wow! What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason? And he's, he's a total stranger? Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex. Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason. Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason? Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me? Uh-huh. Hi. Yeah. So um, II heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today. Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy. That's excellent. So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him? Yeah. You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men! Which one is Gina? That's okay. Hey, Joey. Ah, which, which one? MaryAngela. Dear MaryAngela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for MaryAngela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. Where in Cuba? Bummer. No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you. But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy. What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home? That's right good things, that-that is what I said. That is so made up! There you go. Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less. High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro. You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way? 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend! Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal. No. Well, yeah! You grow up. Hi! Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I. Hi. How'd did it go? I'm so proud of you. Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so. Yeah. Congradu! -lations-lations. Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it? Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too? Ah, we'll all go. Come on. It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! Why? Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. Hmm? Oh, yeah. Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm, why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch? Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do? Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. Hi, is Rachel there? This is Ross? Of Ross and Rachel. Oh hey, hey Mark. Okay. Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?

It's from Ross, it's a love bug. I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! I mean my God. can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre! I would never do that! Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. Why?! How?! How is he a genius? What am I going to do? I don't know you guys. All right that's, that's it! Get off her! What's going on?! That's what's going on! I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach. Hi. I'm sorry, I was an idiot. A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me. Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. Yeah. Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay? Ahh, no. Are you jealous? You are totally jealous. Honey, I love you too. What? Huh. What are you doing? No thanks. I'm 29. Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight? Oh come on, not again. Hmm. Yeah.

How'd the ah, basketball go? Calm down. There's no reason to get testy. Good. Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson? Oh. He's right, even if it's to say something complementary. Hey, don't we have to. Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more, y'know, and you're more. Hi. Hello. Yeah, huh. What? Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time? But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya? Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye. Okay. Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today.

Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him? Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean. Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing? Pa-haa! I would love to go with you. Yeah, hey II have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion, monger. What should I wear, now I'm all nervous. I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you. So I nodded off a little. Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses. First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly. Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka. No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. No. I. I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. III know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it. That's a little clearer. Sure, III. Is everything okay? Hey. What is ah, Rach in her room? Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary? What's that on the bottom? Hey, honey.

But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again. Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes? What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes? Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week. Yeah, but wait. Hey. No, hey, well, II completely understand. You were, you were stressed. For what? For letting you throw me out of your office? Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel. No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job! Yes. No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore. Is this about Mark? Okay, it's not, it's not. Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do. Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.

Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. Yes, you can, very much. Ahhhh! You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did. What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other? Yeah, but don’t you think. Yeah, okay. What trail? Oh, II don’t think there’s any trail. Chloe? Hi. You took my watch? Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right? You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met. Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see II happen to have a girlfriend. Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her. Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself? Actually, no, we’re not. No, we’re not. No, we’re not! Right. Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister. Jasmine? We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller. Yes, I did. Very bad. I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet? Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay? Thank you, thank you. Who’s your roommate? Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place. Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please! Rachel? No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay? No! No! No! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this. What? She was. She, she was different. Nobody likes change. What? Okay, okay, okay, okay. I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I waI was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible. Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me! Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up. That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up. Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead! Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen! Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, II did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to. Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark? Yes I would. Yes. La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you. What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking? Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’ Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself. No anchovies. That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off. You can have the last piece, if you want. What, now you’re not even taking to me? Look Rachel, II’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? II don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey! Y'know what, y'know what, I’mI’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough! That’s what?! Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much. Okay, okay, okay. What? Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together. Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and. Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean. Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks. Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it’ll be great! No, no, no, this weekend guys! What’s going on? So, for the whole weekend? Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand. What a pity stay? Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays. Hey.

Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up. Yeah, well. Oh yeah, I’d love that. I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan. 717? Where’s 717? Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right? Pheebs? What, why are you whispering? Oh, now you want a favour? Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?

Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin? Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills. All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready. You’re welcome. We were on a break! Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me. That’s what you said last night. Okay. Obviously not to Joey. Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no. I can. Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go. No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise. Okay. Okay. That would be great. I know! Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping? Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.

And so now you guys are gonna be married? Pheebs, what, is it the age thing? Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.

Hey guys! Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign. He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin, abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name. Yeah, that'd be cool! Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!

Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again. Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry. Okay, we’ll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? Well, this is ironic.

I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you! She said you gave her the razor! Ahh, no, I'm good. Okay, have fun! Wooo! You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!

What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together? What?! What? That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing. I know, but ahhh! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss! Good night. Okey-dokey! Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so, y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again? Yeah. Hi. Hi! Awww. Yeah. I know. Okay, I gotta go. Well, II gotta go break up with Bonnie. Well, yeah. I can'tI can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna, do stuff. No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her. Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that? Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning. Okay. It's over. Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab she just left. Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby. Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting. Oh. Oh-oh. Done! Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice! I'm sorry. Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance. No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it, does. Oh, sure! I'm sure. Hey! What happened? It does. It really and truly does. It so does not! She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK! Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, If you accept full responsibility. Full responsibility! I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?! Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this. What the hell happened on that beach?! Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing? What happened? Joey? Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you. Ewwww! You peed on yourself?! I missed you too. I suppose. Umm-hmm. WE WERE ON A BREAK! And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship! I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter! I fell asleep! It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, YOU-apostropheRE means 'you are,' YOUR means 'your!' FINE BY ME! Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter! Who's Chip? The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you? Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school! I was just leaving. Why? Did you write it? Well ah, actually. Well, umm, why don't you give him a call? Oh, I'm sure. Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing! Hey, here's a question where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi? I'm reading your ad. Yeah. Good, so do I. Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again? So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center? So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us? So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat? Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat! No you don't. No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this. I do not always have to be-okay, okay. Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio. Yes, we have to tell her! Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her. Thank you. Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say? You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs? Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place. No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat! None. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother. Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon. Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do. I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional. The volcano? With such a sad history. So why don t you quit? Who is Maria? You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand? So you re strong enough to face her on your own? They make you take an oath? Then how do you explain the toe ring?! Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong. One more time, Hey, don t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs? Good! That s good! Me? No. It s okay man, be strong. No! And I m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech. And that s funny, why? Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source. And that s not against your oath?! Hello. We d like to close our accounts. No-no. No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account. Hello! What's this? Oh right it s that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but. Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and II go and drop it. Oh, mine's December. Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda. Good luck! Come on, Pheebs lay off him. Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, cause he's so in love. Hey! So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight! Oh. Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little playing ourselves. Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something. Oh! Monica knows. Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just head. Hi! Wow! You-you look great! Okay! Hey Tommy. Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure. What? III. Who wants to make some long distance calls? Her date tipped me ten dollars. Pheebs, what are you doing? Are you serious? Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight? At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies. You see Amanda and I have a very special. Fine. Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship. You're welcome for a delicious dinner. I know! Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era. I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow. Fine by me hope she wins. How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? So, uh, why did you have to turn it down? Huh.

Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh. Oh, yeah, why not? You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here. What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there. No, I tried that.

See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won t play anymore. Yeah, okay. Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice. What? No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would ve just stepped aside. Well, I saidI said something to Phoebe. Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this. Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y know, I m not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set? Yeah, like I could lose it. I played bad on purpose guys. Yeah, no, just that last song. Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office? Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that. Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly! So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch. Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me? Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me. Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back. Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year. Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh. Hey! What are you doing? Everything? Even the TV? Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out? That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him? You've sentenced him?! Joey, the guy's your best friend. Oh, who? Me? Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend? I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler. He's coming here for Thanksgiving! Yeah. Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather. Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it? I just wanna check something. Now, we'll see. The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver. Oh my God! You actually exchanged it! What did you get? Hey. Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em? Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them. There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings. I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that. He's taking her purse! What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van! I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch. Nooo! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town? Dude, we are sooo gonna party! Mike Gandolf Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world. I'm gonna call after you! Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard! Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school? Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit! Somewhere maybe along the equator? What happened? Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky! It's Gandolf, and he's not coming. No! I balanced my checkbook. I can't believe he didn't come! Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them! There's other stuff too. Yeah! Yeah! It's not like we don't know how to party! Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat? Yeah. Okay. I'm kinda beat. Yeah, me too. I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place. How sad are we? And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath! Hey! I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything? 15? Your personal best! Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate. Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. Oh, wow! I should get going. II got a date tonight. You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and II can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun. Well, II want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist. Hey! I wasn't sleeping. The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date. No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought, it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn. Y'know, you're right. Thank you. What? What? Are we really in Montreal?! Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal? What? Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period. Oh my God. Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else. The stuff I just mentioned. Yeah, that is nice, lying! No way is that the reason. And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes. Yeah, I was going for the metaphor. Just go for it Chandler. That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later. Hey. Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria. It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides never sit together. It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right? Thank you Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table in the middle. I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me. You know, we work in the Museum of Natural History, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see? I see division. Division between people with white coats and people in blue blazers. And I ask, myself, my God, WHY? Now I say, we shed these coats that separate us and get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross. I'm divorced, and I have a kid. All right, there you go. Okay, okay, good for you. oh, uh, er, Wow, Rhonda. Ah, okay Scott! Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?

So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am! Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle. They don't look any bigger than me! All right. Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross! Come on!

I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks. Please! Are you kidding? II hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose, I mean II'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you. No, no, I'm serious. Thank you. It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not. Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the CupertHewitt museum. Yeah. Bye. Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it. Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know. Pheebs! Hello! Hello! Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party. You really didn’t know? So we should probably get going soon. Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner. No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, Surprise! And then, Oh my God, I’m so surprised, good-bye! Monica said that did she? Yes, we have something we have to get to. What big thing? Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play. Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away. That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so. Yeah. Helps a little. Yeah, have a seat. That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know? What do you mean? Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment. You think? Hey, you’re right. Thanks. What photo album was it? Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! Hi. So uh, Emily just went to the airport. Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so. Nah. Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy! And why do you care so much? You had fantasies about Emily? Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid? Ahh. We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know? What-what is love really? I am a good kisser. Emily! I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off. That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you. Wait uh, listen. II, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? III ah, II think I love you. That’s no problem. I did. Thank you. She said, Thank you. I said, I love you. And she said, Thank you. What do I do now? She already lives in London. Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over. Hello? Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight? No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called. Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America? She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy. Well? I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall! No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard! What? I made fun of his accent. No. Really? All right. All right, I’m gonna do it! I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her. Hey. No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment! About four hours. I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can’t hear me. Hi. Ohh! Thank you. Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra. Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice? Hey, uh, you can ignore that. Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand. I’ll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan. Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so. Oh come on! That’s-that’s, true. Hey! So uh, Emily called last night. Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding! Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great. Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful, didn’t you see Personal Best? How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her! What a weird way to kick me when I’m down. Oh. What’s wrong with Ross? Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found, Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. Hey! Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, No. I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, No. I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, No. So, he’s sweeping. So umm, any word from Susan? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun? Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married. Am I?! Am I?! Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else. There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening? OH MY GOD! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it! So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together! Oh, wake up! Excuse me? Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person. What? It does not! This is not fun! Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing. Nice luggage. Hi! Oh, I missed you too. No tongue. Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowie? Uh, I don’t know, whatever. Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’mI’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! II love that guy! Yeah? Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day. One more day, seriously. So, then you can stay as long as you want. Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on. No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy. Hey, guys! Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it. I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing? Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle. Yeah! Yeah! I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off. Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here! I could ask her to live with me! I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?! Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean III love her, y’know? I don’t want to do that. Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. Hey! Move in with me. Don’t be scared, II know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be. I know. Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs that could be you! No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here I can’t leave him. Isn’t, you don’t think there’s any way? What? No, no, don’t. Why don’t we? Get married. No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want. Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it? Is that, are you saying yes? Is that yes? Yes! We’re getting married?! Yes! Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me? Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell! Come on! Come on. Come on. Hey! Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married. We, we just decided to uh, to go for it. Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys. Yeah. Hey guys! Oh no, not yet. Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach? Yeah, oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London. Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress. Thank you. What’s wah-pah? Hey! Hey, do uh, do you have a minute? So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were. I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda, y’know. Yeah? All right, I just wanted to check. You’re great. And II know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there. Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh. Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet. Oh. Yeah? Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible. Uh-huh. I gotta get to work. Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy? If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night? Yeah, all right, it’s a date. Did you say something? Hey man. So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today? Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month! Yep! Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so, I mean, II know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know? Hey! So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock? Oh, see II don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three. What happened? Noo. Why? Oh, Rachel, I’mI’m sorry. Come here. Yeah. You okay? Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? Yeah? Sure. Why not? Yeah? Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her? Yeah sure. Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want. I don't want to be single, okay? I just. I just I just wanna be married again! Hi. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. You did! Oh. I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. Oh. Listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? Okay, okay, maybe I will.  See, I see, big passion in your future. I do. Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as, more of a general wondering, ment. OK. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um. Yes, yes, that's right. What? Ow! You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen. Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine. You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. The point is I. I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. Fine. Good. No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.

It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right. Uh-huh, I see that. What? What? Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think. Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place? She said what? Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents. I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This. No. I'm saying it's now. He starts putting on his pants, backwards. There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?! Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily. Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?! Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you. Yeah. I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just. Excuse me? I don't know. A month? I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were. Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay? Come on. Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer. But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at. And, I don't know, if it starts to rain. Hi. Mom. Dad. what's up, Dad? Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to. Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue. I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face. Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle. I'm getting married today! Whoo-hoo! I'm getting married, to.day! Ahh, whoo-hoo! He runs back out the door. I do. I do. I do. Really? Dad! Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control. Okay! Okay! That's it! Parents! Parents! It was. This disagreement over. She sighs. Ross notices. You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have. My God. Rachel! He walks towards her, grasps her hands and kisses. I Ross. Take thee, Rachel. All his friends have looks of shock on their. I Ross. Take thee, Rachel. Emily. Emily. I, Ross. Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else. As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. Happy too. Yay! Okay. That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it? That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup. And, I love you! That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance! Hi! Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right? No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you. But it absolutely didn't. It didn't! It didn't! Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, II-we gotta do what the band saysI don't care about the stupid band! Look, I'm sorry. Oh, right! Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. Emily?! No, I've looked everywhere! No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here. Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while? That's cool. Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt. EmEmily? EmEmily? Emily! Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she? Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that. Rach! Rach! Hi! What are you, what are you doing here? Oh. Not yet. Pretty soon I guess. I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up? Same difference. I get it! Well, that's that. What? Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know. I could, yeah, I can do that. I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go! I know, why not? Right? Y'know-thanks! Yeah, well, nah. Why don't you come, I mean, II have two tickets, why not? Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes? No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend. Okay! Cool! Come on! Here. Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket! You tell them to wait! Emily. Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily! Hey! Yeah! Ohh! Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center. Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now? Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad? Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, II did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that? No, not since I lost her at the airport. HEY, SHE'S FAST! OKAY?! Oh! You-you think you can be-beat me? Let's go! Outside! Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry. That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible. So, what? That's it? Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again. Hi. She's doing her laundry. It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch! Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while. I can't catch a break! What thing? Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre. Hey everybody, Pheebs is here! Wait! It was my plan. And, I came up with Atlantic City. The paper. Events from around the globe. Sure. Once, at work II thought carbon dating was fossilized. Yeah. Go ahead. Wow. Umm. Huh? I'mI'm not sure what to do with that right now. What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean. Why are you laughing? Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding. Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. Hey Ross, where's the Mrs? Don't know! Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is. That is what the thing is. No. No. No, I'mI'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you. No thank you for. Thank you. Okay, let's go! Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now. It's all right. Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did! Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head. Look, PheebsPheebs, it's gonna be okay. Yeah, he's head of the department. Hello. Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway? To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie. Again, it's not that he. Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang. Hey! I just heard. What's up? Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain. I do too! I do too! Argh! Argh! You did it, man. I had to talk loud because the movie was loud! III don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit! Hello. Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi! No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me! Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? II love you. II really miss you. She's talking. Hi! Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship. In London! She wants me to move to London. I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben. It could happen. All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben. Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that? Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out. All right, did you just say all right? Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love! Yes, tell me. I know. I am, I am so sorry. Again, very sorry. Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you. Oh that is so great! That's. So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes. No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again. I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you! Thanks for the help, problem solved. Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause II got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken! For what? Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily. It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff. Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants. No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help. Thanks. Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York? Hey. Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her. Damn! I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it. Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the I get to see my wife, part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. I have no idea. I mean. But-but I assure you I will figure it out. So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right? Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily. What?! Le Poo's still alive?! Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about? Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing. Okay, here goes. I made a promise that-Oh hey! You're nose is bleeding! Umm. Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore. Hey. Rachel, III've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out. Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage? And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants. is for me not to see you anymore. It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here. You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard. What are you doing? Rachel, this is your apartment. You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do. Yes! Please! That's okay. That's not advice! I'm going to the bathroom. Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec? Hi. I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back. No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better? Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do? I can't believe this is happening. I am so sorry. Hey! How come? Everybody else does. Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things. Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new. Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on. Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine. After what I did? Can you blame her? No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo! Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other. Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. II've been given the gift of time! I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, BenBen took his first steps right over there. I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice. Why? What's going on? Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! Yep. Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood. Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now. Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur? You do, huh? What are you talking about? Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh. It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed. Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back! Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on. Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! Yeah, yeah, she's here. Hi. Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay? Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'mI'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with. Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me. So, can you trust me? Well, I guess that's it. My marriage is over. Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther. Emily's cousin kicked me out! Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. Who needs a lease when it's family! You got it. Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad. What? Hey roomies! Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here. Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back! Pretty cool, huh? Joey, please! Uh fellas, I'll take sports. All right. Uhh, international. Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here. Oh yeah! You're hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks! Oh, II don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio. Okay, let's go. Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it. Oh my God! I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking. So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place? How about you? All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application. Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application. Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So. Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space. Are you guys sure about this? All right. So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just. Come on, it's fun! I couldn't possibly eat another bite. Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm. I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever. Oh God, no. You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings. In this life, Phoebe. Yeah that's the same. Hey! Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band! Oh, this is Monica. Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food. So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college. Well, that's cool. So did. Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for. Monica! So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week. Yeah. Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night. All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind. Hey! I can't believe you let George Michael slap you. Hey. Happy Thanksgiving! So uh, where's Monica? Dude! Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams! Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it! Sir LimpsALot, I came up with that. Well, they're not mine! Why are they here? Hi. Someone at work ate my sandwich! My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it! Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life! That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. II still can't believe someone ate it! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, Keep your mitts off my grub? Phoebe! Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that. That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now! Yeah, of course, Donald. What?! Yeah. Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich. Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, II put my sandwich in the fridge over here. What? You ate my sandwich? Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with aMoist Maker? Do you perhaps remember seeing a note on top of it? That said it was my sandwich?! What? You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! MY SANDWICH?! MY SANDWICH! Hey Chandler. Monica! I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today. On account of my rage. He gave me a pill for it. Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it. I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich. What's going on? Dude! That's my sister! Yeah, what's going on? You slept with my sister? This is not good for my rage. My God Monica! Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?! I reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. And top shelf: expired products. Because I am bored. Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners. Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical! So what, we just sit? I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys? Or that. I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do. Yeah! All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character. And it can't be Joey. Or Joseph. All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball. This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game! And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on! No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh! So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what? Oh-oh, yeah. Uh, you weighted 200 pounds. Yeah, not since I got too strong for you. Yeah. Oh fine. Joey's not going. Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages. I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball. I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical! And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing. If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine. How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha! No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did! Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball. Yay! I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh? All right. Hey man. About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry. Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest. But we had our best friend's interest at heart. I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry. I am sorry, Chandler. 73! 72! 71! What? Well, who's gonna kiss my sister. Awww, man! Really? That's a good point. Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe. All right. Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history. Happy New Year, Pheebs! Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99! Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy. Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution. In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week. Ohh. Okay! Hey! I just asked that girl out. Yes it is. See. That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle. Hi, Pheebs! Oh-oh, guess what? II have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle. All right, see you later. Hi! Oh see, II needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before. Okay, seriously, what do you think? What are you, what are you doing? What, to blind my child? My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot? Okay, it must just be me then. That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom? Thanks. Ahhhhh………. 'Kay! Oh my God! Joey, it's Ross! I need some help! Well, you can help me! Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom. No, II got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, II can't put them back on. I can't! Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man. Ohh, II see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work? Hold on. They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste! What difference does that make?! Dude, what am I gonna. All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off. I had a problem. This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit! Look at me! Oh, be-because of the leather pants. Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy. Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily! Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD! Hey Pheebs, what's going on? No! No! No! I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in. Actually, thanks! Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it. Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now. That's okay, Joe. Oh God! Just, y'know out. I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while. Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want! Okay, look, II know what you guys are going to say. Okay, I didn't know you would say that. Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids. I am gonna see her again. Hey guys! Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice! Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention. Thanks! Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right? Oh. This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then. Okay. Sometimes I feel. Huh? Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice. OH. MY. GOD! I am now. Dude, we got to talk. I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad? Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to. Okay. All right. Hey. Sorry. This would be the place where you explain the hat. Hey Pheebs, how's it going? Is everything okay? Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died. Your make-up! What's the part, Anti-man? Hey, how are you holding up? What happened? Wh-what did he say?! Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean III'd walk in there and I'd be like, Yo, dad! You and me outside right now! I kinda scared myself. Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings. What kind of problem? Nooooo! Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes. Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place! It would be so cool to live across from you guys! Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is! Ohh. What's going on? What?! What?! Actually, it looks really good. Hey! Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants. No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window. No. No. A basket of mini-muffins. The small one. Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day. Oh man! I want that place so much! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! Noooo. Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one! Huh? That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline. Well, he had gravity boots. Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but II will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat? Right. Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And II realize that the competition is fierce but. I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it. A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished. Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me. Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I. What? No! Wh. What are you doing?! GET OFF MY SISTER! Chandler! Chandler! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here! What the hell are doing?!

You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news! What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?! You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids. You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather? Hey! Aww. Huh. Ohh. Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again. Hi! Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe. Howard? Oh that's nice. Oh. Uhh. No-no, it's not that, it's just II just moved in. Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes. No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. II mean I don't know Howard. Yes but too me he's just, man. Ugh, can you believe that guy! so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles. It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles! Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PARTAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. Oh, no! Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture. Phoebe! What are you doing? You chipped in?! Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money! Yeah, but you're making me look bad! Phoebe? Phoebe? Phoebe?

Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit. I take it. Hey! What's up? Hey Joey! Great stuff huh? Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross. You got ink on your lip. Hey! Who isn't? I don't, I don't think we've meet. II'm Ross. Nevermind! I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm. Jen, I know this may sound a little. But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or. Umm? I will give you a call. Okay! So uhh, you ready? Sure. Joey. Man! They cannot get enough! Hi! Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute-y'know, which he is-so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning. I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings. Okay! All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition. Yeah. Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it. You're not his godfather. Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather. Really? That's great! Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, Joey, you look nothing like Ben. Hi. Not so good. Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition! Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this? Yes! I knew it! Bye-bye! So long! Later! Yeah! Yeah, it is. No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird. Seriously that's a lot of cups. Hey! What's up? Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man. Well, you just. What?! Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad. What?! And why wouldn't he get it? Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid? Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see! You're kid's name is Raymond! Joey! Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben! Hey! Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well. No really, II am! I feel bad! Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson. I think, sub-consciously. I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part. No! There you go. Thank you! No. Hey! Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion? Wow! How'd you get in there? What the hell was that?! The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?! It was totally flirting. Somebody got a haircut. Yeah, right. I'm good. And on your anniversary, for shame! Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl! Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it. Well. Well, II was watching her the other day at the pizza place. And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little. This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the CharmORoss.

The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair. You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys. You couldn't let me have her, could ya?! This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there! Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl! Really?! And thank you, for that. What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you. All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you-I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu! Are you sure? Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh? Do you like it? Okay, I'm working on my flirting. Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left! Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting. You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name? Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens? Gas? Wow! Intense. Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has? They put that in. The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak. A lot of other gas smells. Meth-methane smells. Oh but III haven't paid you yet! Was I talking to her about gas? Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. Yeah? What do you mean? And she just gave you this? Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors. Well that I can believe. And she's supposed to buy this?! Hm-mmm. Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. What? Where? What am I looking at? Me too! Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart! That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy. He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him! Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya? It's the. Chandler! So where are we going next? Yeah, no one talks like that! Hey, I'm more cop than you two! Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner! Umm, jealous! Yeah, no problem. Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home! What is it? What? What? What? What is it? Uh-huh. Thank Joey! Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car. Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me! Yeah, but-but he didn't know that! And it could've just as easily have been a bullet. Wow! I could've died tonight. I do have a newfound respect for life. Rach, what uh, what are you doing here? Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience! Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? And somebody took a shot at me! No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I. I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? II want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. II am seeing everything so-so clearly now. Okay, why are you here? You talked to her? Well, okay, what-what did she say? Wow! Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course! Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily. Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something! You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that II'm supposed to seize! Y'know? Huh. That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but II really don't wanna see or talk to her. Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day. Hey, thanks Rach. Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. Hey Ross, it's you! Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that. Hey umm, was-was Monica here? Yeah, I want my money back. Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real? I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something. I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us. Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island. Also an island. 2:17. Are you serious?! Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch! You bought Shawn Cassidy! What-what is it?! Why is it inside out?! How much did you pay for that? Yeah? How much? ON A CAT?! Free cats do that too, y'know. Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh? Yeah? Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it! What? I know! Don't switch hands, okay? now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?! How do you know? You don't have a watch. Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball! 2 hours, 27 minutes. Hey Rach! Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it! Yeah. Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat. Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? All right. Baking it didn't help, huh? I'm starving! I'm still hungry! I am! Oh, thank God! I know. My arm is killing me. What's going on? Oh God, here we go! Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park. All right, bye! Later! Hey! Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight? I don't know, umm. What's with her? Okay. Action. Dude, you are sick. Hey!

What do you like better flora or fauna? Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle? Why are you mad at me? When did I say you were boring?! Phoebe! You and I have never played chess! Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide? Hey! Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this. What'd you say? Is that supposed to be an insult? So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday. Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes. Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I? Hey. May I come in? Do you want me too? So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of Us. Okay?

Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then. No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot. Uh-hmm. My nana used to do it.

Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it! I’m asking you to do me a favor. And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. Hey! Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents! I don’t know if it’s true. Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage. All right. All right, I’ll do it. Hey! Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of. Oh yeah, why not? Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird? I didn’t get the annulment. We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. Hey! Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of. Oh yeah, why not? Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird? I didn’t get the annulment. We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. Hey, do you have any gum? I know. Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, Three divorces. Three divorces! Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces. Look, all I know is II can’t have another failed marriage! Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please? Hey! Hi! What’s up? Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great. Bye. Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs! No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists. Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times? What?! Why? And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault. What?! This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and II have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here? We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol! Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times. Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, II’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth. Nothing! Yes. Yes, second in two years. Third overall. Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk! Yes-yes-yes! But, II do not love her. This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled. I think just the annulment for today. Easy. No problem. Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy. Oh no. I couldn’t. It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I. I. I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her? I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! Ohh, what’s wrong?! Oh my. Come here! Come here! It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay. Of course. Hey! Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well. No. I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. II just comforted her, as a friend. It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug. It’s also a sign of friendship. It was a hug! S-s-smell her hair? What if I did? I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts! If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place! Hey! Rach, uh, you still looking for a place? Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested? Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here’s Warren’s number. Okay, you go grab it! I don’t know what you’re talking about. Look, I do not re-love her. Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid? You can live with me. What? Uh-huh. Well, I’mI’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out. Hero, I uh, I don’t know well, all right. Oh please! You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya? Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff. What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right? What?! Over a stupid room! Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great! What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly! Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness! Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right? And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya? Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! Hey Rach! You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right? I mean for them. Right? Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird? No! No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place? Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates. Really?! We are? Ohh! That would be great. Yeah, I didn’t think of that. So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?! No, III’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up! Okay, there are no stupid fights! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you! Fine! It’s your life! I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do. DON’T DO IT! So umm, where are the other guys? Fighting?! Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there? Sure! Here. Yeah, I’mI’m sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. I’ve been back and forth. Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys. Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right. Is that what I want? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey! How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen. You complete me kitchen, matey! What? Oh, my, God! II see what this is! You are in love with Rachel! Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel? Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel? When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel? You want her! Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello? No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U! Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it. I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? Professor Geller. Hey everyone! Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind? There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct. subcategories. The first of these subcategories is. No! Why? Ohh! Okay! Okay. There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into. Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club! Okay! Thank you! Please don’t say naked chicks. III don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks. Hello! It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either! I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, Ross you have to be funny and sexy. Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler. That’s right! Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when Oh bloody hell. Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out. Will you-will you please? Oh. I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister. Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing? Just please stop! Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do? They’re not listening too me? Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing? All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis. Were there any questions at this point? Yes. Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? All right, I’mI’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’mI’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression. Well, hello Rachel! Look I was going to tell you! Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage. Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it. Phoebe, I told her you already knew. Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything. Okay Rach, but. Look I told you. Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand! What about the time I said we were on a break? Fine, I’m mentally unstable. What?! Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug! Oh, come on! Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! III’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now! And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies! That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form! And what. What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing! Yeah! My fault?! You threatened the judge! That was the only way I could get him to stop typing! The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce! Did a Porsch throw up on you? I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign. Y’know, II—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay? Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married! Yeah! Right! You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right? What? Okay, can we just sign please? Congratulations. What? Excuse me? Yeah? So then if-if, I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault. I’ve got to say I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you. Did I, did I even treat? That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office. Eh, no problem. Totally. Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! Oh, but-but I can’t do it. Because, because I’ve got Ben. Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? I gotta go make a fake Ben. Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Hello? Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right. Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack. And now you want that money back. Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. No. So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and and live forever as a machine. Hi! So uh, wha-uh, what do you do? Thank you for bringing her into our lives. Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then then I can't date her. Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed. Yeah. Hey! Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin? Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff? Put it back exactly where you found it? ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping. Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica? Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me. Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you. Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there. Yeah that-that, doesn't look right. Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. Hey, I've been married 3 times. Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue. Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ba dum bum chessh. Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science. Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. I'm never gonna find love again. Who cares? I repel women. What?! Why does anyone have to be naked? II had to show Chandler something? Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem. Dude, what'd you have? The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures. So really, what'd ya have? Bye! So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer. That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing. Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary? The one that always stares at me when I come in? Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don’t you set us up? Maybe it’s a universal thing? Hey guys. What’s up? I whitened them. Yeah. What do you think. Come on, seriously. Ahh, II did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to. AA day. I know. That’s why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad? Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything.ahh. I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour. Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore. But, won’t she notice I have makeup on? What? No. I am not putting on makeup. MmmHmm. Mmm. MmHmm. HmmHmm. MmmUnmm. HmmHmmHmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. II came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm. Mmm. HmmHmmHmm. Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm. HmmHmm. MmmHmm. How about all the way. Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we? Ohh, you can see them, huh? II, did that for you. What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999! Yes, of course they like you! Yeah, they don’t like you. I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh. No I don’t want to play video games, Joey! For real? Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that. And the place looks so nice! Happy Thanksgiving! See ya! Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having. Some would say she’s attractive, yes. Dude, we were good! Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner. Yeah, yeah, what is it? WWhat was the one right before bananas? Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way! Oh my God, the pages are stuck together! Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a. Sheperd’s Pie! No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up. Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story! Dude, I need to talk to you a sec. Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you. Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. II didn’t think it would matter. How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister? I don’t know, II was all high. Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was? Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it? Okay, fine! Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay. What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not. TruthDay! Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way no one makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potato Pie! Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second? So um. Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm? And um. You look nice today. What? Eh? You’re alone. Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying! Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left. It tastes like feet! Are you kidding? Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter. Wha-what? You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana? Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry. Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did! Monica and Chandler are living together! II uh, I got tricked into all those things! Hey. Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or? and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago. I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS! Hi Janine! You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most! Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that. Are you serious? Bye Janine! It was a dry day. Oh my God! Got it! Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it! Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air? Right. No biggie. Stay loose. Why do they keep doing that? Right. Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there? Yeah! We know! Okay. Monica! Would it? Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform! The routine! Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform! We got honourable mention in the brother sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice? So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next? Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment! No! Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe going into the robot, y’know? I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then. Hey! You kissed her. Hey! You like it? It’s my new apothecary table! Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn. Why did you do that? She hates Pottery Barn?! What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe. Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn! Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird. Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin! Hey! Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new, old sheet? My apothecary table! I got it at Pottery Barn! Okay?! Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way. Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here. A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large! Fascinating. Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? Really?! Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff. She does want to. Hey! Y’know what would cheer you up? I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come. Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it! Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures. Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too. What? Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did. Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’ What? Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right? No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you. It’s my joke. You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard. What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey. Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a cheque for one hundred ah-dollars. Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer. Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? Well, I’m not going to go now anyway. Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out. Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man. Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee? Seriously, II asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it. Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee? It’s my joke. Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this. Yeah! Hey Mon. Monica! Yeah. Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world. We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth. me. See, I would never snap at you like that. Are you kidding? Okay, look. II studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey! It’s your joke. No way. Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free? Hey does anyone have any gum? Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good! Hey! When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine. Hi Jill. Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card. I don’t think charging new clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own. Sorry-sorry Jill. Huh? Oh, I got this, this! Yeah! Oh, II love these babies! Ross, wants a Pashmina? It’s a rug. Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. Well. Hey! Oh yeah, how about you and the, I’m sorry! Oh stop. No, you stop! Rach? Hi! Did you tell your sister to ask me out? Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, III think she’s cute but II would never have thought of going out with her, never! Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, Why not?! I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just, y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing. Hi Jill! Hi. Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here. Okay. So well I’ll umm, I’ll have her home by midnight. Hey! Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun. I guess so. No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils. Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe. Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again? Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean. Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again. I mean after tomorrow night. Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’llI’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore. You want me to call her right now? Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester! Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she? And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. Yeah! Good for you Joe! You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to. Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me. Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter? Of course, what happened? Okay, umm. What? Wow! Really?! Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes! Ohh! Slides are almost ready. Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen. Hello? O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking. So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show! Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me. You uh, you may have been right about Jill. Umm, she kissed me. Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay? Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess II just wasn’t thinking. Oh wait, hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing. Look II realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us! No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector. You’re welcome. You take care Jill. I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced. The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian. I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical. No, I just think Monica was that fat. What?! Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out? Oh my God! Rachel Green? No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross! No, no-no, Ross Geller. Yeah. Right. Good-good, I’mI’m married. Is-isn’t it the best? Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi. Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited! Come on! No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t. Okay. Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let’s go see Monica! Hey Mon! Mon, look who I ran into! And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. And that’s Phoebe over there! 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual. Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I’ll play you one of my other. Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime! Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks. Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay. Yeah. Well, last weekend. will be two months. since I stopped trying. What-what do you mean? Oh. Wow! Okay, I think I got it. So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there. Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little. Carol our sex life is it’s just not working. Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay! Yay! Seriously, our sex life. I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun? Well I don’t know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome. Come on. I got it. I got it! Hello? No she can’t come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better. Yeah, she’s fired. So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find. Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone’s been doing their homework. Oh, I know. Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda. Yeah? Well, II think Ben’s asleep. Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. Hey, Pheebs! Hey, how’s it going? She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she? Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job. We’re really gonna do this, huh? Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at. Okay. I’mI’m Ross by the way. How hot is this?! Hey! Look at you! You’re up! Hey Joe did. Did you ever have a threesome? No! The reason I’m asking is that. I sorta had one last night. Yeah! Yeah! It was, it was okay. Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here? Oh-oh, absolutely! It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around. Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol. No, she kept kicking me away! No! Oh I a lot of stuff! A little. Yeah. I made a snack. Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard. It really was! Hey Rachel. Umm, no. That-that’s always good news. Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. We’re sorry. Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s? Look II don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that. Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym! Men. I guy I know. She is not. She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this. I’m sorry your husband cheated on you. Try telling my wife that. Hey, remember when I had a monkey? Yeah, what, what was I thinking? What’s up with the greed Joe? Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here? Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job! Hi! Hey, what have you guys been up to? Wow! After one class? I don’t think so. Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call unagi. No, it’s a concept! All right, maybe it means that too. Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care! Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you! All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a surprise! All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. Y’know what. No. So what are you gonna do? DANGER! DANGER! A lesson in the importance of unagi. Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass? I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I, look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER! Ahhh, huh? Unagi. Chandler. I sensed it was you. Unagi. I’m always aware. What’s up? Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes. Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade. Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. Why not? Oh. It’s not something you are! It’s something you have! Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt! It’s a great class. Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next? No. No-no. No. What would you do next? Yes that’s right. I tired attacking two women, did not work. No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, III was married to one of them. Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no. Ah-ha, nowhere to run! DANGER! Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department! Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous. Yeah. It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou, it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student. No, but it is frowned upon. Besides, there’s a big age difference. I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference. Yeah? Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow! That was you? Oh I, I don’tI don’t think that would be the best idea. What time? Gotcha. Oh! So-so seriously, what time? What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson. Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so II kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt. Umm, no. No. Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty. Listen, I gotta tell ya, II’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all. Burt! We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people! Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou. Yeah. What-what should I do? Going out with who? Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh. What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink? Oh, you have some studying to do? Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to. Nothing, I’mI’m just, I’m so comfortable with you! What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone? What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth. That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore. What? Really? Its not just frowned upon? Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other. I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden. What? Really? Well III don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong. No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo. Let’s also get a hot plate! Hey everybody! Hey uh, this is Elizabeth. Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. Bye. Oh that is quite all right ma’am. Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow. Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on! I don’t know Rachel, why? Well thanks! Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now. Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are. Hmm? Oh, a student I don’t know. Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding? Shh! Of course, why don’t we go inside? Oh-ooh! Doorknob! Doorknob! Oh, okay. What-what about? Spring vacation. Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger I’ll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her? I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset? What the hell are you doing? What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?! Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while. Do not give him any money! Yes. Yes! Please, come in. Oo-oo! Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation. Look, I. Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon. No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was. That! Let’s talk about that. Hey! Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation. What’s-what’s the difference? Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that. I went to Egypt with my dad. Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, Spring break! All right? I mean she’s taken my class! I’m gonna call her. Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know. Okay, she can’t go. Then what am I supposed to do? Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys? I’m so glad you’re going on this trip! Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey II know another great way to blow off steam. Are you into crafts at all? Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what’s this? To wear in front of people? Is this?! So uh, have a great time down there. Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit? It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, II am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure. Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk. Really? Okay. Cool. Call me! Excuse me? You're right, you're right, it is. So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? It’s your turn. Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well? Totally! Great! Wow! Oh, I love that guy! What am I doing? Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine. Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. Oh my God! You ate my sandwich? Oh-oh really? What? You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! MY SANDWICH?! MY SANDWICH! What? What? Yes, yes it is. In prison! It took two people to break up this relationship! I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter! I fell asleep! It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, YOU-apostropheRE means ‘you are,’ YOUR means ‘your!’ FINE BY ME! That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, when you’re dead! There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac. Oh my God. I mean. Totally. Hey! What are you guys doing later? I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me. Come on guys, II really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good. Thanks! It-it’s great to meet you Paul. Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens. Eh-wh. Excuse me? That’s funny. Umm. It’s not funny. Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind. What? This is you. Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student. I mean I not not it! I mean, I mean I don’t. We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke. lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish. And the Irish guy wins the joke! Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler. Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees. Yeah, why don’t you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about. Joey?! Joey?! Joey! Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here! Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you! What-what-what the how da-how did-what the-how did-what?! In your mouth?! You were at the coffeehouse! He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird! That was different! This is weird for me! How is that important? Yeah, take your time. Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as. Not all bad. Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean I do that too. No! No! Not. I don’t mean II see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean II have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby. Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! Oh, I’m sorry! It’s unbelievable! You’re back. Y’know what? III. II have had enough of this! Y’know, III care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly. God no! Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! Still not yelling! That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either. Uh yeah, I guess. Yeah! I guess so. Ohhh! Kids! That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now. Hey! Thanks? But I have plans Elizabeth and I are going out of town. Yeah. Why? What? No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh? Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. Oh, come on you guys that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need, he’s got like a hearing aid y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and. Really? That okay, that’s great. All right look, II realize it upsets you. But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it. Ohh! A man with a plan! This place is really beautiful! Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes. Do-do ou want to make out? Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father. No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before. Yeah. Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot. Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it. No. A little bit. Okay. Ohh, okay. What are you doing here?! Yeah, I recognize the ankles! You and your ice. Did you really hear a bear? Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I’m gonna go out this window. I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay? And that is why we cannot see each other anymore. Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain. All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. And I too am just a love machine. Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go. How rude. Hi! Great to see you! How you doing? Okay! You take care! Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before? Phoebe, why’d you do it? What?! Why?! I can’t think of anything. Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago? I guess it could. Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. II wish he would just tell me the truth. Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday? Remember? You-you were eating pizza. Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago. Yeah! Anyway, II still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him. Oh. All the time? Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets? What?! I can’t believe it. Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now. Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all! That’s right! Eh? We’ll show him! Wait a minute, is this, is this for real? So you two are really serious?! You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean. We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! Hey-hey Pheebs! Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him! You told her before you told us? God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever! Yeah, you didn’t get one. Hey! Hey! Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth. I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp to be a counselor! I don’t know. Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way? Uh-uh. Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you! Yeah, yeah you have the ring? Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here! What’s-what’s going on? Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building! Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same. No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second? Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh. Everybody put their balloons down! Now this is a nice suit! Oh my God, you guys! Who? What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too. Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight. Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do. Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’mI’m 12 years older than she is. Hmm. Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and. No! No! I, didn’t do that. It’s just. Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her. I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part. Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake? Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about. What?! Okay, break-up’s still on! What happened you guys? Rach! Hey, come on in. Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be. I guess so. Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup. Ohh, yeah I already have one. Phoebe. Ohh, I don’t think so. That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that. Hey! Phoebe, how could you do this to me?! I was not! No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid! Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too! All right. Hey, what’s going on? I found a note on my door, Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar. What’s up? Oh my God. Congratulations. Where is she? Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, I’m gay! I’m gay! Can I bring her in? Hey! Wow! Happy Monica’s night! Thanks. Well sure. But I get married all the time so. You okay? You mean, we you and me? Oh good, you scared me for a minute. I mean no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times. Surely you can think of something good. What? Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh? My hands? Yeah? Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too. A what? One night, just-just sex. No strings attached? No. Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’mI’m sure it would be amazing but I gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really don’t. Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw. It is! It is! Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together! Yeah! It was just a kiss. Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter! Oh no! And people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not! Guess who? Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air. Still thinking about it huh? Oh, who cares? And so do I. Okay. Sure. No! Hey, here’s a thought. Got me. Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off. Look uh, if we’re gonna do this. Oh, I see, so everybody wins. Oww! Well, I’m going to take off. Congratulations man. And uh, Rachel. What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys is me. Hi! Oh, I’ll have some! Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name. Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade! And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at. Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here? Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you. Wh-what’s going on? Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler? Phoebe, you said it was urgent! Do you realize I have a classroom full of students? Uh, Phoebe. Phoebe, what are you doing? Phoebe! Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment! And they knew about it? Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want! The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle. beer! Cold beer. Hello. Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night. Can I, can I help you with something? Yes I am. Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. Ohh, that’s soft. Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about? Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh? Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! ‘Sup? Excuse me ladies. I’m sorry? I gave him an extremely professional massage! Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop. Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment. He said he liked that! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry. His daughter was hot. About what? Well, you-you’ve always had glasses. Are you sure? Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight? No, why? My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us. Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you. No, II thought it would be more fun this way. Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too. Yeah. You’re not a lefty? Oh, we have to get you an engagement present? No one got me an engagement present. Two! I’ve been engaged twice! Hey. Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand. And what did he ask you not to call him? Over here. ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room. Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part? Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp. Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire? You were trying to eat it! Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed? Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present? Thank you! Hey. Yeeep. Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all. You have to respect the sea! Let’s give it a shot. Ohh, these are pretty good. Which one was that? Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I’m okay. Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh. It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! Looking up? Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister? That’s the day you’re gonna die? See darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day. Ohhhh. It wasn’t the best. Well, the lighting was okay. Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa! Hey! Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner. Hey. Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner? What you got over there? Tacos? Uhh, those are tacos. Eh, either way I’ll pass. I still can’t eat those. What’s so funny?! You told her! Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like. It’s not like I said, Umm, what would make this ride more fun?! How could you tell her?! Oh really? Well II guess Monica should know about Atlantic City. Well, Chandler and I are in a bar. And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls. Oh Mon, I laughed so hard. Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won! Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too! Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made. Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13! Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm! Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me! And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else. Okay, if you’ll excuse me, II’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story. Man! Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh. Amazing! Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees. It’s not a club. Hey, divorced men are not bad men! Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired. Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club. I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back. I like this one. It seems to say, I love you and that’s why I have to kill you. Yeah? What?! No! Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. All right! I want my key back! It’s right there! Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs. Oh yeah. No. You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later. Hi Whitney. Yep. Okay. Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night. Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay? Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people! Like what? Okay. Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons. Yeah! Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me. Hi. Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay and F. Y. I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass. Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable! I think he can be. Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life! I knew you were gonna throw that in my face! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?! So do we! So do we! I’m sorry you had to see that. My God! Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was! Wh-what’s up? Oh just say it Kyle! Y’know, he hums when he pees! It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever. That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already. I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little. Yeah, were better off without them. Divorced men’s club. Joey, we just saw it! And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah! Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay? Well, John McClane had plans! What happened?! We fell asleep! That is all. I think that would be best. Okay. But not about this! No touch! No touch! Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. Just uh, brought back your videos. No! No we don’t! I. I don’t know what you are talking about. I’ve had better. All right! All right! It was the best nap ever! I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey! We can’t do it again. Because it’s weird! Sure, what do you got? No, 10 is the highest. Because it’s the highest. Okay, Rachel you’re up first. Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! Yes, very nice Rachel. When Monica was a little girl, I remember that. Ooh! Ow! Very good! It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech. Go! Yeah, it really was! Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next although I really don’t see the point. I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close. Actually, it wasn’t that close. Yeah? Why-why would I care about that? It really was. Excuse me. Okay, okay take a guess. Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that? People are doing it in front of my book! My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section! Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around. Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing! Oh for cryin’ out loud! Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437? No! No! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See II wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it. Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! And don’t you follow me! Yes? Yes?! How can I help you? Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus? Ah. Ah. Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution? I find Marion’s views far to progressionist. I’m a professor here uh, Ross. Geller. Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?! Well I uh, I skipped forth grade. I am very very sorry. Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby to shine in people’s eye. Okay, see you later. Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? What? That's like insanely easy! What? You forgot fourteen states? Wow, how many have you got? Done! With time a-to-spare. You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called a globe? Hmm? What? That's impossible. No, just give me another minute. This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. You're on! Pshhshhh! Phoebe, why is your bag moving? Ohio! Thank you! What dog? There-there's no dog here. Are you out of your mind? Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand! It's too cold. It hurts my teeth. How can I not get this? I'm a college professor I got 1450 on my S. A. T.s. Damn, I forgot you were here. Hey! What's she doing back here? Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically. Yeah, but, but look what I'm. Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. Because you sent away the dog! Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend. Phyllis. take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. From you? Yes, please! I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! II think, I should be able to eat something. Tag? YYou're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? Ah, what good are you. Delaware! Delaware! I want my turkey now! I know. You sure? No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah. What?! Ohh. That is so unfair! Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second. Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike II couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so. You like it? Yeah? Ahh. Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride. You’re welcome. Phoebe really likes the bike huh? Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times? Pheebs you uh you do know how to ride a bike don’t you? Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready. Set. Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike! Well. In-in case of emergency. Well let there what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, You ride this bike or I’ll sh. I’ll shoot you. Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and. Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay? No! I swear! Come on. All right, here we go. All right? All right. Feel good? All right, try pedaling. That’s it, your doing great. Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes! Yes! Yes! II just thought you were doing so well. I. It’s a legitimate learning technique. Wow! Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy. Need some help? By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. Look, II’m really sorry I let go of the bike. I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe! Phoebe. All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back. Because! Because, it-it-it’s. It’d be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! The bike is dying. Great! Great! You’re making the bike very happy. Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them. Hey! Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year. Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah. Hmm. Woooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya? Well, I do, so let's. So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya? Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up? Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees. Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay. Okay, it's not a contest. Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah? No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben. No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy! Yes! Santa's coming! Hey! No, these are my pants. Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left? Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I uh, you gotta have something. I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas! Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas. That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents. You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah! You are? Me, too! You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights? Yeah! Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees. What are you doing here, Santa? I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your partJewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? What are you doing? Thank you, but, but you gotta leave. Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it. I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me. Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye! Fine, II give up. Santa, Santa can stay. All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees. and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for. That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end. Yeah? The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles! Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today? Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what? Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night. No. Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail. Y’know, she tried to undress me too. Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The RossATron! Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule. Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the RossATron? Hey. So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall. Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest. Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed! Not broad backed! What? I can’t cancel on Joan! Bec. Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway? Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah. Stop saying, Blood to strangers. Oh, hey Aunt Millie. Yes, yes it is. It’s uh. Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?! Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her. That bitch! Hi Frannie, congratulations. So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done. What? Oh, okay. Wait here. Well. Why?! Why on the lips?! Well, technically it seven billion years ago. Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who’s official name is BapsteinKing. Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it? Huh? What? What? Is it the comet? Joey come. I can’t believe. I bring you here to see the BapsteinKing comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman! Show me where? Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open? Joey! It’s called the BapsteinKing comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer! Rachel! Monica! I can’t believe this! Yeah, I guess we don’t have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down! I know, I wasn’t finished. But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape! Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in. Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t. Well, I’m not gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility. Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is? Okay. Well, you be careful. Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die! Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later. I don’t think so. Hello? When you get in there. Okay, do-do you have a good grip? Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now. Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face. I would say that. Okay, here I go. I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight. So what do you want me to do? Hi. M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me. It’s still looks pretty far! Do not rush me! Oww! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I. Ooh, a quarter! Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, This is my brother-in-law Ross. Not, My friend Ross, brother-in-law Ross. That’s weird isn’t it? Sure, do whatever you want. Yeah? Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is. Oh my God! I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us! Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we’re surprised! Who did you leave a message with? I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room. They kept your room for a while. Come on, you know they love you. I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault. Hey. What’s wrong with this year? Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing. What? Dad? Hey! Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house. Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater. Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these? Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym. Oooh, my rock polisher! It’s a clown kit! Clown kit! What? How are you ever going to sell this place? Oh no. Dad! Dad! What. Oh God everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed! No! Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her. Well, can you blame her? Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it. Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab, grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in there. Like uh y’know like this! This! She she could’ve made this! Right? And this! She-she could’ve won this! Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this? Hey. Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory. Well, these. These are yours right here. Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book. Nu-uh! Oh, I don’t know how that got in there. Umm, your boxes are umm. Dad? All right. I think it was a mouse.

Because you just turned——twenty-eight! You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk. I really wish that you wouldn’t. Come on! Okay, is everybody clear?

God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40? Yes! My baby’s finally free! Woohoo! You wanna buy a car? What’s the matter? You okay? Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too. Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys. Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q. T. What? A brain transplant?! It’s ridiculous! It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the brain transplant, you are going to be her? What?! Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots. Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more. How did you know about that?! Were you the ones called the cops?! Why not? Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play! No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a wee bit o’ celebration. now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt. Do you wanna start telling secrets? Now umm, remember I’m still learning. One, two, three, four! You know the song! Sing along! So? You know the song! Sing along! Hi. Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency. Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there? Okay! All clear! Everything okay in there? Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour? Oh, she isn’t home. Well, Ben would be there. What’s the matter? Rach, he’s not an ex-con. I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive. Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay? I wasn’t talking to you. Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour. I have a bone to pick with you. Yes! Ben learned a little trick. That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere! Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them! I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right? Rachel! What are you doing here? Your good friend? What’s her last name? Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face? Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, Dude, don’t you ever wash your face? Of course I was mad! I told you II hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny! Hi. Practical jokes. You have a line down your face. Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt! I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay? No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I… Hey! Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? II’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so… Okay, I’ll see you later pal. What? What? That’s great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?! All right, that’s it! Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man! Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding! II-am— Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her? Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you. I got it. So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime. Ah. Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight? Yeah? Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God! Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again. Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… Hey. Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy. Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose! Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her. Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her… That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her… Okay, okay. This can go on for a while. No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best. Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street… Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates. So let’s decide on the spending limit… I was thinking more like a hundred. Hey! What’s up? Oh thanks! We have 8:00 reservations at Gramercy Bistro. I am dressed. I have an oily T-zone! That’s right. Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though. Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? Why am I not surprised? I don’t think you have much choice. Bye-bye! Yes. Yes. Just here and there. So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. Yeah. Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasm out of control. Hi. It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore. Yeah. So… So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something? That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman? Much better. Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son. That’s right! Wait no, Ben. Well umm… Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food? Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea? Hey you leave Marcel out of this! Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?! Probably around gonorrhea. Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin! …and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. Yes Mr. Lewis? Just a high pitched intimidating noise. Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid II had to fail you. Well you need 60 to pass… Seven. No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned? Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem. Well that brings me in the loop a little. Okay! Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs. Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you? There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me. I doI do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me. Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm. Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack. Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you? And why exactly would I do that? What?! No! Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me! What? I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade. Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment? Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back. ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work. Y’know what? II’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay——Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel, Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. Shall we? A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America. Cassie? Wow, I haven’t seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes. So what! I still have—No you’re probably right. What—why? What?! Chandler, she’s our cousin! Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now. Cassie?! Hey! Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn’t. It’s okay. Come, come on in. Oh. Uh-huh. Yeah, II have a knack for impressions. Yeah—No! Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog. Thank God. Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? We’re probably too old to do that now. Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related. Well I’m, I’m a little slow. Just as our children would be. She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in. Say something clever! Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse! So just say something! II, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything. She seems really, really fun! What?! So that’s two of my wives. Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux! That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in. So? Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love. Pretty please? Not very uh, 007. When I got married you slept with my sister. Hey! Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together. Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together. What, are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux! Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there. What? Let me see that! Oh man! Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise. Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you. everyone, this is Chandler! I’m getting married today! Ahh, whoo-hoo! Hey! Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions. How’s Monica coming along with her vows? I can’t believe that in four weeks they’re gonnta be married! Phoebe that’s not true. Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long. What's going on? What?! What?! Actually, it looks really good. No! No! Wh… What are you doing?! GET OFF MY SISTER! It’ll be okay Joe. That little naked guy would be me. Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now? Got me. Looks like a fun gang. No-no, that would be me again. Oh man, this is hilarious. Dude! Dude! How-how did you write this? You can’t do that! Hey! Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin. It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship! Hey! Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block. Whew! That was a brisk ride! Only way to fly. You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver. Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy. What?! Give-give me a brush. No way! Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. What do you think you’re doing?! There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys? No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! With you?! Yeah right! Okay! Okay! Okay! In the death seat?! You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now! What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around! Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble. I was talking to myself! You’re going down! Yeah, I’ll get right on that. No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this. Oh my God. Dear Lord! Here it comes. Well she should, it was taken ten years ago! I can handle the stick! Who? What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything! Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! Good evening officer. Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty. I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya? Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night… You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty? I know. I know. Oh, where are you guys going? Ah. Joey, youre-youre having lunch with my mom? Yknow what? Actually Im kinda glad theyre leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something. Well this uh, this may be a little awkward. No, itsIts not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you, Im not saying as your friend. Okay? ImIm saying as it as Monicas older brother. Not for the next few minutes. Nope. Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother II have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down and kick your ass! What? ImImIm serious! ComeHey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? ImIm not kidding here! No problem. Yeah. Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler. Well II told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! Thanks you guys. Can I have everyones attention please? Im uh Im Ross Geller. Daddad, please! As I was saying umm, Im Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and Im the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, shes the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if youd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple were here to celebrate. To the Bings. Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel. What? Are you going back to work? Nice shades. And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I! Hey, wheres Chandler? Chandler? Chandler? Hey! Is uh, is Monica here? I think Chandlers gone. He left that. I think it means he freaked out and left! LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay? I will, I will find him. Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler? Oh damn! Yes. Yes. Dont worry. Everythings fine. Well uh, well see you tomorrow at the wedding. Well then, well-well see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-whatwhat you guys doing here?! Why?! Gunther?! What? Your-your list? Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know Im looking for him? No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. III talked to Chandlers parents again! No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them. No! Hey! Hey! We cant! Well, cant you at least stall her a little? IllIll go back to some of the places I went last night. Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready? Give me two. Okay, wish me luck. Why?! We are never gonna find him! Hes one guy in a huge city! That is an old, Chinese woman! Aw, yknowYknow, maybe were-were just approaching this all wrong. If youre Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think youd go? So this is your office? Shes fine. She doesnt know youre gone. And she doesnt have to know, okay? Now come on, were going home. Whats wrong with being the Bings? Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room? Then you are neither of your parents! Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower? YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right? There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasnt so scary, was it? Im telling you, just a little bit at a time. Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like youve done everything else! Yeah. WhHeyWhoa-whoa, where, where you going?! Okay. Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler? He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek. Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad. Oh my God! Monica! Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler. Uh-huh. These-these are beads of joy. Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second? Chandlers gone again! There he is! Youre not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about! HiiiiYa! Im serious! Youre not walking out on my sister! Then where the hell have you been?! What? What?! What?! Talking about what?! Know whatIf somebody doesnt tell me whats going on right now. Oh my God. Oh my God! And youre-youreyoure not freaking out? Dude. Huh. This is nice. Ive never walked down the aisle knowing it cant end in divorce. Rings? Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you! Monica’s pregnant! What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant? No! I’ll be right back. Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother. Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name. Aw come on, Mona Lisa? Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world. Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too. Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken. Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six. Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… Hello. It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… Hi. Umm, would you like to dance? Yeah? Oh great! I wasn’t farting! Uh, a little game from our table. Yes? Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady. Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first. Yes II am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet. Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking? Keep dancing. No-no, thank you Miranda. All right. Oh-oh, were you, were you watching? What? Of course you can! Hop on! I am so gonna score. I like your bow. That was very nice Ashley. No-no. Oh! Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name. That’s, that’s pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert? Okay. Hop on Gert. I’m trying. Maybe I should stand on your feet! I just didn’t see the fast song coming. Oh, thank you. Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! Hi. Why not? It’s built into the price of the room. Thread! What disposable cameras? No you didn’t. Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian? Yeah, then you did that. No. Sorry man. Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’llI’ll help you look for them. In-in three minutes. Chandler? No. Did you? Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them. Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed? I’m sorry man. Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people. No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces. I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down? I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers? What about the chairs? How about the place settings? What did you do? Hmm. I heard it. I heard it. Okay. Okay! Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed. A ’95 LeSabre?! A green LeSabre? I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre. Well go! Go move it! Yeah. Now you are going to love these. Huh, didn’t see that coming. Well, I’m gonna go get these in some water. No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month! Hey! How you doing? Yeah. Oh hey, right back at ya. Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady? Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later. He is so weird. Hey! No why? Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later. Oh no. I think I might know what this is about. Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together. Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked. Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again. Why? What-what else could it be? I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you? Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. Hi. I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? Look uh, I know why you’re here. Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first. Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it? I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends? Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’dI’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now. Oh sure. I’m good. I’m good. Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom. What? What? What?! Well they should put that on the box! No they don’t! Well they should put it in huge black letters! Oh well I may as well have! Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer! No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company! Shh! Shh! Shh! Yeah I’ll press 1! Hi. Sure. Namaste. Oh my God! What happened to the door?! Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her. Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. Rachel’s pregnant. With my child. You already know don’t you? Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well. Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone. But hey, in my defense II just found out condoms are like only 97 effective. I gotta go find her. Evidently they do. Hi! Uh we-we need to talk. Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today. What? Oh yeah. I’m sorry. I mean II think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really—I should have been thinking about you Rach… Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married. Well yeah, I think we should get married. No, because that’s the right thing to do. No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone. Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant. I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself? When have you ever? Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup! I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat! But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone. I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me. Oh my God. Thank you. Pretty amazing huh? What? What?! You-you just said that you did! Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there. Do you really? Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut? Sweetie that’s it. You’re welcome. Yeah, that’s our baby. Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus. Oh. He takes the picture and hugs her. Hello! So, how was the honeymoon? Yeah, thanks. Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading. The lie you just told. There’s the one! Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who. What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place! Yeah! Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened! Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it. I can show you, I have it on videotape! It’s an expression. Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door! Okay, listen I am not a pervert! Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. About…about sex? That I hadn’t had sex in months? Hey! Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about. I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise. Five to be lying, six. Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky. Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health! Really? Well then tell it to me. I’ll try to control myself. You were backpacking across Western Europe? Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and? Why? It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking… Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo… Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?! Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks! No! No, I don’t…don’t want to. I was backpacking across Western Europe. I was just outside Barcelona, hiking… It’s been six months! I’m always hot! I’ll try that. Thanks. Thanks. And-and hey Joe? Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out. Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel! Hi! That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was. So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything. What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me! Thank you. No! Joey! No! Look, it was accident! Okay? II feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. Forget it, she’s destroying it. Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story. What?! I don’t want people to see it for your sake. Rachel, please… Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying… Hello! Can I get you anything? You didn’t do it? Not on the ones we sent out. I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost… I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to. So we…we both wanted to. Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best. And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why. Now I’m so happy. Hi. Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it III know I would’ve. It was. It was an amazing night. I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it. Uhhh…that-that may be weird. Good luck. Mind if I mute? Oh, oh there go the clothes. Six months Rachel, six months. Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good. Oh nice tan! Ah…. I have been working out. Oh that’s not pretty. No! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long. Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go. Yeah! Yeah! I’m telling you, I like the food! Did that guy just call you Toby? Well, why don’t you correct him? Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him! Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel! Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they? Hey! So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested? Rach? You wanna come? A date? Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull. A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who? You set her up?! Joey what-what were you thinking?! Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them? A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?! Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew! Hi. II hear you’re going on a ferry tonight. A bit of a daredevil are we? Okay. Have a great time you guys. Yes it is too slutty! Books? Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang. Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no. I just…I have to find out how it went. This guy could be my baby’s stepfather! I just—II can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?! I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening. It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now II love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section. No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away. It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though. No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were? No, it’s not what I want either. I mean II can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now. Yeah. We can still catch that Ukrainian film. Hello. Well, how was the date? Uh-huh. What happened? Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well? Oh? He sounds swell. Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up? Sit down. Guess whose middle name is Muriel. Yeah-ha! I’m sorry about your date. Yeah I know.

Well I dont know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission. Yeah. Yeah. No. No youre right. Yeah. Hi. Im Ross Geller. I live in the building. II heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and Im so sorry for your loss. What? Oh, thank God! Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room. Yknow I would its just painful. Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. Yeah, were done. Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? Really?! Sweet! Okay II just have to stop by my place first. No-no, II have to see if this apartment became available. Its not for me, its for Rachel. Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move. Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you? Ezel! Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel! Damnit! Hi. How is she? Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. Oh I dont know that it would. All right then. Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I dont care, because you got the apartment. Yes! Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little. Yeah, a lot of my students do that. Okay, IIll see you tonight. Okay, bye. Ah, its good. Its going good. I mean, we get along great. Shes, shes so. Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh! Well II havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow? Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight. Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta. So much more. Aw forget it, its from Pier One. Sorry. Yknow this is actually not a great time for me. Who did?! Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing. No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I careII love Rachel. Oh but not that way. I meanI mean Im not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend. Hey! I offered to marry her! But I didnt want to. Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green. I was going to tell you, but. Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just Why dont we just let the machine get that? No! No! No! No! No! IIIII need to, I need to lie down. So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man! I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out! Rachel! Okay! Thank you! Thank you so much for coming back over. Focus. Yeah. Trying to date this woman. Probably shouldnt touch me. Should I leave this open for you too? Because whats going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you. I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachels father. Look II made a mistake, but its only because I really, really like you. Really! Will! Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff? Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to? Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting. Oh! Man I dont think Ive seen you since uh, Lance Davis graduation party. Yeah. It wouldve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun. Yeah. Yeah. So how long are you in town? Awoh, thats right. Are-are you gonna be okay? Will, high school was-was a long time ago. No need to point, she knows who Ross is. No. No. Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but II dont think he-he knew what it was. That was in high school! Its not like it was binding forever. Look Rach IIm sorry, okay? II was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined. co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didnt handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club. No-no! No-no. No-no. It was no big deal. We-wesaid that the rumor wasthat ummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts. Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that ones not really our fault. Rach, I think youre reading a little too much into it. Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true?! Well look-look Im not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago! What? How did you know that?! No. Hey! She didnt look 50! She didnt photograph well! I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace. Only when it was damp! I cant believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Yknow what? Im back in the club! As a romancer of the elderly. The eyesdid still sparkle. Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together. Yeah. Nope. Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time. Bye. Yeah. Why? Yeah I know hes in Bens class. Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools? Uh, I actually havent even met him. Well actually, Im picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe hell be there. Hey! Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school. I dropped him off at Carols. Anyway, it turns out that Im not going to be able to get those tickets though. Well it turns out that Ben and Stings son do not get along. Apparently, Stings son made fun of the fact that Bens moms are lesbinims. Phoebe, you cant force kids to be friends. Playpen?! Bens seven! Look Im sorry Pheebs, I cant do it. What? Look Phoebe, Im sorry its just. Phoebe, I. Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets! Welllets just say Rosss caaaaan! Uh, middle balcony. Yeah. Hi! Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating? Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together? Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow. Together? Like-like to people? Okay. Uh sure, sure. I know. Can you believe that? Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?! Hey! Huh. Wow, this is great. Well, we-we havent said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people. A hundred?! Well, II guess Ill take aMona, uhIIm not sure about the whole uh, card thing. Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just dont know if were really quite there yet. Yeah. Huh. Hmm. Lets do the card! The card! I think were there! Really?! I mean, even with the card? Hey! Oh yeah, yeah were moving forward. Youll be getting our card! Yeah, were not just doing a card! Yknow, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going. I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, So, where is this going? Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? Im not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. Im horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Yknow, something that says were moving forward without having to talk about it. Smaller than that. Uh, bigger than that. Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape. Yeah II dontI dont think Im quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you. Forget it. IIYknow what? Ill just have the conversation. Ill just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach? Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us. Aw, we-we are so So umm, well III like you and II love umm, yknow hanging out with you. And I meanIm having a lot of fun. I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun. Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! Thats-thats the real question. And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun. Now II know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger. No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou are getting younger. I meanyou-you look like youre getting younger by the secondWhats your secret? Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young. But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment. Really. Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship. Oh great, I live on the street. Okay, and oh Im gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all. No. That guy is. Im trying to tell you I made you a mix tape. I love you! Hey! Oh, Im so glad you guys are here. Ive been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today. Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so. No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didnt I get head of the department? which brings us back, of course, to Greelys theory of dominance. Okay, that-thats all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is? What?! That-thats all the way cross town, Im supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes. Move it! Move it! Move it! Hey! Im the teacher! Hello. Im sorry Im a little late. AhWhoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, Im Professor Geller. Good job today. No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, Get the hell out of my way! Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets itll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller? Well I have to. Okay? If I dont, theyll take the class away from me. AndI already put it in my family newsletter. Youve seen it, the Geller Yeller. Besides, II think I figured out a much faster route, Im sure I can make it this time. I justI just cant be afraid to get a little bithit by cars. Yeah! Yes, I made it! Im on time! Okay, why dont we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots. Okay, umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I Phoebe! So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs. Right. No-no, we talked about it. We dont want to know. All we care about is that its happy and healthy. And smart! With an aptitude for science. Really? Me too! Maybe. But it wouldnt hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, RachRach, what were you thinking? Huh. Thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent. Well, OK, its for a boy. Well, I know its a little out there, butDarwin. Youre just saying that 'cause I said no to your name! All right. That sounds fair. Veto. Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat. Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher? Fine, you go. Huh. Oh, veto. How aboutOoh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth? Veto. Stewart? Veto. Helen? I dont think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that? Uh, no. No, were not. No, no, we want to wait, right? What? Rach! Come on, thats terrible! Theyreuhtheyre babies. Theyre-theyre all beautiful. Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows Im talking about it. Dont-dont youWhWhaHey! Youre looking! I saw you! Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you! No, no, no, no! Dont tell me! I dont want to know! Momentary lapse. Dont-dont you have any self-control? Hey. Rach, II cant tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know were never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know its a boy! I dont think so! Youre just giving me Ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy, and thats when youll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia. Veto. Unless You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, Im not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table! Not like this! So, I uh I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby. Thats right. The student has become the master. Oh, come on, you know its a girl! You really didnt know? No. No. Yes. Im Im sorry. Im so sorry. I know! I know. You know what? Im putting Ruth back on the table! Permission to veto. Hello? Well hey! Whats going on? Ooh, cool boatOh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them? I hope youre a better father than youre a friend! Hey! What?! It is?! Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened? My God, the babys kicking. Thats great. Although Ikinda wish II wouldve been there to feel the kicking for the first time yknow. Look, II dont want to miss anymore baby stuff. SoHere. Heres my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! Ill be there! Okay? I dont care if its three in the morning and all you want is ice cream. Is everything okay? Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened? Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women dont even feel them. Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater. No IMona! What? Why? Whats wrong? No really, you tell me whats up. So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital. Yeah but still, I mean it shouldve been me. Im the dad. Hey uh, I brought you some lunch. Well yeah! What?! What?! Rach what?! I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles. IIm sorry Rach, I didnt know. Are you gonna be okay? I cant believe this! I shouldnt be the one making her throw up! Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I dont know any of it and Im the father. I wish Id be more involved yknow. Yeah. No III would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis. So? Sure! But it-it wouldnt be anything romantic. And ImIm dating MonaDamnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?! No! No its not. Joey, this is a smart idea. Really? Oh Rach thats great. Thats great. Oh, Im actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, shes been away all week visiting her parents, but shell be cool. I mean, shes been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, Fossils are my friends. Uh, Im going to take off. What is it? All right. Candy and Cookie? Hey, whats behind your back? You dont want my opinion? Come on, Im your older brother, ask me! The red one. Hey! So, how was Atlantic City? Yeah? Wha? Oh, come on. You didnt have tosaltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. Thats not interesting. I do too! I missed you! Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking! Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasnt around when it happened for the first time. Yeah, Im missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me. What? Huhuh-huh. Just a second! I dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy! Ever?! Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, Im going to take her to an amazing Valentines dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks Im the best boyfriend in the world, then Im going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me. Well, Im, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight? Yknow, its interesting! Most people think thats made with seawater, when in fact Mona? What arehi! What are you doing here? Im, um, supposed to pick you up! Ayyyayyyy! I have no idea! Uhlately, she just likes hanging out here. I think shes lonely. I know. No, no. Shes way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy. Mm-hmm. Shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy. And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why dont you, uh, open the champagne, and Ill be right back. Ive got a surprise for you. Please start drinking! Happy Valentines Day! Or something to remember me by. Hey, hey, man! UhMona just dumped me. Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know? Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentines Day? Whats going on, huh? Girl trouble? Really?! Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it. Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Yknow, actually onceonce I got dumped during sex. Anyway, so, uh, so what is it? Cmon! Joey! What is it? Hey, hey, its me. Why cant you tell me? Shes not a Tribbiani? I knew it. So, is she someone from work? Well, uh, does she like you? Why not? So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her? Okay. Um is he a good guy? Then talk to him! He might be fine with it. Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her. Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. Im going touhIm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home. Anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy? Then talk to him! He might be fine with it. Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her. Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. Did you umIm sorry, did you just say its Rachel? Um, youyou like Rachel? Rachel?! But RRRachelRachel?! Its not a big deal? Oh, Im sorry I justum, Iwhat about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I likeyou-you cant stop thinking about her. Like how you cant sleep? Rachel whos carrying my baby? Rachel? Yknow what? II gotta go. I justyknowII just have oneRachel?! Hey. Oh yknow, I stillI cant believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean its Its like you and me going out, only weirder! Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then hed be the stepfather of my child. Sure, because women never like Joey. Yknow, I think hes a virgin. Hes not? Why? Hate him? I No, I dont hate him. Its just its Rachel, yknow? Okay. Okay, Ill talk to him. Hey. No, I dont want to hit you. No. No, no I dont want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that Im not mad at you andand that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. Uhyeah sure. Okay. Thank you. What?! Youre in love with her. Umm, no. I think you need to tell her how you feel. No, Im serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if shes not where you are, then you can start to move past this. If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it shouldnt stand in the way. Yeah. Look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldnt find a better guy. So. So when do you think youre gonna talk to her? Im understanding, but lets not get carried away. Yeah, tell me about it. Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? Its a button down, like a, like a faded salmon? Faded salmon color. Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it! Thats my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt! I dont know. I mean II guess I could. Its just that we didnt really end things such good terms. And if I go over there Id be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. Mona? Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? Hello! Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable. Item J437A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. Im so-so sorry about yesterday. IIm really sorry. Its just that I. You do? Oh God youre right. Sure. Yeah. Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th? Okay, hopefully this time mom wont boo you. Hey! Aww that is so cool. Aww! ChiChi! Oh, I loved this dog! Yknow Monica couldnt get braces because ChiChi needed knee surgery. You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her! Ah, actually, Im sorry we-we probably should get going. Well, there is an Arbys in the shape of a tee-pee. So uh, he seems like a nice guy. Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab? Hi! Hey mom. Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question. WhaWhat? Dad so what we have to pretend that were married? Can you believe that? No, us having to lie about being married. Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan. We love marriage! Hey. Im so we werent in the car! Did he ever let up? This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry. That depends, how much did you hear? What was wrong with Mona? Yeah baby! No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding. Would you excuse us for a second? Umm. what are you doing? Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley. Well, um, actually, II took her to the planetarium. Thats-thats where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower. Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words Will you marry me? Oh, no, Mom, its just Monica this year. No, of course, Um Um, everybody? Um, II just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, Rachel, and myself. Umm, that ifif in 35 years, were half as happy as you guys are, well count ourselves the luckiest people in the world. and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar! But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem? Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made. Yeah. I know, I know it was stupid. No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night. Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up? Thats all Im askin Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech. Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of ChiChi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was. Hey! Whyd you say no? Just then or-or all the time, cause we-we have jobs yknow. Shhh! Were not talking. Uh, double latte, extra foam. Come on, it's fun! Are you serious?! Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch! It tastes like feet! Are you kidding? Who just lost the respect of her unborn child. Yeah, so far nothing stupid. Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy. Yeah, you too. All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes. Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you. Ewwww! You peed on yourself?! Your make-up! Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so were face to face or-or should I climb down your back so were-were butt to face. I would say that. Okay, here I go. I prefer not to answer that right now, Im still carrying a little holiday weight. It really was. Hi Jill. Amazing! Amazing! Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy. Did you just wink at me? Oh cool! Well do you want some help? Awesome! Yeah! Well uh, IIm a paleontologist. Umm, II live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh. Im sorry, I dont believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other. The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, Ill take another question. Its okay, Im ready. The fear of Triscuts! Its possible, they have really sharp edges. Wait a minute, II believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn? Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing. What?! You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you. Hungry monkey! Haaa! Id like a Wicked Wango card! Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second! Shut up! I Dream of Genie! Id like to spin the wheel! Is there a hopping bonus? Ben Franklin. Queen Victoria. Noooo! Every time! Yeah! Hey! I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower. Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff. A PlayDough Barber Shop? Uh, what? WhatYoure not serious. I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. Shell drive us totally crazy. Hi roomie! Well wewe dont have a garage. Yknow what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, its not absolutely vital that you live with us. ImIm sure thats not true. Well uh, yknow what? Even if she doesnt know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didnt live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself. Yeah. Thats a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there toto feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things. Yes! Yes, youre gonna be so missed. Well youre gonna be a wonderful grandma. Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. Youllyoure gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, yknow when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddys credit card. Do you remember? Look at you! WhatYoure-youre this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. II have no doubt youre gonna be an incredible mother. Im telling you. Oh. You sure? All right then. Rachel Green! Lets play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the babys bath water? Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap? Thats correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card? Hey you guys I got some bad news. No, Monicas restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didnt want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. Umm. But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know. Yeah, they all know. What?! What? Are ya? What are you doing up? Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after. Its funny you should mention diapers. Okay look, theres nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. Theres a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay? Okay. Okay. If uh, if youre gonna do this, then Im gonna do that. So. Yeah! Well uh. Oh. We are having a baby together, but were not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, wed like this delivered please. Oh, okay. I chose those, Im a paleontologist. Yeah! II teach it in my class. Thats my gym. I am like Indiana Jones. My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here? Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store. Oh. Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didnt happen. Uh yeah, actually Im free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or. Yeah, Im just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Yknow because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because ImIm into S amp M. Im notIm not into anything weird. Yknow? Just-just normal sex. So, Im gonna grab my coat. Hey. How are you? Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee. Whats uh, whats going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie? I liked her. Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?! Why? What was wrong with her? Okay, so whats the matter? Why? What, what are you jealous? Okay. I wont date. Ill uh, Ill be here, with you, all the time. True, but youre allowed to be unreasonable. Youre having our baby. Do you feel better? Uh Rach? Just one thing umm. We live together. Youre having our baby. Im not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you dont want something more? Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin around! Like you did last night when I had to pee? Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you. that you actually. Rach? The bathroom? Hey! What are you guys looking at? Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent! Now I cannot wait to see this. Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here? Look, II know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea. Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctors appointment. Rach, we gotta go. People ask me why were not together, I just dont know what to tell them. Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctors keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry. Really? You dont think thats a little inappropriate. Fine! Fine! Yknow what? Whatever you want. Okay? Youre the mommy. Yeah? Uh-huh. Mmm? Wow! Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, youve been a little short with me lately. Im not trying to irritate you. Yknow what? The doctor will be in soon, why dont we not speak until then. Yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil! Oh, youre nice to her. Do them! Youve got to be kidding me! Hey. Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked. Its sex. Monica! Monica, what is the matter with you? What?! While shes been going through this hell, youve been making money?! Youre betting on your friend staying in this misery?! What?! Can I get some of that action? Come on, finish your enchilada. Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha Oh God! Soso hot! Oh my By the way, you dont want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye. Stop it. Im sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, Im dying. This is insane, Im not gonna make love to you just so that youll go into labor. Always a great way to get in a mans pants. I love when you talk dirty to me. Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen. Yknow what? Forget it. Im getting that baby out of you! Oh, I know. I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys? Hey! Were having a baby. Not so much. All right! Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it! No, but come on, were off to a great start arent we? I knew Id get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record! Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here? N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs! Okay is theresome kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?! Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. Im Ross Geller. We-we called from the car. Yeah? I really think theyre out of rooms. Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up? What-what? Thank you. Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! Never done this before. Hi! Hi, Im uh Ross. Im here to ruin this magical day for you. Hi Julie. This is Rachel. Yeah. Umm say, II opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy. Oh, okay. What? Oh. Okay, just breathe. Were not gonna do that. Uh yes! Thank you. Later. Oh uh, Im sorry. Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. II wished youd called first. Oh good. Okay, whats up? Ma, youre asking me to marry you? Mom no, come on! Thank you. N-no! Okay? Weve been through this! Were not gonna get married just because shes pregnant, okay? Mom, yknow what? II cant deal with this right now. Im sorry. Gimmie! she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why Im not with Rachel. Are you kidding? Look, were not gonna be together just because were having a baby. Okay? Okay, stop it! I cant deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby. Hey. Whos that? What happened to the Disgustingtons? Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people? Yeah? Okay. Umm. Umm, ImIm just gonna No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. Just ignore them. What? What? Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?! The nurse said theyre bringing in another woman. Thats it. Thats it. Just three?! Im dilated three! Actually its more like this. Uh Rach. And yet somehow its true! Squeeze your legs together and cover the babys ears! Really? Oh there you go! No-no. We. Um uhWere-were just having this baby together but uh, uh thats all. Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this. Sid you lucky deaf bastard. Hey! Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything. Yknow what I think it is? I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave. Sweetie youre doing great. What? You do? You do? Oh my God! What is that? Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads. Go! Yes you can! Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Lets go! No! Come on letsOne more time! One final push! Ready? 123! Keep pushing! You have no idea how much this hurts. Keep going! Keep going! Oh! Oh! Shes upside down but shes coming! Shes coming! Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God shes here. Oh shesshes perfect. Oh its okay. Theyre just-theyre just wrapping her up. Oh, come in. The doctor says its completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-youre sleep deprived. Uh actually, we-weve narrowed it down to two names. Wow! Umm, okay uheveryonethisis Isabella. What? Umm, Delilah. So I guess were back to uh, Baby Girl. Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be. Hey Janice! Whos this little guy? No-no. No. Okay. Man! Did you see the kid on that nose? Huh? Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But wewe gotta be careful. Wewe cant let that happen again, yknow? I mean we dont want to go down that road do we? Oh my God! Im sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot. Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her. Look at Emma! Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel. Itsits complicated okay? Look, weve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now. Yeah, exactly. Hey Joey. Hey you. Youre weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something. Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute? What? Hey, wheres uh, wheres mom? Uh Dad, Emmas in the nursery. Ill take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you. What about Ben? Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room. Yeah right. What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys? Dad seriously! Yknow you really should see someone about that! I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit? Actually umm. Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Ill guess justIll come back. Dad, what are you doing? No! Yknow what? I dont like you without mom. Come on. Hi! What, that we had a baby? Come on lets give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier. What? Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnt propose. I am a doctor! Yknow what? Im just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself. No! No, come on let her sleep! Shes so exhausted. What? Oh my God! She-she thinks were engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think were engaged?! I didnt give her that ring! No! Its mine. Yes! No! No! Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again. Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people? Well I didnt! I didnt propose! Unless uh Did I? I havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something I would do. Hey. Listen, I um I heard about the engagement. And confused. Rach, sweetie, II umI didnt propose to you. I dont think you do. Poor baby, youre so tired. Rach, I didnt propose to you, Joey didnt propose to you, and Chandler didnt propose to you. Joey proposed to you? Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her? Wait! Whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring? Whoa! You were down on one knee? Then what did happen? Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?! What?! Uhh No. But II was going to see if yknow, maybe you uh, start dating again but thatI mean that-that was all, Rach. No, you didnt! I cant believe you told her I was going to propose! Hey, Im not going to rush into anything! What? Thank you. Good weird? Were so lucky. Look, II know its not a proposal and I dont know where you are, but with everything thats been going on and with Emma andIve been feeling. Yeah? Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, ummthen maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again. Well good, okay. II, kind of think yknow if weif Youre wearing the ring. And you told Phoebe you were engaged. When you thought Joey proposed diddid you say yes? You said youd marry Joey? So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby? So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend. Well, Chandlers my oldest friend, but Joeys myNo! Ah! Rachel said shed marry you?! Okay I put most of the stuff away. In the closet. Linen closet. In the hospital. No I left the diapers at the hospital! Theres some in the bag but Ill run out and get some more. Sure what kind? Please take your time, its an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin. Blueberry it is. Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? Yep. Yep, can you believe it? Huh? Ooh you mean like a Huh? Ah actually we dont. What! You didnt do anything wrong?! Okay lets put aside that you accidentally picked up my grandmothers ring and you accidentally proposed to Rachel. And I can even understand that you couldnt tell Rachel, but why couldnt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didnt. Not using it right, Joe. Im gonna go. Give me the bag. Joey! Im not gonna hit you. No I dont. No. No! Give me the bag. Give me the bag. Joey, give me the bag. Joe Im not kidding. No! You ducked! Oh my god, this really hurts! What is the matter with you?!? Why dont we talk about this on the way to the hospital? I broke my thumb. You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. Why, does it look like Im having trouble with my misshapen claw? Just Ross! You know my birthday. October 18th. Actually Im a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing is not. Ah, Rachel I guess. Just ah just put roommate. I dont think that we are. Well, I thought so too, but then she said shed marry you. Yeah thats what she said. So I dont wanna be just anybody. You know what, its, its better this way anyway. I mean I dont know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Its just much easier if were just friends who have a kid. Yeah. Yes. I mean, its what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  Thats why they call them plans.  Hello? Im fine. Hey there you go! Hey. Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him. Okay. What, Rach? Right. Well, thats what Im here for. Want me to get that? So, so, is Mike coming to dinner? Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go. Thanks, I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift. Alright, we'll just, uh, see you when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic. Oh, what were the other two? I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and, hey, I know how hard it is for you, but, but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids. Yeah. Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror. Rachel, I know that you can. And you should. Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I'll wait for my mom, and then I'll meet you there. No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go. No! No, you know what? You're not going back in there, the baby's fine, now scram. Yeah, tell your story walking. Oh, Holy moly, are we in a pickle now. Okay, well the superintendant is not home. Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys. I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping. Can't hold her own head up, but yeah, jump out. Rach, you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay? You never cooked since 1996. Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think, listen, listen! A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment. Great. So let's get going? Somehow, over time, it got easier to be apart from you. I'm so sorry. And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby. What? Thanks. Oh. Y'know this? is incredible. Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck. Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop. Huh-huh, they already know it! Mommy! Well, I don't think that's us. You know, I think that's a good idea. Our babysitter just pounded down another Chardonnay. Bye, you guys. Thank you. Boy, we uhm, hadn't really thought of that. Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm, the first one we met with. She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm, she worked for her last family for three years. And she's a little mannish. Are you gay? So you're just like a, guy who's a nanny? Okay. Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy! Because, it's weird! What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? IIt's like if a woman wanted to be. King? You gotta be at least bi. Is everything allright? And I'm fine never having heard it. Rach, can I, can I see you for a sec? Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in. Okay, okay, see, that, that is the problem. He is too sensitive. Yeah, I mean, all things that guy. These are amazing! This, this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes, makes, delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even, butch, manly cookies with, with, you know with, with chunks. Hey, there's sensitive, and there is too sensitive. Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny? Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines? Lighter than air. But that's not the point. Hey.! Rachel and I hired a male nanny. Thank you! a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence? Wow! Science? Academia? Being a good father? Uhm. Rachel and I hired a male nanny. Hey. I made up that joke and told it to you! Yep! That's my thing. Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice. I swear to God.! Okay, okay. How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets? Oh my God! Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me. Well, you know what. II'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there. But I just. I can't. I can't go through with this. No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you, to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with. Thank you! Here goes. Sandy. Hi, we uhm, we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out. Yeah, uhm. I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great, with Emma, uhm. We just feel. I, just feel that the, the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're, we're more than happy to give you good recommendation. Anyway, uhm. Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings. No, you know, it's uhm, nothing you did, it's, it's uhm, my issue. You know, I'm just not uhm, that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you. Why. I. I don't know. Uhm, errrr, maybe, maybe because of my father? I mean, uhm, you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy. You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now. I play squash.! Anyway, uhm. I uhm. I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive. It was hard. I remember. I was in my bedroom, playing with my dinosaurs, playing and learning, and my father walks in and says, he says. What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you, why aren't you outside playing like a, like a real boy? I know I am! And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top? Here come some more. And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Hi. Guess what? I made Emma laugh today. Yeah, and it was uhm, it was like a real little person laugh too. It. I uhm. Well, I sang, well actually I rapped. Baby. But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a. Please don't take her away from me! Hey! Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh, what'd you do to get her to laugh? You sang Baby Got Back didn't you? She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette. Yeah! Yeah! Hell yeah! Shake it! Shake it! Baby got back Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing. Rachel please! That is so inappropriate! A lot of people are thankful for those. Jill? Hey Amy. That was me. Still me. Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. All me. Monica and Chandler's Apartment. Sure, we don't live there but. I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD. Don't say that. Sure, you want to go upstairs? You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis. Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job. Hi. Thank you Amy. Emma. Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler. Woah. Woah, nearly really drops the plate and more seriously Woah. well, its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents. No, that that is not what we're saying. Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin, someone who can be firm and strict. No, you both are equally capable. Its just, you're strongest when, when you're together. Sure, Monica would have to give her up. Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before. Emma. Too far, Amy. Too far. Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma. So, so now do I get Joey? Wow! Wow, You look, uh. It's just, ah. That dress, uh. Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good. Oh right, right. So, are you, ah, you excited about your, your first night away from Emma? Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over. Yeah. We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation. I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced I have some experience in that area. Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun. So. Welcome. I got bottled breast milk. Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano. You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college. No. Um, ah, you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah. Phoebe said you. You've been divorced? That's okay. We'll talk about something else. Yeah. Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about. Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been? I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager. I don't know. We could look it up. So soon? Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer. Ah yeah. Good times. Uh, hi. Why? But you left. Maybe you should look up fascinating. I don't understand what just happened here. Oh God. Oh, you know, we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct. Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously. Hello. Ah, no, she's not here right now. Can I take a message? Bill from the bar? Okay, Bill from the bar. I'll make sure she gets your number. So, ah. So, how was it? Uh, did you guys. Did you guys have a good time? Uh, Rach. Never mind. Hey you guys. You're really not coming back? I can't get enough dinosaurs! You got me a cola drink?

What are you doing here, Santa? I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your partJewish friend. You sent. What are you doing? Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave. Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me. Hi guys. Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute? I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow? Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. Good one, Rach. Rach we have a code brown situation. Alright, but you have to do one sometime. What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even. What about Emma? We don't have a nanny. Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way. Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. Huh? So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now? Good-bye. Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing? I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something. Pants off Bing! Hey. You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine. Here's an idea. You walk into a room take a quick scan! You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual. Hey you guys! Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey. Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy. Yeah. Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I. Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it. Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by EmmaWemmaDemma, I love you - wovyou dovyou. Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits. What are you, a child? Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else. Whazzup? Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the hot nanny. You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me? Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. I am, yes. Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them. We have to stop them before something happens! Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute? Thanx. What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch? Yeah, come on in. Molly? Ok. Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem. Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we can we talk about what happened here last night? OK you you really don't know what I am talking about? OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony. Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum. I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, Why. Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine! No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but at least she could have told me. You know. I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me. Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental. Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants. That's funny. Do you think you'll ever work again? I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me. No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar. No. When he called, I. I threw the message away. You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there! You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You you break the. Don't you have to be at work? Hum. So hum. Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper another flood in Europe? Here’s a question: Would you. Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace. Right, so that's a firm no. I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out. This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone. I know! But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it. Uh-ah! Good choice Ross. Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am. Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle. Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing. Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this. How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that’s. I told you about my daughter. I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us. Are you kidding? We’ll see. I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies? Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep. When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week? Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go. Ok. You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it. Bye, bye. Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on. Oh, really! Oh, really! What about the guy from the bar? The guy you gave your number to. Because he called here looking for you. So don’t tell me this this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing, What? Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you do you not look there? I never gave it to you. I don’t know. Who am I? I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys! None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the point. Ok? The point is you you are the one. Uh, clearly. Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do? Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight? Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you. Yeah? Yeah, that'll do it. I'm, I'm okay. Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce. No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people. Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me. Yeah? Any names come to mind? Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle? Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me. Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date. No! Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be. Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight. Just the crab cakes. What's - what's going on? What? You - you're making money off my misery? This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way. Hey, what's wrong? Oh. Crab cake? Well, what happened? Monica told me you had a blind date. I did, too. But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up? Why does everyone keep saying that? That bad? Female body inspector? What size is that? The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters. Wait a minute you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid. So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising. Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down! Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. What? O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. What do you mean no? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. Yeah, a real pleasure. Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged! Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people. Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage! Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know, III was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week. Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone… … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: Gimme your money, punk! I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: Science Boy. A superhuman thirst for knowledge. Well, II better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe? Hey! No one ever asked me that, what's wrong? Oh… Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene… WhWhat are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude. No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old… Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me? It's not the best! There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. Hey, let's not do this! Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. Oh my god, crap from the street? Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years? You really thought Science Boy was worth saving! Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. You're welcome. Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that… I see. You didn't happen to tell… Great. Thanks! I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean. I'm happy for you guys. Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional. Hey! Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home! Why? Never? wow, are you still going to move in with him? Yeah, marriage, stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married. No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage. If you have to call me name, I prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian, and once afterward. I'm sorry. But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike. Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal! The Divorcer, to the rescue! Yeah I just hurt it. Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross: The DivorceForce. Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful. Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you. Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo? I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so, normal. Hey hey, can I help? You know sometimes your words, they hurt. Oh yeah, let me just finish this. Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to. It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing, remember Andrea Rich? Uh uh, well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident. No. I already e-mailed her. You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat. What do you think you learned how to do in the last two minutes? Alright, let's go! I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house! I have sex with dinosaurs? That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long. It's not funny! I can't believe you put that on my alumni page! You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today. Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE! I'm dead? Posting that I died? That really isn't funny. Oh please, hit by a blimp? Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my, my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here. You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic. uhu uhu, check this out. Eh.actually no, I don't need to because your little Ross is dead joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!? What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead! I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! You're right. There isn't a decent outlet. Exactly! No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me! oh, too late, too late! It's sent, oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man. It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted! Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! Who is he? I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. I'm dead and no one cares? It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here! Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it. I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone? Yeah. But you didn't! I'm still alive! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people! Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me! No thanks! Uh sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart. The woman just vanished! No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I. I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times. Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki. Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her. They're towing your car, they're towing your car! They're towing a car. And I am seeing spots. Yeah, uh, and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it! Think he washed his hands? Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery! A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance! You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah! That thing gets hot! Uh, you're not gonna win. Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that. Why would I eat my own arm? Why? You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here. I don't know, probably just invest it. Oh, I'm sorry, did I say invest it? I meant be cool and piss it all away. Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy? Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel Mommy when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not. Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me Daddy too. I. I was just talking about Rachel. Well that depends, have you been a baaad gi, no I can't. I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together! 3 minutes ago! I don't know why that's important. Than I want mine, too! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond. Hey, hey! Monica! Go, go, go! Weird, your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon. Oh yeah, it's a good idea! Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl. Phoebe's totally ruined that for me. Oh, we have one too! Come on! Oh yeah, no no no that's great! Oh, Rach oh. gleba is not a word. Okay, what does it mean? I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words. Yes you did, gleba is a word! Ok, use it in a sentence. It's not a word! Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt. She's gonna be a scientist! Me too. So much for my dinosaur Amelia Earhart theme park. Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers. I guess if everybody else is. Hi! I'd love to! Phoebe, what happened? Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance. Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge! Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn. I guess. It still seems a little, moonlight boat ride! The big apple! Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody. Check again please! Not there. She doesn't know what to say! Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if, if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves. Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm. I take six! C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time! I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple? Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave, and I feel like I am forgetting something. Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. What did you get? Nice, put it with the others. We are four short of a bush-o. God I feel so alive, I love being in the country! Oh, that's not cool. No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through. Not my first time in a hotel, my friend. No, no, no, you can't take the remote control! Let's celebrate with some maple candy! At least tell me where you hid it. Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Oh my god. There's something new in the bowl. No, but I want. I want the pinecones! It's not the same. Thank you for a delightful stay. Oh, my maple candy! Hi you guys! what's going on, you, you guys wanna hang out, or? do you, do you guys hear a buzzing? Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett. What? How come that you don't have to go! Hey! Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today. There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus. It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches. These aren't suede. Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller. Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice. Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out. Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute. We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover. I don't think so. Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is if you can't come on time, then don't come at all. An option that many of my students use. Shall we? You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok? Oh, damn it! So, where did you get your undergraduate degree? Oh, it's not over! So basically all nuts? I've lost the will to live. What? Oh, ok, fine. But, ehm. I just have one question for you, ehm. When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll. Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica. Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department. Ranion's theory of species variegation? Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny. Really? Wh-what's wrong? I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue. Wh-what's going on? No, I arranged that. So, eh, it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh? Ooh, so sad. Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer? You, you dated Albert Wintermeyer? And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like, like calling Albert Einstein, er. Alby. Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10! Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry, it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood. Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize? Two? Wha? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart. Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize? Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him? Huh, huh, what a loser! Some more wine? Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my, eh. average-sized brains out. She, she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth. Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God! Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians. Can we walk? Oh, you, you like that? What? Nice to meet you. Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys. I'd lead with that. It's actually a 1,000,000 prize. Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited. And sexy. Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her. Stop going through my stuff! Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? I'm smarter than him! Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE! Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss. Why do you care so much? Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils. Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it. Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was! I'm gonna get some more coffee. Ok. Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them, those-those people are stupid, I hate those people. Yeah, I know the type. Hi! Oh, do you, do you really? Look, if you don't know what the word acrimonious means, just don't use it! Get to the problem! Are you wearing two belts? You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid. You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship. Fine. Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET! Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans! Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love. But I'm not! You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food. Ok. Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire. Now, do you have any idea what you just said? Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt MONAY. I just. I wrote that out phonetically for you. Yeah, yeah that means, you know? We just, we don't have time for this. Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly! Wow. What does that mean? Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance? Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings. No! Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die! Respectfully, professor R. Geller. Hey! Hey, how was the Met? Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh? What do you mean? Wait a minute, when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right? Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together. What? What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on. Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else. And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is. That was going to be my next argument. Hey! Glad I could help man. Hey, you guys! Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference? Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing? Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today. Yeah, well. I think I know how to dazzle him. Tsz. NO! Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. II I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me. It's in Barbados. So-so what did the doctor say? How do you feel about all this? What? What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben! The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering. I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles! Oh, that's not what you want. Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there? I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker. It could be better! He, uhm, he fell asleep! Barbados. What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder. I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job! Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right? Can you say Barbados? Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh. I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars. Oh, right, because he's a scientist! Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow. It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility! Look at all these paleontologists! Wow! This is very flattering, uh. Uh, uh. Sure! Um. Dear. Sarah. I dig you, Uh? Doctor Ross Geller. Yeah, oh and Sarah. I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani. Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives, there's no the. Hey! You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs! Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz! Yeah, what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz? Ready to go? Yeah. I'm good, I have dinner plans. Uh, Joe, have you looked outside? By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. The chocolates aren't here yet. If you want to check your email, just ask! Wha, what do you mean? What, oh my God. What did you do? Why, why would you open it? What did it say? What, what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler! NO! I don't! Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament! Get out! Well, what do you do? I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say? I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe! Wha, what you really think we can do that? Alright, ok, let's do it. Um, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating, um, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the, eh, there's the overview of the Triassic. Yeah, that's it? Oh my God, we did it! Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace. Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? Oh my God, I love you. That's Ben, my son from my first marriage. Yeah. No. Oh, it was, it's complicated, you know? She, she was, eh, gay. Ok, odd thing to get excited about! Hey! High-five! My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter. I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay. And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome? Me neither. Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much. Good night. Walls are pretty thin, guys! Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating. Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus. And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development. But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus.  and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus.  in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you! Oh, thanks guys! Oh! Ok, now, now we're just holding hands! Oh, thank you so much! Ok! All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here! Ok! Uh, excuse me? Yeah? Hey! Well? Yeah? Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean, uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me? No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star! I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room! Look, I took it too far! Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. Get Out! Yes, please! So, what's going on? Oh my God, wh-what happened? I knew that was him! Hey, you ok? Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I, you-you will have to catch us first. GO, GO, GO! Hi. Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest. I don't think they saw us. Oh. Can I, can I ask who? I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so. I'm sorry, we, we can't. I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!  finally. God, you're amazing. I didn't even have to ask you to call me that. Weh. sigh. Yeah, It's just. I don't think I can do this. No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it. Alright, I'm gonna go find them. I just need a, need a before I can, you know. Grandma, grandma, grandma. Okay, I see you later. Hey, what are you guys doing? Okay, uhm. Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere? Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him? Thanks! Thank you! Rach, you there? Rach? Is everything okay? Hey. You know where Joey is? Can I talk to you for a minute? And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me. And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her. Anyway, one thing lead to another, and, oh, before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be? You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace. Hey! You guys ready to go? Dude! You're not taking your Bible? Learn about Jesus. Hey! Uh, no, no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane. Stop it! You're filthy! Uh, actually I think she went to the salon. Ye. Yeah. Yeah. You got shellfish in your head. You've never said that in your life, have you? I thought so. Oh, I uh, I mean, I, dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie. No, I'll do it. Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free. Hey Rach. Do you mind if I sit here for a sec? Hey! So, I uhm, kinda need to talk to you about Charlie. Okay, last night after you guys broke up, so sorry to hear about that, by the way. Well, Charlie and I were talking, and, well. Wha. What? What would give you that idea? Yeah, we kissed, but, nothing else, nothing else happened, okay. What? Are you serious? I am speachless. I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that? No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous. You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now. I may have to rethink some stuff. Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you. Thanks! Hi! Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk. Yeah! Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is. He is an amazing guy. Well, I'm so excited about this. Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this. Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie. Okay, shoot! Oh, major shampoo explosion! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying? Oh, not another one! Oh my G. And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people? So you two are? And have you, ed? But if I hadn't walked in here, would you? I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts? Hey, hey, hey. If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine! Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like. But now that I've had time to absorb it Lovin' this. It's all working out! Me amp Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do? No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook! Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas! I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in. Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things! What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine? You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas. The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is goood. Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'. I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension. We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go? My fajitas! Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate! That is gonna hurt tomorrow! Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey. And to love. Ah, love. LOVE, love. L is for life. And what is life without love? O is for oh, wow! The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own. Totally. No! Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel. Okay. Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed! Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone. Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good. I don't even know what that's for. Thanks. Did you stay here all night? So you took off my pants and shoes? What do you mean? Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine! Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long? This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel? Joey. And she feels the same way? Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on. No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she? Yeah, I'm sure. WOW! I'm sorry, it's just, how did you get so tan? Eh, you got a spray-on tan? Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators? Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on. I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one! So, do you get colours or just French tips? Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video, florist. Well. I like how you look, what are you? Two, I think a two. Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat. Well, I have a PhD, so. One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis. WAIT! WAIT! I'm notI've not finished counting! You sprayed my front twice! I went to that tanning place your wife suggested. Oh! And it gets worse! How do you count to five? Damnit! I Know! I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's, and I want them all on my back. Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it? Which, which, which. Which one is it? OH! SON OF A BITCH! Go away! I don't want to see anybody. Really? Did you count Mississipily? Dude, you're not tanned. Yeah! No. C'mon you guys, this is really important to us. Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister. Hey guys! Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video. Yeah! That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet? Ah, and where is Joey? Hey, there is uncle Joey! Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday! When they see this you'll be 52! Hey! Oh, great! Thank you so much for that gift! Amazing, amazing. Sure. Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties? I am this close to tugging on my testicles again. Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. That is a weird sentence! Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake. Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok! You guys, just please, a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember, the frosting? huh? Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you?. Ok, I'll be right there. No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her. No, wait! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone? Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! RACHEL! I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver. Yeah? Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. Rach, she's not going to remember this. Hey! It's not bad. Well, I just made these two things uhm, cheeks. And then I split this to make ears. Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures. Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs. Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means. Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake. Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake. Well hey, well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma. What's wrong? Are you okay? Okay, you ready? A-a-and, record. Hey. Oh. Ohh. I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers. B, B, B, B, B! Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt. Damnit! Hi Amy! Still sharp as a tack! Ross? I. I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year. I had a baby with your sister! Yes, yes, you did. Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants! Ehm. Her name is Emma. What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart! Oh my God! What, what you working on? Why don't you use your Thesaurus? Watch. Here, you ehm. You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates. 'gives'. 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest. Seriously? Well, do you wanna marry him? Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it! No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting? I don't think that's what this is. Well, can I talk to you for a sec? Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child. Fine, we'll call the next one Ella. Okay, um. I don't want her watching our baby. I. I don't know. Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. Why not? Come here Oh! There she is! Hi! What? Hi! What. Please tell me those are clip-ons. Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her! That's not a thing! Amy, I ju. I just. I just wanna. No more falafel for you! Pheebs, what's wrong? So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals! Hey! Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you. Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything, five! Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the Paleontology Review! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work! Yeah. Why? Your ex-boyfriend? So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed! Well, if you think it would help. Ok, now, is there anything I can do to, you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes? We'll see how dinner goes. Well, I. I am having a good hair day. I'm ok. It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field. No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with, tzz-zzz, mmm. Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert. See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated. What? Did you just say break up with Charlie? Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? Are you serious? No! I guess! What? I. I. May 12th? Wha? I need 6 graduate students. Wha? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology. um. I've never heard of a Boscodictiasaur. Ok. B - O - S. Oh come on! No! Stop! Really? I have to break up with Charlie? You're crazy. Crazy! Get out! Your ex-boyfriend is insane. No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you. Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up. Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of Underdog? If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question. Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm. How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur? Damnit! I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you. Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog! No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth. Too little, too late, Benji! No! What? or. Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable. Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE! Hey you guys! Hey, what are you doing? Yeah! There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money. Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that. I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture! No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that! Hi! Oh, good! Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there. There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge! Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground! Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire! Be-caaauuuse. Seriously? And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie! Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see! Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it. Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you? Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings! Ok. Rach, she’s got like three hairs! I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this. Here we go! See, I told you! Oh, absolutely! Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow! SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice. No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears. Good. WHAT? WHERE? WHERE? I know. Ok. This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing! See? There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore. Well. Whaa, aaah, aaahhh. Are you kidding? That doesn't sound like you. That's Monica talking! She's putting words in your mouth! Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has! Dude, I wanted him to guess. Guess where they are? Did I do something to you? So? He's right, man. We're still going at the game, right? Yeah. Oh! What a game, huh? I can't believe Chandler is missing this! Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away. I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner! Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal. One more fight! Okay. Forty-five minutes. Here! You may want to lose the foam finger! Hey! We're late too! So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us! Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy! You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee. Let me see this. Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division. You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant? I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable! So this is an annual thing? Yeah. What are we gonna do? Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged! HEY! I got mugged. And they stole my pocket. That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around. We know you're out there. Well, let's just go in there and face them. What is that? Wha? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy. Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri? Our subway broke down. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF! How are we gonna decide who gets this? That's worse than no food. I don't know. Yeah, he can do it! I feel terrible. Really girls, not cool. It's a day to be thankful. Yeah! Let's go out. Okay. I gave them to Joey. I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him. Nice! Hey! Come on, she's gonna love you guys! Hey! Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice. How does this look? C'mon! This looks good! Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool! Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. You're wearing the same shirt. You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous! Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! Wow, this is really soft. Three hundred and fifty dollars? Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Wow! Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys? All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here. Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. Really? So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers? So? What do you think? Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here. Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies? You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME! Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this. Here So this was fun! Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. Because it's soft. Hey, so how was your date? Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? Food. Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice. I just can’t see Chandler cheating! I know, and with the baby coming? I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you? No one, I’m just saying if. I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical! Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I. We think Chandler might be having an affair. What's going on? Oh my God. So you wanna buy a house in the 50's? You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay. It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay, but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be. What? You put an offer on a house? Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place? You can see where he'd have trouble. That money is mine, Green! What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie? Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie… Correct. Her actual favorite movie is. Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there? Two seconds. 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast? No, 19. Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was? Correct, his profession was? Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job? 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game. Don’t blame the questions! Chandler! Chandler! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here! What the hell are doing?! I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! II cannot believe this! My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys, are just having dinner or, watching TV or something, but, it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window. Love you guys. I love this. Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for? Really? Which one? Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on Pyramid! Except for Match game. Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond. Yeah-uh! and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll! So weird to see all these people again. Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric. He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff. Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her. Dude. You're married to my sister. Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out? Yes please. Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room! Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24 point! Hey, Missy. Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called Way! No Way! Boss! She's gone. Dude, I was gonna ask her out. Well, I thought it first, Holmes. Woha! Wait. What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want. Me too. I'm good at it. You got it. Those are the pacts! Oh, oh, maybe not you! Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college? I know, and I can't stop sweating. So, Saturday night! Great! Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing? It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt. That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out! Yeah, why? You did? AND ON MY TURF? You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me? You broke the pact! That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship. I didn't. No. NO! I never did anything with Adrienne Turner. I don't know what, you're talking about. Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this. Cool! I didn't know you knew about that. Man. I. I'm sorry. So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even. We are even, right? What did you do to my mom? Hey, where's Rachel? Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel? Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school. Well, it matters to me. Because, the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time. Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but, it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first. Mine. No, she was definitely on my bed. Well, then who was on my bed? NO! No, no! You were under the pile of coats? OH MY GOD! You were my first kiss with Rachel? Hi! Oh, hey, oh. I. I wasI was going for a hand shake. That is why! Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid? I wanna say it's not looking good. What? Oh, man! FOOTBALL! I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding. And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it. Who cares, AND? I'll do it! No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean, watch! Huh? Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman. Please, you're going down! Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team? So, what did you decide? I'll do it! Hey! Where's Rach? I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! Oh! My God! You're breathtaking! You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you? I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me! Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time! YES, YES! Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding. Well, you have fun tonight. Oh, I will. Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you? I'm not supposed to tell you! Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose. Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs. I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today. No, but Chandler, hello. Aren't you scared of dogs? Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa. He stinks! Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free. I'll. It's the dog. Uh Joey. Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down. Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MAAKE! I did not sign on for this. Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé. It was ok. Hey. You guys know where Rachel is? So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. Hey! What? She's gonna eat all those cookies? So, why is Erica coming to visit? Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late! No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's? Oh my God. Is-is he ok? Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now. Still-still, let me come, for me. I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies. Oh! And I'm Doctor Ross Geller. Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him. I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick! I'm feeling better. He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine! Did the TV wake you? Ouchy. Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new? Right, is it painful? Nope, just the one. RACH! Hey! I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack. Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great. Wow. Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room. Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room. Sorry. You ok? You had a rough day, uh? But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach! What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look. They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok? No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest. Good night. Sure! Oh, of course. Me too. Come here. Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or. Oh, oh. No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea. No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you. Look, I'm sure it would be great, but II think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go! I'll see you in the morning. Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that! Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay? You sure you're alright? O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. There it is. Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing. Well. I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding. Hey, I was looking out for you. I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever. Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again. That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better? Emma's down for the night. So uh. I guess I wanna take off. Oh, no problem. Thank you. I'm glad you agree. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Oh, ye-ah! Valentine's day. Hmmm-mmmm. Not even once. Even if we want it really bad. Uhm, right! Yeah. I hate waste. Yes? Damn it. It's never off the table. Hey, you guys. I have great news. Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure.! Guess what happened at work today. Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhh. My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good. Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid. No, no. II'm good. I'm up for tenure. You too! What are the odds? Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here? I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE! This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses! Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery. Hey Rach, so uh, how did your thing go? Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. IIII can feel it. And-and to years of hard work finally paying off. But also knowing it means a lot. that center around work. You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired. No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me. Rach, I'm so sorry. Great. I feel like an idiot. Oh. Little heads-up would have been nice. I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway! Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so. Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before? That is Mark? I hate that guy. No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him. Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary. I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay? Hey, is Rachel here? She's still at dinner? That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's. She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her. We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants. Hey, so uhm. How was dinner? Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want? Should we send something? Congratulations! Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest. So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris? Okay. All right, we'll work it out. Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want? Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this? Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it? I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off. I didn't say we were brothers. Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago. Close. Ron. Uhm, well. I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back. Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back. Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true? Huh, I took a shot there. I see. Thanks very much. Is this your son? Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance? How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils! You let Rachel come back, and it's done. Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life. He'll be fine. Hi. Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it. Ok. Nooo! So, you're not going to Paris. Wh… wh…what? Yeeeah! It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back. Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica. Huh? So? We have a deal? Yes! yes! Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it! Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. Hey! What? They did? So, what are you gonna do? That's great! So you're staying in New York! You're excited, right? Right! Uhm, I hadn't no you. I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared. You should go. It's what you want. You should go. I really do. I'm sure he'll understand. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, oh! Then I'm happy too. Hey! Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten. Right, no, I understand. No, no, I knew. She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon! Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys? Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product. Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place. No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey? Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie. Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy. What are you guys doing? You got it! All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him! Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out. Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard. Yeah? Yeah, where is it? Rock on! Hey, where's Rach? Great. Here she is! Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel? Yeah? Hey, what do you think they're doing in there? Hey. What was that all about? Are you kidding? Oh my God. Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations. Oh no, she took down Monica. And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing. Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her. I don't think so. God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long? Okay, here we go. Yeah. Huh? What? I don't get a goodbye? Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me. Well, it needs to be plicit. No, I don't think so. O-kay. I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU! THE HELL I DO! I don't get a goodbye? Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things. Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good. IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. That's what it seemed like. Fine, then why didn't you say something? Rach! You keep, you keep. You can't. Rach! Hey. Oh. This was amazing. Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me Sex for Dummies as a joke. Who's laughing now? What? Oh my God! Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl. Is Rachel here? Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out. Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it! I know, it's pretty great. Oh, I. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk. I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together. Shhh! Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not. Hey. Hey. How did you sleep? Good. Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute? So. Morning. It really was. I know, me too. It was. You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be. And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye. Nothing! What do you say to that? No way! What? You really think so? Okay. Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel. What? What? Oh my God! I'm not getting you a muffin! Hey. No, and I'm not going to. Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun. Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is. Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time. Oh my God! You did that yourself? Oh my God! Oh my God! Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right? Oh my God. Aw, he's gonna be so happy. Neither will I. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her. I don't! I wanna be with her. Yeah, I'm gonna go after her. My coat. I don't know, but I. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?! Okay, guys, wish me luck. There's no seatbelt! Alright, alright, let's do this! Hey! No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab. Get out of the cab! Are we off the bridge? Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive? Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down! Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab! What? Okay! To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab? Not since my cop-show got cancelled. What? We're never gonna make it! Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. Hey, I need a ticket. Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets. I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest. Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it? No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes. What? Hey, hey, listen. Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica? That's alright. Listen, listen. Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica? That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information. Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board. What? JFK. Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no! Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time. I am not doing this over the phone. Yay. Where is she? Rachel! Rachel Green! Rachel! Rachel! No, no, I just have to talk to someone. No, no, no, but. Okay, the thing is. Don't go. Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go. I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane. Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do. No, you don't. No, you don't. Rachel? I really thought she'd stay. Oh my God! Let her off the plane! Try to understand! No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane? You got off the plane. I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again. Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid. This is it. Unless we're on a break. Don't make jokes now. Wow. Uh, I haven't. Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
