What?! What are you talking about? Who’s the father? Why not? As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin? Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal. Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya. No? I’ve been taking dancing lessons. Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget. So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife? I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery. Not well. Thank you. Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so. Funny: ha-ha or funny: What size shoes do you wear? Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume? Those aren’t eleven and a half. And the world will never know. Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives. But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet. Did it turn into sand? No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot. Why? Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite. And I’m the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to! We got the honeymoon. The wedding pictures? Not the disposable cameras from the tables. I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home. What? What did you take a picture of? Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet? Oh. Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You’re 32! Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff? Yeah but you don’t need——What is this? Score! Where are the disposable cameras? The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said… So you don’t have the cameras?! So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak! Great. Hey! Did you find the cameras? Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating. Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed. All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up! Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? Are you serious? Marriage advice? Really?! I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers. She picked those out too. That was her. I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop? Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us? Uhh… Yeah sure. Click! Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here! Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech. Okay, you ready for the last picture? Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding. We’re back! It’s picture time. Here’s a picture of Ross. And that’s me. And that’s me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple. Eh? Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need——There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now. Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together! Call it even?! Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon? Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama… I’d better go pack. A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. Hey, what was that all about? What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?! What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets. Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper. You already know. Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love. We are on our honeymoon. 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together? No. Just act like you belong. Shh! Nice to see you again. Yes, of course. Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A. Apology accepted. Excuse us. Oh you’ve got to be kidding me. We’re you just ten seconds later! We need the stuff. What else is new? Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together. They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city. I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with. Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance… We really…didn’t get a chance to… Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines! Y’know who has a great video camera? Let’s call ‘em. Here you go. What? I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked al l those insightful, great questions. Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong. I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! Well maybe it was all of your questions. The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler! Was that another question? Did you do it on our invitations?! So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex! Jenny! That is so Jenny! You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn? What’s funny about that? Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go? The Hard Rock Café? Again?! You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob. Yeah, he thinks that’s my name. Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby. No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. Shh! It is a family name! Hey Bob. If I see him, I’ll ask. Yeah! We’re on a semi-first name basis. Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes. But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here. I think it’s best sir. Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em. What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! Sure, what’s up? Hey Bobby. Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why? Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here. Bob! Well that puts me in a difficult position. Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
