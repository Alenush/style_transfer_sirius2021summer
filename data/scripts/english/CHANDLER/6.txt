Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married! Oh my God! Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!! Hey! Yes! Well that-yes. We actually missed it. What?! Hi! So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet? It’s a buffet man. Listen, I gotta talk to you. Monica and I almost got married last night. Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her? What?! Hi. Hey! Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or... You did. Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free. I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you! So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you. Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there’s a definite sign that we should get married. Sounds great. Ready! Yes, yes eight. That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess. That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit! Yeah. We’re doing the right thing, right? Well you did pull his hair. I’m not getting into this again! Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay. No! All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it. Me too! No! Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here? Well, what if all my stuff was here? Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying? Me asking is kind of a sign. Okay!!!!! Okay. Oh thanks. The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?! Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in! This is not a sign! It’s an old key! I love you! Are you hugging the door right now. Yeah-yeah, me neither. The key’s stuck in the lock. It still doesn’t work. Oh. Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen. Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine? No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict. No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I’m sick. Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time? All right. No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man. Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you! Hey! What gave me away? Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya? Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave. Hey. Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously. Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty... All yours babe. Rach... Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen? Well, Joey’s my best friend. You just said. Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though? Okay. Oh yes. Hey-hey! I am now! Okay, bye! Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff. Not once did we do that. Hey! Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it? And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry? Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?! Hey! Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about? Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man! Who was it? Sure! Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones! Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely." So, that’s it? Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game! I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away! No, I’m not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room. Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight. "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice! Hi. Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em. Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women... Really? Ohh. That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room. We don’t have to come up with this now. Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room? Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. Is that a problem? Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over. Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work! In the game room! All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I’ll be living here. Why did you take the shower curtain down? Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. That’s laughter. I don’t know. Yeah, I do. He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! Yeah, I'm not so worried. Of course! Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. Okay! Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man! Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too! Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?" Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge! Really?! Hey! Oh, what’s the matter? Yeah? What?! Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go? Oh hi! Why don’t you open with a joke? Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?! That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19. Hey. Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild. "Benefits lapsed." Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year. All right. I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to stop catching on fire. Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. Hey! That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now? What’s wrong with you? This sounds like a hernia. You have to, you-you go to the doctor! That’s a hernia. Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?! I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing...pushed back in. Hey. Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix! Listen, I’m really glad you got the part. But are you sure you can do this? Now, is that never talking about it again?! I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras! What are you doing? Oh, all right. What? Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage? Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya? You left a shoe here?! Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe. Yeah, all right. Whoa-whoa-whoa! What? Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies. Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense. I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around... Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone. Hey! Shocking! Since you still have the keys. What equity investments? You don’t even have a car! And? There you are. Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe! They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass! Glass, sand, whatever. All right. I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. I swallowed the sonic blaster gun. Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. But you found the keys to his clothes? That is true. Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me. I think that’s gum. Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go. Hey! Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. And protected them from a tornado? Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph. Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! Okay! Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. First of the month. No, just the months you actually want to live here. Okay, here is the phone bill. That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just... why don’t I just cover you for a while? It’s not charity, Joe... Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. Uh, yeah. So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then? No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it. I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride. Well that would help the pride thing. Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow? Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? Hey! Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing. Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey. Yes, but for the last time. He’s at a dinner party. Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese. Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? Yes it would. What do you say to $50? Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently. Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000. Oh yes! Okay. No! No! No! No......one can beat me. See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. Still broken? Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? Okay, uh, how about, how about...y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun. Cups. I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun. Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have? Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. What do you got? You’re kidding right? Well that’s a full cup! You win. It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Not 700 exactly? Double it! Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get...No way! What’s wrong? Wh-How did you lose at Cups?! Oh man!! All right, let’s play one more hand! One more! I can’t take the big white dog! You love it! No, but wait...what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500? When did I try to give you money? I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay. Hey. I know. No problem roomie. Sure! I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. Exactly. It’s not a real game! I made it up! At a fake game!! Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open. I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. So, uh, wh-where ya from? Unbelievable Hey, look at all the boxes! All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket? Now imagine you live at the supermarket. No-no OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack. Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me? Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing? What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning! Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back. Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it. She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place. She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it. I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out. No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh. Hey Mon, how's it going? Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad. No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there. It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me. We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it. What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table. OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch. Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the... blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd...btyds...Rooosss!!!! Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine? Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that. That's not specific to girls. And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica. Okay, is this lamp in the same place? No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked. I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed to see me naked. Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later. Bye! Thank God Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place. That's perfect! That's brilliant! Uh-huh No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do you want me to be afraid of you? Really? Oh well you're the best. You come here to me. Ba dum bumb cheshhh! Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source? So, is Janine around? Can I check out what she did to my room? Oh my God. What is th... it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It’s spreading already. Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch? Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in? No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff. Yes talk to her. Be a man. Defend yourself. Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation. Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary? Ohh, yeah. That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either. Yeah let’s head off to work. You know. Oh My God. Really. Yeah, what was wrong with your old, human teeth. No, no no no. You’ll be fine. Hillary’s blind, right? Yeah. What??? I am proud of all my friends today. Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s. Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing. You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall? No thanks, Josephine. Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men??? Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers. What is the matter with you ?!? You’re arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!! You’re turning into a women. Now I’ve upset you? What did I say? Sidney Poitier? Hehheh. Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in! Why can’t I tell them that we live together? Why haven’t you told them?! Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?! Why wouldn’t they be happy? What? What? Why?! Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me? Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em. Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I? Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right? Well Monica just told me that they don’t. Do you know why? Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess! This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for. Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment. . Hey. Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! Whoa, snowing out there? Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show. Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at- What? You do? Why? What?! Why did you do that? How could it not matter?! What about all that "friends forever" stuff? Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me! The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this? Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert. Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it. Thank you! I’ll talk to them! Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights. I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me. See now it feels like Christmas! Hey Joe what’s up? I can see why that’s hard to resist. You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right? Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? What, what are you laughing at? I don’t think so. Oh my God! I can save you time ladies, I’m right here. What? That’s terrible! Oh well, that makes it not terrible. No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents! No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too. Why? No, I have a great idea for a present for her. If I help, we can find ‘em faster! Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you? You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey! Those are my gifts, I got them for you. Those are book ends! That's a great gift! Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay? Oh, hey guys! Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage? What? Oh great! Okay! Okay! Okay! Wait, we can’t do this. I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about. Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back? Fine! That’s what you got me? Now you do that, you’re on TV. That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up. I made that joke up. Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard. Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right? Seriously? Yeah, I guess. Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke. It’s my joke. Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up. Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny. What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out? Joey, why is your cable out? If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money? Whoa ho. All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place? Paid your phone bill? Yeah. So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions. You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. Yeah! Okay . He took my joke, he took it. You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. Yeah! Picking Rachel. Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape. I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse. It’s my joke. Let’s have Monica decide. Yeah! Mon, get out here! Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is. Because you’re the only one that can be fair. Don’t try to sway her. I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go. Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve. Can I finish my story?! So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. I’m not arguing with that. Is not. Hi, oh hi. Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and... ... generosity of spirit. I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again? You’re a little high maintenance. I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like.... maintaining you. I’m off the list. Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go? Hey. Joey! No way. I’m not answering that. This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half. Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work? I’m so sorry you’re sick. I’m gonna grab you some tissue. Yes? Oh my God, introduce us! Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy. Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person. That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe. Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh! Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep. I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy. Would you please get some rest! Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe! No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way. No-no-no-no-no! Okay. So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself? It’s nice. Yes! It’s all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up? Oh come on you big faker! Well that was before all the vaporizing action. Okay! What are you doing here? We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places. He’s taking off her coat! Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I’m off to bed! I’m good. Is that a swing? Yuck! That was like 5 years ago. Joey! Well see now that I can see crying over that, but Bambi is a cartoon! Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer! I’m not macho. No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy. I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry. Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich! Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin. Oh they didn’t want to come! No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?! You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you? Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer. Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn. Her ankle is what you’re watching? She’s just doing her job! Hey! There’s no back to this couch! Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside. Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. Yeah? Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then. Aww, I love you so... What?! So you didn’t mean any of that?! Hey. Maybe we should give them some privacy. I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out! I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. I can’t help it, I opened a gate. Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay. Sure I would! What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow? What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie. Hey. Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny." Was his question what’s more boring than him? Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride. Ehh. I could use the money; it could give me time to write. Okay! All right! Hey. Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real. Uh-oh, it’s my boss! Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans. What? But the Kit-Kats are all right?! Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead. Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I’m with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I’m lost and I can’t find food." Here you go Joe, here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. Yeah? I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp. Okay, anything for you sir? It’s not all juice! Who sold a story to Archie Comics?! Aww. You wanna share it? What’s this? Aww, thanks man. Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story. Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist... as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them. No, the doctors say it may kill her. But I think we should tell her. Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31. Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack. I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger. Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. "Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979." Okay. What was tonight? Okay. What was tonight? With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God! Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times! Nine. Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy? Hey that’s what I tell girls about me. No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you. Okay. So was I. We can’t do this. Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you. I do like that. Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right? Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it! Okay! I have some moves. Yeah, let’s just forget it. Okay! Oh yeah. Yeah? Oh my God! Oh, okay! Hey! Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you! So you uh, want to do something tonight? Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when... Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you? I bet he can. Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine! Okay to come in? Yeah I know, guess who beeped him? I’m the ruptured spleen. Because you shouldn’t be with him. You should be with me. Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend. I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a "doctor!" No, there were two. Oh yeah. Yeah. Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe. I see where you’re goin’! Ah, finally an explanation. Hey-hey, is Monica here? Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day. She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight. Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year. Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut. I made a... Nothing! Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for? This, this actually is a... Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts? Do we have to make the entire thing? Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up. What? Hey. What?! Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel? I can’t figure out what to make Monica. I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her. Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can’t do it. I can’t do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts? Okay, come here! Come here. Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it. But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs. Maybe we’ll have to listen and see! Okay! Yeah! It’s a sock bunny. Not really. I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies. Oh, it’s okay. I don’t... Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. Wow! You are way to young to have seen that! You are totally and completely 100% forgiven. Yeah! You have done enough! No you don’t...get it in black, not brown. Oop! Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake. Who the hell is Carl?! Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they? Oh my good God. Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now. Oh, the mixed tape. No! You’re the sweetest! I am so, so, so, so sorry! And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there! Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please? Okay. So, are we going in there? Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh? A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man. Oh, is that against the rules? I see. Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class. Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years. You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred. Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try. Yeah so, Tuesday? Thank you. You just thought of that in there? What are you smiling about? What is so funny? How’s your room Rach? Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman? God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been! Oh that’s great! Good for you. Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?! Hi! I’m back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. Okay, bye-bye. Hi. We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then. Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time. No, we only went out once. Not once! Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business. My friend’s name is Joey. Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie. The nerve huh? Refill? Hey. I couldn’t do it. Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight. Uh, Dana Keystone from college. No, that was Dana Caplin. Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo! Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay! Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no! No-no. Really?! Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh... Well maybe there is one thing you can do. Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday? Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. Ni-hi-ice! So, you busy Thursday? Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part? Really? No! No! No! I was so careful! Hey! So?! It’s Thursday! How was the audition?! Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. So he has to be a male who has at least $50. Isn’t she cute? No! So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do? Oh, tell her good luck with that. Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups? Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too. Why would our guy be a weirdo? A face ass? No, our guy is just a floating head. Wait! You look? You-you massaged me. Our guy has great hair. Our guy smells incredible. Hey. Well, you... don’t look good Joe. That’s still in there?! Is this a service you’re providing me? Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore. Uh-huh. Okay... Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready. Then you distract her with a Barbie doll. Joey, I saw you push him! Uh-huh. Hey! Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!" Yeah. Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible! Are you funny? Turns out he is kinda funny. Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name? Okay, so you will meet our guys? Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself. Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say? You know the hotels? Well, maybe you don’t marry this one. Good-good-good-good. Hey! Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here! Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now! There you go! There you are! Hi. Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy. It is the softest hair! Touch it! Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel! So what was it for anyway? Yeah. So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for? That is lucky. Now-now, why would you say that Joseph? Whoa, she's pretty. Oh, ok. Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Oh, are we playing this?! Hey! How’d the audition go? So it did go well. Oh that’s great! Oh my God! Oh-oh, what are you doing? Well, it is overdue. Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for Monica’s allergies. You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye. Am I naked again?! Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit? Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you. As crazy as soccer? You mean you didn’t get it from this? Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him! I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up. Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right? You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap! Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi! Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and... No! No! No! I just kissed her. How is that worse?! You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line. Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too! What happened?!! What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! So--You got in voluntarily?! BEND OVER?!!! Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. ...And what did you bring? Janice? Janice?! Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... Cupping. I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot! Do you think he’ll ever forgive me? Y’know what? I-I kinda have. You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know? I KNEW IT!!!! Oh my God! Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers. Please tell me you got the message! The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock. Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches! Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say. Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here! Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean! Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!! Oh, we could do this all day. You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya! All right! I think so. Yeah, get off me. Okay. Oh, well thank you in advance. Hey!! Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick? Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that. Hey! Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?! Ross! There’s a Mr. Bing! But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You’re roommate in college died didn’t he? Yes, we were just... Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby. No, the little girl creeps me out. Why would the baby creep me out? This is going in your book? Hey! Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants! So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me? Yeah, you wish. Who? Hmm. Oh. Oh-oh. We said seven! The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six. Oh my good God. What?! What does it say?! Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything. I told you I should not wear this color. So you knew we were gonna miss the movie! Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do? Hi, how are ya? The reason he just said. Yeah, I’ve been there my friend. Hey! I’ll give up my ticket. And I think Ross is generous too. Hey! Ross. You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. Yeah we are. This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom.... No! Not the groom!! See you later. Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. Right here! Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way! Okay. Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready. Okay. Totally. Yeah, it’s beautiful. I know. Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a...ah-ah! Paper cut! No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out. Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures. Me too. Hey. Oh all right. Oh well, we don’t because we got...the...other pl-place. Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It’s a beautiful selection. Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this. Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one’s nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one? Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please. Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you... hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it? Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000. Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring. No. How are ya Paul? No, did he hug you?! Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads. Yeah? I’m a little busy here Paul. Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay. Okay! Do you have my credit card? Thank God! Oh, I can’t go. Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first. What? They put you in jail? Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring! Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps. It was the ring! I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring! No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect. I can’t do that. Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger. Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him. Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew. No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you? Yeah, she’s dying.... Of a cough apparently. Okay, that’s enough honey! Great! Okay, here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman! Guys? I’ve got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me. Yeah, check out the ring. Yep, pretty much. Heyyyy... What? Okay! I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends. I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me. I know. Check out the ring. Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys? Okay, well tonight’s the big night. It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose. Yeah. I’m not gonna mess it up. She’s not gonna say no. Hey! Give me it! Phoebe! Hi Monica. Hey! Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?! I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going. Well, you could also give back the money you owe me. Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids. Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that! Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What’s going on little elves? Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs? Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know. You are beautiful. One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here. Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything are you are you perrr-perfect?! Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay? Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you. Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with.... I know, but just let me say it. What?! I’m Chandler! Oh, that’s Richard! Hey-hey, hey! I don’t know why I did that! And uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good. I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable. Hi. Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again. Yeah, I’ll sit down. Yes. I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. What?! Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! Richard! Oh you knew that. Good! For camp! Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year! What did you guys just do?! Richard was there so I couldn’t do it! I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it! Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?! This is terrible. What am I going to do? That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice. Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married? Hey! Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. Yeah, well... Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? Eh... Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports! If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?! It’s okay, I got a plan. I was making a coconut phone with the professor. What?! My... Oh my God! He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that! Well what... Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?! You’re right. Okay. I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna go find her and I’m just going to propose! Okay great. What?! Where is she? I’m not scared of you! Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica! Well where did she go? Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy. Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her? Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!! And what does she have to think about? I love her! But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised! It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight. Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring? Y’know Richard...you are a good guy. I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica! What? What are you talking about? Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?! Well where... Where did she go? I can’t believe I ruined this. Oh my God. Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
