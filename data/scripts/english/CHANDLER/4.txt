Hi there. Oh, I'll go out and get you some. Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go? I found a dried up seashores. All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? I've got canned goods. Excellent hole, Joe. Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?! We've got to do something! Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain. Me too!! Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you! Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!! I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us. They'll never understand! We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it. And then Joey remembered something. Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming. Coffee house? I KNEW IT!!!! We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked. Okay. All right. Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice! You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed! All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it. Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it! Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land. Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship. You want it? Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane? All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer. Nooo. I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living! Let it go!! Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails. You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe. All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away! Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong. Oh-no, he's right. I'm coming already!! OH MY GOD!!! Are you all right?! What happened?!! What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! So--You got in voluntarily?! BEND OVER?!!! Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!! Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us." Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it. Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away! Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?! Could we be more white trash? Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday. Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink. No. No! Well, not at first. Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level. Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself. Okay, I promise, I’ll end it. I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean. It was like the Algonquin kids table. It just doesn’t feel like we’re breaking up. Okay. Thanks. Okay. I’m getting dressed. When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me. What is it? Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy. You are, you’re gonna leave me like this? Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it! Hi! How are you? Hello, Joanna ’s office. How little?! Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now! Why not?! What?! Rachel, could I see you for a moment? Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit. I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well! It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out. No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and Never! Fine! I never borrowed your Walkman. You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh! No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants! About what? I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman! Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so! Well, this is much better. Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go. It still wouldn’t be clean. All I want is my freedom. Freedom! Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!! I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just No! With extra pulp? No! You don’t have it. How do Monica and Phoebe know? Go on. And Milton Berle has a Hello. I love you. Two hours, that lasted! I think so. Could there be more Kims? Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn`t say "cool" anymore. Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I`ve missed the last 1200 times. You don`t think I`ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria. Oh Maria. You can`t say no to her, she`s like this lycra spandex covered gym treat. No! Oh no, you`ll have to come. Why don`t you just give him to somebody else? Because that`s the only part of you he can see when he`s on the table! Yes. Yes! No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts! Okay. I wanna quit the gym. I wanna quit the gym. I wanna quit the gym. I wanna quit the gym. Hey. No, I almost did, couldn`t leave Ross there without a spotter! We`re doomed. Okay, they`re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do? You`re a genius! Now, there`s two reasons. Thank you, Joey. Hi. No, we`d just like to close them. I wanna quit the bank! To pay for the gym. Hey. Yeah... Bunny-rabbit. Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty. I could die. I tell people secrets. It makes them like me. Hey! All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice? Wish me luck. Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that? Uh Kathy, with K or a C? Oh-oh-hey! Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here. Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth. Hi! Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote. Oh my God! That's why I got up too! Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've... So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class. That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him. Is it on? Hey! Oh! It's on! It's on! There we go little fella. Well the duck can swim. Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty. She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what? No, I don't. Thank you, Ross. All right. All right. Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy. Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!" Okay. Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend. I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler! Really?! Right in there! 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time. Hey! Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate. Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week. You-you do? You got me. Yeah. Right. Okay. Ohh, she's-she's not really my type. Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings. Uhh, no-no thanks. Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. What? Hey, look, what do you want from me? I am pretending. Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!! Can I sleep on your couch? Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that? Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper? Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. Well, I have a call in about that. Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book. Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. It doesn't say that. Does it? Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great. It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? Sure... I don't know... um, Grease? Rent? Okay, so when do you want to go? Yes, it is, at Office Max. A pen. Huh-huh! You can't give her that. Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday? For three years? All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay? Would you like me to write her a little poem as well? Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff? She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? Where? I got something for her. It's a book! No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? No, it came out to an even twenty. Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift? Oh yeah? That's great! Aahhuuhhh.... Hey! Happy birthday. No he didn't. Happy birthday! I'm sorry. See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock. Oh, yeah... yeah. Goodnight. Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time. Uh, the book? What do you mean? Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell." Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. Goodnight. I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture! It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it`s bad enough that I`m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we`re in the room together there`s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I`ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she` s smooth! Smooth! Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that? Goin` out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn`t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer. What? Wait! You`re going out with Kathy! Well, I`m upset...for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she`s-she`s smart, and funny, and gets you. All right look, I think it`s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane. All right! Bring it on, you... Oh my God! Play! Really, bitchin`! You mean like, music? Yeah, I know what you`re thinkin`! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy. Come in! Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles. No-no, he`s not back yet, but he`ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern? I like it in the stern. of the boat. Hello. What happened? Why can`t you tell her? Joey! Joey!! I thought your time ran out. Uhh, that was Joey. He`s running a little late, he says he`s sorry. So I guess it`s just uh, you and me then. Yeah, I think it is! Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut.... ...and then it got canceled. Really?! You do that? Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don`t make my tail too poofy. Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y`know who also has great hair is Joey! What-what `cha doin`? `Kay. Oh the phone! The phone`s making sounds! Hello! Hey it`s Joey! What? Okay. Oh yeah man. Joey. Yeah. Yes! Yeah. Oh. No-no-no-no, this is bad! It`s bad! This is bad! Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation? Okay! Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here`s what we do, we-we forget it happened. Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we`re unhappy forever. Sound good? I have to; he`s my best friend, and you`re seeing him. Oh-no-no-no! Don`t! Don`t! See-see, you`re getting me confused, I`m starting to urn. I-I think we have too. Bye. Are you still out there? Hang on buddy! I sure did. Well, I just thought it`d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. Well, y`know I`m 29. I mean who needs a savings account. Oh, I don`t know. You mean with Casey. Or Casey. Could be Casey. Consider Casey. That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! I kissed Kathy. No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he`ll understand this? Oh, don`t say that! Don`t say that. That`s not true. Is it? Then why didn`t you tell me to do that?!! God!! What am I gonna do?! Why?! Why do I have to tell him?! Yeah, I know. Hey! Is that a real thing? Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something. It`s-it`s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually. Yeah. What? Oh uh, when? Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay? Yes, but I-I uh, don`t have too. Yeah? Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do. See uh, that`s-that`s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is. It`s me. I`m the other guy. Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and... No! No! No! I just kissed her. How is that worse?! Look, I`m sorry! But there`s nothing I can do, I think I`m in love with her! You`re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line. Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me! Probably because.... Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww! They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me. Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her. Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly? Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it. Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it. Her initials. Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase. Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start! Thanks. Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts. Well maybe you should put some ice on it. He's really picky about his patients. All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it. Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you. I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office. Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. Like? When was the last time you saw her wear it? Big dog? I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words. Hey Joe. Hey! I'm sorry! That... where are you going? Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back? What?! Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her? Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up! All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all! What? All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What? Sounds like a really bad idea to me. The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts! Air hole! Air hole!! How do ya do. What happened? What happened?! Gotcha! Sorry! Okay, okay, you got it! You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys! You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight. Absolutely! So? Yeah? Man, this is.... Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good. Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party? No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?! Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude! I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow! This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore! Oh man! I am so excited, I may vomit! Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there. It's not gonna be exactly like last time. Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then. He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago. Stupid, useless Canadian money! Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players. Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night! And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again? All right!! Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face? Well, those were seals, man. Yeah, all right. Actually, me too. Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud? Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! Oh, yeah! How did you meet her? Were you so late because you were burring this woman? How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany. Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight. All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it. Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling. Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up? Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer? Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss. Yes. I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm, I mean, No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay! See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up. Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel. Oh, by the way, that is her full name. Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure! Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!! Hello, children! Have I got the 50 guys for you! Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight? Wherever! I've got like 20! Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more. Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me? Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer. Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards. See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh? Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division. It's a big company, I don't, if you, I Oh yeah! With who? Yeah. Hey, man! Well, like father, like son. Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. Ummmmmmmm, no. Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get, oh I see. Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs? I'm not Jewish, so... Bad dream? Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about? Prague? I did! I absolutely did! I'm sure you're right, but why? Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry. I know! I know! Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once. Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right? Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me? Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth. Have you ever been with a woman? So there is no good time to ask that question. I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*. Well, you, you know what I meant. So what job did you get Joe? You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station? Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants. Yes. Right where? Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking. Oh, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level. No, he's right, I'm totally lying. Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey. No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him. Yes and I was saying the actual words. We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot. Yeah? All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden? Yes, yes, we had the sex. It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, "Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it." Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always... nice. But I need to know what makes it go from "nice" to "My God, somebody's killing her in there!" You don't have to draw an actual wo -- Woah, she' hot. There are seven? That's one? Oh, you know what, I was looking at it upside down. And that's bad? Well you might if it were anything like seven. You! Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion. Oh, I can uh, check that for ya. I can check that for ya. Well, we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers. And you, Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there. Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag. Stop that now! Yes! Diet soda. Orange juice. Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! I got it! Scotch tape. Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces. All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it. Fears and Pet Peeves. His legs flail about as if independent of his body! She has a real name. Althea?! What are you doing?! Are you sure it was Althea?! Nice shooting! Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong. Unfortunately that is correct. I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you. Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far? Say 200? All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds. But if we win, we get your apartment. Okay. Dangerous Liaisons. Oh! Fancy. Fancy guest. Thanks man. You can't just call Monica's room. Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice. Hey! Yeah, but I bet it works. Well believe it baby! I knew it! Cool, girl roommate. Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us! What?! What-what is it?! I can't believe we live here! Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play! I know!! Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she? Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?! Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it! I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!" All right, look, look, what am I gonna do? Really? So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? Yeah, I know but.... Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing. I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means! Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there! Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him. Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two! Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing. Well, you can understand, given how we started. Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this! Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon! Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy! I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here! Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's! Yes! See you and I have always been like, Did she call? All right, maybe I should call her. Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong? Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy? She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross! That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat. Oh my God!! Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset. Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me, Nick's pants? Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one! Well, she wasn't sleeping with him. She is now. I'm saying that she is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really. Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples! You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you. Would you give me one minute!! Please. Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants! That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers. They got a breakfast buffet. Ooh, let me talk to him! Well, can I just.... She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me! Ow! Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time. Okay, I'm going to go stand over there. So y'know, uh, when's he getting back? Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen. Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time. No you can't. You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long. Okay. No thanks, Mom! Ahh, come on! Y'know what, y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy. No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice Ohhh!! Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade! All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on. Yeah? Stripping! Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave. Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them. Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three! I am totally picturing you with all those women! Well, I'm there too! Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four! Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!! Come on, let me see that smile. Please? I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over. All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!" Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts. Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment! What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up! You said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here! That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya? Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? Hello! Isn't this amazing? Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. B-bye! Bye. I can't stand the woman! Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality. Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones! Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight. Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River. Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship. Right! I just think that this is happening too soon. I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas! No! No! Not, Paris. Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen! I don't know exactly. But I do know that it's some time tomorrow. Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack. Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not! Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow. I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her. Okay. Joey, trade lives with me! Thanks! Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport. Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then. Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket. What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with? No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card. American Express? Well, I-I guess I gotta go. Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel. Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. No! Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane! Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you? Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum. All right. Wouldn’t that be Frank the III? Hey! Do we have a baby name yet? Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid. Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him. Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot. Hey! And now you’re giving me the message! You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan? Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight. Raymond Chandler. Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco. Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey. Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name. Okay. No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name! Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name. I have no name. Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint. Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off? It’s Clint. It’s Clint! It’s Clint! Clint! Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John? All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse. Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women. So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson. Really?! Okay. Thanks. You wanna hug it out? Yay! Okay! Bye, Pheebs! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Your pants! Santa pants. Santa Claus’s pants. Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don’t belong here." Yeah we do! Are you serious? Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats! No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time. Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please? Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment. Oh my God! You do know that Wham broke up? Where is Emily? Man, didn’t she like just get here? Easy tiger. So what are you going to do? Are you serious? Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with! And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna have some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now. Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go. No thank you. Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon? Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats. Screw the Knicks! I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more. And the Knicks rule all. No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade. No! Op, op, I’m convinced! All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in. Okay! Fine, let’s do it. Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first That’s a low one! Why are you screaming and hugging? Yeah baby! Tickets please! That’s courtside baby! No they didn’t! Those were like the best seats ever. Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small. Oh. Oh, God! I KNOW!!! Open up! Open up! Open up! What the hell is going on?! We are switching back, right now! Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe? What? I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole, you stole it, our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now! Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us! Totally worth it! Good night. Okay! Oh, well, that’s great! Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!! Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you? Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here? Oh, okay, thanks. Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring! It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic! They don’t have those. Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over! Hey, all right! Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses. Wah-pah! Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah! That’s what I did. Wah-pah! All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store! It’s 6:00. Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool. What? Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings. Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this, Hey! Nothing. Yes he did. Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot! You’re coming on to the entire room! I’m Chandler. Hi. You mind if I.... So uh, what are you in for? What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep. Hello! Little ones. Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me. Because I’m cooler. Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl, Joey was unconscious. Plus, you look cool. Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened. Phoebe is, making people. And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge! No-no, not something stupid, something huge. Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep! We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest! Yeah baby! Yeah, well? Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all! Oh, well. Yeeeeahhhh. But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again! And I just want a million dollars! Uh-oh. She was not good. Not good. Uh-oh. Hello! Noo. I didn’t know that. See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden. This isn’t one of those uh, y’know "If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket. Oh, that's Ross's. Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? F-hah.... flennin.... I KNEW IT!!!! Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you? All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It’s almost as good as being there." Well, You could, but... probably just the one time. If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
