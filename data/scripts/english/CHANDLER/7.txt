Hey. Monica and I are engaged. Thanks. Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet. It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica. To Monica! So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986? Okay. Know what I mean? There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress. I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. Hey! You look great! You okay over there? Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody. Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me. Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19. Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear! Joe? Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right? Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to...I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t. There huh...hmm, there-there was an incident. It’s happened to you? Well, what’d you do? I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!! What?! Yes, you can pass for 19. Yes! Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31! Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris. We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la . Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can! Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away. It’s Paris, who knows we’re here! Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding! Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care! What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye! Ahh, third base. Why to save your dignity my man. Well, somebody should. How is that ever going to happen?! I don’t care, she slept with me. Thanks. Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding. Okay. What’s the matter honey? Already?! Oh, I got some thoughts on that. What in God’s name is that?! Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know. Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place? Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding? Okay. Centerpieces! Definitely roses. Well, I just think they’re a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice. Uh-huh! Oh yeah, I should probably call them. Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story. What a sweet story. Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood. Honey, it’s gonna be okay. Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married. Well, I have some. Well, close to... Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party. No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party. Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no. Yes, I am! Hey. Ehh. Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do. Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. Yeah. Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old. Sure you do. You sure? I love you so much. Oh yeah, totally! Hey, you guys! So, what do you think? Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. I got glasses! No I didn’t! No! Really? You didn’t think I used to wear glasses right? That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us... What we want honey. Dying people say the craziest things. Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they. Hey! How’s the boat?! Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that. Do you know what I was thinkin’? Nothing, I just like to go like this. Uh why, do you have a lecture? Then free as a bird. What’s up? Well, did-did you correct him? Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand. Does anybody know me?! Don’t worry about it Pheebs. An old cookie? We can’t accept this. ‘Cause it’s gross. Okay, we owe you a present. I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad. Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened. Guys? I know. Why do they put so much steam in there?! Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen? Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things. I don’t want him to tell this story for years. If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off! All right, I’m off to see your dad. Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face...And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little...I’m a little embarrassed about it. What did you do when they found out? So I guess we wear swimsuits in here! It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy. That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV. And say nothing? No-no-no-no. Hey! Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering? Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you. Oh no-no, I can’t do that. Okay. So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy. No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe’s secret? That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that? Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick! What about him? Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow! Hey. Oh it’s always nicer to hear than, "Aw crap! You again!" Hey. Oh yeah? Did you not understand the story? Hey! What’s up? Huh. No! Shhh! Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another! Du-ude! Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!" In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers! Ross came in forth and cried! Of course it is. Wow...whoa! Hey!!! That was you! You have no trouble telling time now right? Quick! What time is it?! Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets? Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that. Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with...all the guys in my office. Hey. Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!! What are you guys doing? Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist. No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this... I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture. Yeah, I’m not in that. All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going. How about those three pointers? And those guys were this close to lettin’ us play this time too. Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom. They have that on the napkins at the club. Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right? Dude that is so sad. Could I play? Okay. No, I am. I do? Okay. Aww! Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me? I can’t help it! Borrow money from me? Why is there jelly on your shoe? Hey! I’m right here! I’m still right here! Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me? Can you people not see me?! There I am! Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine. Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!! I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down... Yeah! Ahhh. Oh yeah, that looks good. Okay. I’m marrying her. Die Hard's still great! What’d you rent? Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again. Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch. That’s sweet. So uh, what did this woman look like? Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror? No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album. Well, let’s see... Okay uh, is that her? Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend. No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her. Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow.... I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..." Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad? Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me. Can you figure out what I’m doing? Who? Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?! What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago. Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with! Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me. It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later. Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight. You-you-you didn’t know that. Well, I guess my work here is done! As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do. I would really love it if could do both. What? What?! A hundred and forty-five pounds. Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15! Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different. You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back! Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you. I’d carry you around in my pocket. Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies. Come on! Why are we here?! The hot chicks? Wow that’s actually pretty cool. Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system. You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you? OH....MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you? Did she freak out? Right. You said no right? You said no right?! Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!! What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?! Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come. No! That was a lie! See how easy that was? Yes!! Yes!!! Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it. I say we go with Careless Whisper. Did she see us yet? Did she see us? Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious? No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever! Is that what you’re thinking about right now? Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight. Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not. Say again? Feelings, such strong feelings. I just wanted to show Monica your book. No, no, no. No-no-no. No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes. Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . Oh, okay, time's up! Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in vegetables, Joey? Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go. Oooh that may be a New World's record Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up! Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. Okay, but if you can't...no dinner! Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something. Which smells delicious! What? Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! Huh! Where is the dog?! Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! What is it doing here? Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! Really? Well, it still has to go, right? Okay, it's um... I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs. They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. Is there a puppy here? Okay, you are new! Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!! Here I am. How did you...know? Where's Monica? Why not? Well, I, I should go in there. Why not? This is ridiculous. Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? And that doesn't scare you? No, no he went for a walk. Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. Clunkers?! Oh my god! It is so good to see you! It's up to you. All right. You got it. You got Nevada twice. Yeah. Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. Okay. Okay. That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one. Hey! What are you guys doing? I’m sorry, who? But we don’t know the neighbors. Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved? Eh, somebody’s in a good mood! Well, either that or uh... Am not! Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please? 4:00 A.M. I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us. Mm! Night Gar’! Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic! Hey! So are you enjoying the bike? What happened? I’m just eating candy. Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker. What is the matter with you? Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud? Y’know what would work? Stop making candy! You mean they like you. Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you? What is going on? Joey! What are you doing? Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas. All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right? No not Candy Lady. All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it! You’re welcome. No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh...are you okay? Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple. ...betrothed couple. Hey! Pheebs? Skull? How long have we been home? Lovely! Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing? Why not? Hey! Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again? Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him. No reason, except...she...told...me. No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now. Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00. Is this because of the burrito thing? Give him money? It was a joke! Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money. Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. Okay. Had the money in the wrong hand. How do you know so much about this? Richard used to do it, didn't he? Mustached bastard... Excuse me... Ahh-hahaha! Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you. Hey Pheebs! If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway? Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Hey! Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man? What? You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho! You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! Why? But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly. Fine, I'll give the suit back. Santa? Really? Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa? Then it's okay! Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas! Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah? My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. That’s a plane! No, I’m not! Because it’s flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica! Monica! I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon? Sorry, I just...can’t sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like... What?! Ow! Shhhhhhhhh!!! I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep. It got interesting! Damn you Oprah! Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun! Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh? No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading. That’s correct. What? What? What? Yeah! You? Yeah? I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room. Do you know what just happened? No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep. Monica? I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right! Okay. Yeah! No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor. Hm-hmm, I told you! I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work. Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes... Do you wanna? Couldn’t I just say, "This is Ross?" Sorry! Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here! My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! Hey! Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore. Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year? That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?! Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair? I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine! Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it? I’m gettin’ my chair back! Joey you broke my chair!! I think I should get the chair! Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me! Well, where’s the logic in that?! So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing! What are you guys? Like a gang or something?! She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29. No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun. Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute! Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man. Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! Ohh! Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on. Hey-hey are you drunk? Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents! Yes! Yes!! Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk. Yeah, I’ll take care of it. Okay we have to do something about your breath. That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised. Okay. Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress. See? Here we go. Phil. Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine. Monica’s a little drunk. Go change! She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk. Monica’s wasted. Okay, will you just go help her change please! Okay, open ours next. Open ours next! For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card! No-no-no-no! That was the joke! No, because you’re not a grandmother! Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go. How are you feeling? Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone. Pheebs!! I think it’s necessary. What? Okay, here we go. Hey! How’d it go? Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds. Monica said wedding. Do you think you could get through a poem? Too? Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. That’s great! So great things are happening at work and in your personal life! Don’t do it. I think it’s the dying cat parade. Oh my God! Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half Scottish right?" Yes!! Why is your family Ross?! If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang. Well, I feel like a snack! Oh no thanks. I don’t like anything from my Scottish heritage. Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. We heard you play all the way from your apartment! That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while] we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. Because we hate them. We have heard you play. You mean the spitter? Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil. You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest? Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say "I do," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!" Yeah! Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us. We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva! No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together. Joe… Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else. Yeah you can do it. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Our minister… Okay. Should we call the spitter? Yeah. O-okay. See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us! No, not us… Us! See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories. Joe? Isn’t that what happened with you and the bridesmaid? And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight. But then later that night… Hey! Well I was… I wasn't exactly expecting company after… 9:15. Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya? Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight! You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out? But we don’t do that. How drunk are you? That’s the perfect amount! What? I know. Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers? Okay! It bodes well for me that speed impresses you. Yep! Count of three? Two! Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. Eh! Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… No! No! No! They’re in my bag over there. Uh, could you leave me one? Yeah. No I-I-I’m fine. What? Who did you originally want to hook up with? So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this? Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bridesmaid you’d be marrying him not me! I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up. Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay? Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk. It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you! Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding… How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first! That’s what you should say. When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say. I’d love it if you would do it. But those are the words! Those exact words! Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important. So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding? Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands! Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call? Do you want me to call? Staying out of the way. Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore. Smooth. So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet? Huh. Hey! Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay! Really? Right across the street? When’d you meet her? Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too! Hi! How’d it go? Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation? So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name of the girl you’re dating? Bye! Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! What are you guys talking about? But I love swing music! Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too. I don’t want to say. Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with. Hi, honey! I’m home! Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something? Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scaring me. So could you come out here please? Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great! Well then why can’t I see it? Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. Wow! You-you look…hideous. Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you have to return it? Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you! Okay! I thought you were gonna be gone all day. Oh totally! Pull my finger. Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big Kinda. They’re really big. What? No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating. Sleeping with somebody new: anxiety, panic, and, I’m afraid, even more sweating. I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives. Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink. Water! Water! Water! Hey! Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours… Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?! That’s me! Come on! Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. Hi! Nice to meet you! I’ll be right with you. I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something. Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding? This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins. Y’know I think we should invite them. Well this is just sad! Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice. You mean like for award shows? You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!" Okay, who wore those? Not bad. Who’s that? Pierce Brosnan? Are you serious? 007?! This is James Bond’s tux?! Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux! Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this? A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? What? You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux! So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special. Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?! Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you. That was pretty 007. Ross is Batman! Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond! Batman has a utility belt! Batman has the Batmobile! Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right? Actually, I don’t like martinis. Ooh, yum! I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight. Well, does that mean that you’re not going to be wearing yours? Let me try it on! Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What’s this? An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy! The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming. All right! I found one that fits! Whose is it? Whose is it? Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it? Do you realize you get louder each week? I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow. Right. So uh, have you written yours yet? Do you happen to know what I’m going to say? Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door. Monica, there are no words… There are no words! This should not be this hard! I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing! Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that. Okay. All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? There are seven?! That’s one? Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down. Monica… Yeah? You'll get one. All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. No, no, no. Uh, uh. Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! Nice try. Look, Monica… This is not going to work. You are so great! I love you! Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking! No I didn't! No I didn't! No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here? Well, what if all my stuff was here? Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying? Oh my God. Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought… Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me? I've had a very long, hard day. Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then. Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken. Hey Joe! Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke——Diet Coke. It happened in London. The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. No-no-no-no-no! You can't! Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!! Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? Phoebe knows about us! Ahh yes, the messers become the messees! Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here? Oh, you're-you're going? It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex. Not if I kiss you first. Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss. Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya! Because I'm in love with Monica!! Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica. Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet. Who are those people? What’s going on? So we both finished our vows. Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier. Okay, what do you guys think? You really like it? I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
