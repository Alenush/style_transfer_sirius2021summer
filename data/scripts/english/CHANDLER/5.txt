That's right. Oh no. Okay. Hey! You okay? Did he just say, he loves Fonzie? All right! Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing. Really? Male nurses? So they're going on dates? When? This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor? All right. Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are! Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around. Fine! Maybe I will too! So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it? Oh. Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night? All right. Very good. Bye, momi-moo. Yes! Oh God, kindergarten flashback. Okay, keep saying it! So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary. Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this. Really? Okay, so... Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay? Right! So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her? That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think? Ha-ha-ha- -enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux! Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs. Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him. Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. Really?! That's what you heard? You said that? Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog! Yes! Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question? If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard? Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. Yes! Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends. That's true! That's true! Hey, there he is! There he is! How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel! Hey! Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves. Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had. Why? What's your point? Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best. I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH-MY-GOD. Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex! Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on. Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves. All right, let's show them how it's done. Y'know that wasn't part of it? Nope. Hi! Uhh, 9. I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time. Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing. Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference. What's going on? Uh, hey! We're flipping Monica's mattress. Aww, man! Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?" Condoms? And condoms are the way to do that? I can't believe it! We're here! Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere. Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on! Oh dear God, they gave us glasses! Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! Okay, great. Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! What? Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming! Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun? Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? Do not speak ill of the dead. I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom. I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn." Damn Rollos! Hey. It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator. Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea. Monica. Okay, fine, $300. Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room! Hi! Okay, Ross is in the bathroom. Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together. Hey! Yes that was mine. Yes that would have made more sense. Hey! I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh? So, I guess this is over. Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime. Because of the weekend, we had a fight. So, this isn't over? Really? Okay. Great! We're in a relationship? Okay. Joey, can I talk to you for a second? Yes. Yes. It happened in London. The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. No-no-no-no-no! You can't! Fun's over! Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour? Sorry. Hello! Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up! Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence... You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. So you're really okay with this? Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum. Okay, what is in here? Rocks? So, rocks. Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. Well, I think it's very brave what you said. Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing? Uh, Ross? Yeah, we are so sorry. Hi! Oh yeah, there-there she is! Are you looking at naked tribe's women? That's a pig. Hey! What?! How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease? Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair! He thought you said gonad. Love what you've done with the place. Oh yeah! Oh, the tears are real. What are you doing? You built a fort didn't ya? Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was I hate this thing! Hello children! Okay. Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand? You mean this. All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him! Okay. No-no-no-no! Okay, so he's out of here. Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? Not even on page 7? What about that circled one? Yes, it is. There we go! Let's go quicker. Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub. Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks. It's a kitchen slash bathroom. We are bad people. Yes that was a nice place! Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag! What are we gonna do? About Ross! Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello? Ohhhhh! 98. 99. 100. Okay, go! Here we go! Here we go! Hey! You're kidding, no! Yeah! Yes! Ross, you have to stay! All right, buddy! Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? All right! Isn't this a woman's hat? That's sweet, Joey. Are you aware that you're still talking? No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me. It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family. Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?" It's exactly like it sounds. Arghhhhhh!! I'm over here big guy. You did look like an idiot. Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians. Okay. Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in. Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef. Emotional Knapsack? Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez. Dude, don't do that too me! No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister. I called you fat?! I don't even remember that! I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud! I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry. We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story! Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. Oh my God! You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body! Sorry! Sorry. Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year. Okay. Are you all right? What? Without my toe?! I need my toe! That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?! That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?! Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. I can't believe this. Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later. Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I’m happy all the time! Nice try. Look, Monica.... This is not going to work. You are so great! I love you! Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking! No I didn't! No I didn't! No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out. Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's! See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's! Yeah! All this lying has been hard on us too. Well, yeah actually. I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships. Help! Hi, Pheebs! I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool. Well, what did the police say? Ross, it's just a sandwich! Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay? Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie? What is going on here? Yeah. No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class. Oh...I don't know. Hey. You're naked in this picture! Ross? Which I may say, right now, is out of control. And you're okay with that? Oh no! No! No! No! All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this. Joey's a sex addict. Well let's...let's see what everybody thinks of that? Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict? Hello, Chandler Bing. Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It’s been six months! It’s not funny! Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! The British are coming? Ohh. Why? Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0. Okay, I'll stop. You wanna play? Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home. I'm intrigued. Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back. Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle? Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid...Op! Op! Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe! Well, why can't you do them tomorrow? Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? I paid for those tickets! Oh yeah! When did that happen to you?! Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging. Okay, bye! Oh my God!! I don't believe they're brother and sister. Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night! Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!! All right. What is up? No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted. Could I be more sorry. I'm sorry too. I am sorry, Ross. This took you all day?! We're very happy for you. We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know... Happy New Year! Do you want us to leave the room, or? That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths. I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now! Nice! Elizabeth Hornswoggle? Horn-swoggle. No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular. Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants! That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area. Oh come on!! Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? Oh my God! Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep. Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross,there was a phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! Sorry man. Did they teach you that in your anger management class? Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party. I know, I can do this. I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica. No, sir. What? Oh, that was my work laugh. Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too. Okay. Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet. Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet? Okay, good luck with that. Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game. Let them win one. You're not even giving them a chance! Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win! Oopsey, missed it! Long! Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. It was my racquet. If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night. Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight. Just a little bit of sugar. Oh, you get used to it. So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal? Oh. What? Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir. Well, I just... Really? I think I do! Thank you, Monica. Coffee in a fight! All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?! But we're not ready to tell yet! Man, she is really gullible. Okay. Why would I be mad? I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you. I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free! And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down...let's write it down! Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn! It's your timer. All right, then massage me up right nice! Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!! It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it! Good-bye muscles!! I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just...I didn't know what it was! Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth. And the bunny got away. And you're gonna make them all disappear. Done. Hey. Hey! Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani! Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine. Oh my God! And a date with a man! Yes, he is! I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww! Hey, is Rachel here? Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em. I don't like your massages. Okay, but now see you're crying! What? It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything. Okay, you give the worst massages in the world. Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you. Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes! Absolutely! Yeah! Hey man, how did the audition go? Oh my God! Oh, hey! Yeah umm, they're called wallets. And we're done with the chicken fried rice. Or we can do the actual telephone thing. Hello children! Hey. Really? Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay? Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything. What's going on? Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny. Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say. The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me. I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy. Ow! Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough. No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud! Well it's not flexed right now! Sure, I'll do it with ya. That new mountain bike? Your work makes me sad. Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!! Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? Are you serious? Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps...She knows! Joey! Phoebe knows about us! Oh man! Ahh yes, the messers become the messies! Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued. Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more. Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down! Really? Yes. Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her? How do you know?! At this?! Phoebe. Come on in. Sure. Me? No. You? So do I. I'm gonna put on some music. You look good. Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom? Oh, do you not want to? Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion. Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here? Oh, you're-you're going? It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex. Not if I kiss you first. Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss. Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya! Because I'm in love with Monica!! Love her! That's right, I LOVE HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica. And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing. Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet. Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! Oh, I'm going on the lamb. Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica. Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her. Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?! Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps. Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up. Sounds like a fun party. Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head. Wh-wh-why?! Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?! I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right? Okay. It's not different at all, is it? Hmm. Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. Yeah, I'm cool. Casual. I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually. What?! Well, you do want all that stuff, right? Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever! Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?! Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head! Well, I did not know that. It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable. By me? Monica. Just tell me what I need to do to make things right. Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again. Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here? I need to talk to you, it's urgent! Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. Monica... Will you marry me? I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this. I'm doing this because I'm sorry? No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife? Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now. Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. I didn't think I was! Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. Okay, how long is this going to go on. That's not funny. Hey! Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red? Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon? Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that. Hey! Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter. Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested. Hi, Joe. Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it. You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream? No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud. Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her? Well there you have it! Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it? Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom. Hey! Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so... Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!! Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now. Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot? Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like? Ooh, I do! I do! I do! He has a gun! Hey Monica, here's your broom back. Oh hey, how'd the interview go? So what happened? Well you coulda tried, not kissing him. Come on, Rach. I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is! So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun? Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you... Uh, yeah. Why? Ohh, so? Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat. That was amazing! That was amazing. No, you're the best. No, you're the best. Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean. Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee. Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it? No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous! Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?! So? Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about? Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now. Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. Yeah? Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship. Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out! Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back. You guys ready for the movies? Okay. Oh yes. Yes. Hi there! That. Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts? Unwilling to steal from work, interesting. Dude! That's my girlfriend! Weirder than watching his two moms make out? Yeah, it is the best. Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke. Yeah, I wanna go to babe. Ah sure. What's in 'em? Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water. Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done. Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one. Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked! Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked! I wish I had smoked for my career... Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good! I think you smell great! Great job with the cups, Pheebs! Awesome! There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck! Thank you! Thank you! Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch. Okay, great. I'll catch you guys later. Hey! Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George. Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert. Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut. Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting. Oh, okay. Here you go. Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first. Okay, bye! What? I was not flirting. Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all. You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. I was not flirting. I was not and oh God, shh! Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin? So, Joey on Law &amp; Order, you must be very proud! I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again. Happy Anniversary, 10 months! Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. The one that doesn't. Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you? Okay. If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference? Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you. You're welcome. What? Thank you for that! I was not flirting. Really?! So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time? Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am. Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women? Well, what is it? If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon? Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One. So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law &amp; Order? See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law &amp; Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area! Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women. Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!" It's true. Again true. All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way. Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small. Okay, hold on. Okay. If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem. Oh the humanity. More so than anything else. Almost over man. Why am I looking? You couldn't have at least changed your shirt. Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on! Hey! You ready? You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world. Let me see the earrings. They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what? Thanks for picking out the earrings man. Hey man, what's up? Yeah, yeah! Me too! Yeah. Well, I like danger. Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at night time. It is starting to get dark out there. Okay. But it is officially nighttime. Your tax dollars? Wow! That sandwich really does smell good. I can't smell your sandwich? Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich? Okay. Yeah. Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we? How do you figure that? Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay. Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors. Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down! Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that. What's going on? Uh, HELLO!! It was a car backfire! Who jumps at loud noises! Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. Oh my God! Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever... No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk. You dove in front of Ross! Ross! I do not hate Ross! What picture? Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me! When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line. From a bullet! Much sense?! So you risked your life, for a sandwich! So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me. Really?! Thanks. Oh-oi-ho, yeah! Hm-hmm. I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me. Before or after you were shot by your own troops? Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I? Okay. Hiya doin' pumpkin? Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast! Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! So, what are you gonna do? Me?! Why me? I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be. Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. Hey ladies! What are you in here for? Gary, I'm here to report a crime. It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me. Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! You mean scared. Scared? Happy? I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there! Were you're parents happy, or something? Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary. Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica! Yeah, you're right about that. Hi! Yes I did, and I think you should do it. He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady. I’m sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him. Hey Gar! Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours? All right, let me in. What? I'm not a dropper! It's throwing and catching! Oh! Oh! That's so hard. Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ. Yeah, you almost overreacted to something. Not fun anymore? Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out! Oh that is over! You guys wanna eat here? Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard! Okay, so Richard, Richard! What? How much did I love The King and I? You okay there man? Wow umm, calm down. Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like? You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?! Yeah, I know that means buddy! Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs. Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job? All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you? Thank you. Hey! Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? What? Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite? I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot? So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money? All right, bye-bye now! Okay! We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once. Yeah. Isn't that Ross's money? I don't know. Okay! Too dry. No! No! Yes. I also said, "Yes!" No! Ahhh!!! Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high. They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie! Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break. Oh, you don't want me on the trip? All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie. All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now! You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge. All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here. Hey! Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge! I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast. Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge. Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg? Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him! Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me? That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn... Really? Hey! Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him! Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person. Hey! No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person! Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week! Uh, what was that? Hey! I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler. Huh. Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow! Okay. Wow! Do we have to? Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there. Yeah, I think we should see other people. Yes. It's a great idea. Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary. Art lover! I said art lover. I don't know, I'm very tired. So it's pretty much the same Pheebs. Yeah, I guess it's a little better now. Happy plane-aversary. Can I give you a present now? Okay! Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this! How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out? Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever! What-what Richard thing? What Richard thing? I'm not mad. Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. Oh my God. Love your condoms my man. Why?! What happened?! No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody. No! Her boyfriend Richard! When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it! Thanks. Next time? There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again! That's so funny, because I think I just did! Fine with me! What are you talking... Really? Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary. Whoa! Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! Good luck! I see. What? What's an identical hand twin? Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror? How? Again I must go back to, how? Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe. No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea! No! That was Joey! Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard. Really? Okay. See you later Mon. What does it look like? I'm going home. Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life. Really?! Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing. Hey Pheebs! Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life! Okay, ah umm, ah, an 8. Ah, a 6? 8. 8! If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner! Noo! Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8. Two fours. Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place. Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about! Another hard 8. Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight. You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight. Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you. Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! What do you say? Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right! Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one? All right! Here it is! Here it is! It's a four. Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. Let's go! Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve. I don't think so. Here just...take this. No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress. Okay, one thing at a time. Hello! One marriage please! Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out? Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
