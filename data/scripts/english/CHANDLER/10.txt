You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
You're on!
He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Wow!
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Anything?
You do realise that's your brother?
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Okay Buckwheat!
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Bye!
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
You got it!
Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
Enunciate!
Hey!
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
What are you singing?
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Hit yourself in the tooth?
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
Really? What happened?
You can't move at all?
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
Some of these look a little frayed.
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
I think you know.
This is what I want to do.
There's a hair in my coffee.
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
That's great. Can I see the book?
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Hey, you must be Owen.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
You know how to use a compass?
You do? That's fantastic!
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
What?
I got nothing.
Where are Bill and Colleen?
We have to leave!!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
See? Intuitive!
Which technically now you should give back!
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
How can you be so confident?
Really? Like you have a routine?
Really?
You mean like this?
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Why...why?
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Hey Pheebs!
Who's Amanda?
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Hang on, she’s right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
I get pedicures!
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
How was your date with Joey?
You didn't like that?
You don't know!
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Well, aren't you a treat.
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
I see you later!
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
I know, what are we gonna do?
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Was that Emma? Is she up?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
To the bathroom!
What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
I'm begging you stop.
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Thats a bear.
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
They left.
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Ooh! That's my girl!
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Me too...
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
I was kidding.
No, not yet.
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
Let's do it, come on!
Thanks!
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
So excited about your letter!
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
That's where people make number two!!
I don’t... uh... understand.
On every word?
And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Word!
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
They loved it.
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
That sounds like fun.
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Hey honey!
Is Monica not here?
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Hey you guys.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
Joe...
Fine!
Work, Joe!
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
Hey Joe!
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
I'm sorry man.
Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
What!? Of course I did!
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
I watched it!
I did!
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
No!
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
What did I just say?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
He really is a chameleon.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Lying is wrong!
I'm a pretty little girl.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Hey!
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Little people?
What...? NO!
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
But you already gave all your money to charity!
I don’t think you can do that!
That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
What?
Of course it was!
RAT BASTARD!
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
You can't make this stuff up!
What the hell are you doing?
Well, we're not.
We don't have a code word.
Any room that isn't behind this couch!
You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
Ok!
What?
And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
I can explain... Joey...
Oh, that's really ok.
Wrong number?
That's great!
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
No, no! We made this decision together.
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Somebody is gonna pick us.
I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
"The Firm"?
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Tell me more.
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Oh my God!
Hmm, the game's at one.
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
They're out there!
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Ross' shirt is torn.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
Oh thank God!
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
The cranberries...?
He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
The floating heads do make a good point.
Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
A little late for that.
Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Can you ever feel your ears?
Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Come on guys, PUSH!
My cranberries!
Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
What's going on?
And?
Are you serious?
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
And so incorrect!
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Yes, but...
Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
You're gonna be great.
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Ok.
That's what our friends call us.
I don't think that's exactly...
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Yeah, wow.
No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Yeah, I did.
We are NOT signing those papers.
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
You have gotta stop!
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
I know..
oh, honey..
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
You're Jewish.
Hey.
The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Erica wait!
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
You still want that baby?
Seriously, answer faster!
It's like a giant hug.
Hello.
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Those are all really old!
Hi!
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
I don’t know. What do you think?
I do too.
I know.
I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Hey!
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Actually, we already found a house we love.
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
You know that's not the reason Joe.
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
If you win, we give up the birds.
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Dangerous Liaisons.
Fancy.
Fancy guest.
Thanks man.
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Hey.
I know.
No problem roomie.
Sure!
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Here, here!
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
I know.
That's okay, we understand.
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
We got the house.
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
We're growing up.
So who's gonna tell them?
Not it! Damn it!
You'll see.
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
What did I marry into?
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
I'm leaving you.
Who?
Did I go to this school?
Sure, nice.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Hey!
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Fresh!
Mint!
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
I said it first, bro.
Look, if you did...
Totally. I had sex in High school...
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Your hands are shaking.
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Oh really?
Oh really!?
ADRIENNE TURNER!!
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Really?
Aren't you...?
Right. So how're you doing?
Hi Monica.
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Hmm mmmhm..
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Not her!
Soo... you girls having fun?
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
So where are you applying to?
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Why?
You kissed her that night too?
Seriously, where did this happen?
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
What did I marry into?
Hey!
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Heh.
This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
Thank you.
I know, I hate being left out of things.
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
What happened?
M-Me-me-me!
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
You are going downer!
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
How's it going?
That's what I was doing too.
You too.
Me too.
I'm not supposed to tell you.
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
I'll tell you at the wedding.
So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
I'll do it.
Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Oh yeah!
Ready?
Okay.
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
You look beautiful.
That really was an incredible wedding.
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
So, where's Mike?
Hey.
Why are you wearing my apron?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
I'm so sorry...
Monica. Calm, self.
Why would you say that?
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
New York is awesome!
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
That's great.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
Hey! How was lunch?
Oh, really?
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
How do you know?
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Shovely Joe!
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
YOU NEVER DID IT!
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Mrs Hannigan?
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Damn it.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
That is a bad interview.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
To Ross!
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
What?
When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Hey.
Really? What changed your mind?
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
Excuse me?
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
How did the job stuff go?
That's great!
Hey!
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Where's your passport?
Well, it's not.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
We're taking a break!
Jumping on the bed?
No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
What the hell is this?
I didn't know Monica had these!
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Hey.
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Yes, Joe?
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
. Well played.
Uh, Rach?
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Pheebs!
I think these are yours.
Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Mine was a humdinger
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
You couldn't be cool.
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Monica's grandmother.
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
What?
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Oh my God!
Next time, can I say breathe?
Where are you going?
You can't leave me alone with her.
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Okay.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
Is it really that bad?
I'm okay.
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Wow!
It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Well, that's spongy.
I know. He has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
Okay.
How do you feel?
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
What do we do?
Twins! Twins!!
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Okay. Shhh...
Okay.
Okay!
She? It's a girl?
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Bye!
Have fun at church-camp!
I know! You ready to trade?
Okay.
We could trade later.
Hey.
Her name is Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
I love you.
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Alright.
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Okay, let's find these birds.
Well, that can't be good!
How?
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey, wait! The ball!
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
No... It's all glued together.
I don't know. Maybe.
I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Did that movie ever get made?
And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
What's the matter?
I understand.
I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Well, I can't do it either.
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
That was... Impressive.
Sorry about the table, man.
You gonna buy a new one?
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Wow, this is weird.
Where's Ross?
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Oh, okay.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Sure. Where?

How did the job stuff go? Or facing a bitch of a commute. My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.  Well, it makes me feel sad, but... I see. Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright. What do you think Pheebs? Yeah. You're kidding! Oh yeah? I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic. Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay. It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do? Sure. And yet I never run into Beyonce! Don't, don't! Why!? This can not be happening! The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers. That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!? Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out. Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"! Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too. The Hitlers will be so disappointed. Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here. Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. I never stopped loving you. Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein. Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing. Obviously. Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away. I understand. They're never coming down now.
