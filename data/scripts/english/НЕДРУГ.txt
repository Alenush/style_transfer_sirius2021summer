Oh, yeah. Had that dream. Can I get you some coffee? Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! It's, uh, it's Paul. Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey! I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her. That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch. Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh. No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation. Isn't there? Well, ever-ev-, ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. Sexually. It's okay. Two years. So you still think you, um, might want that fifth date? 'I, Joanie, take you, Charles, to be my lawful husband.' 'Do you take.' Morning. Good morning. Morning. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you. Okayyy! Hey, Monica! You had sex, didn't you? So? Who? Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. Well, she has issues. He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! So. Sorry. You look good too. A lesbian? Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh. I'm pregnant. Eeaagh! Oh! Yeah! Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste? Mmmm! Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she? They all had a thing for him. Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or. I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant. Well, they don't have to know that. Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's, easy. What that Rachel did to her life. We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding, but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar. Nothing! It's an expression. Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid, and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles. Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. And you knew about this?! Hi. Ross, you remember Susan. Ross. Dr. Oberman. She. Yes, and she's very supportive. Thanks. Ross? That opens my cervix. C'mon in. Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours. Huh?! So, how ya doin? Yeah, well. Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging. Be right there. Be back in a sec. Okay. Give me a 'for instance'. Marlon. if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. As in my grandmother. Julia. We agreed on Minnie. Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? Oh, that's great. Oh, I, uh I went to Aruba. No. I went with, uh. Now, this may hurt. Me?! No! I went with Mindy. Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. Careful! They haven't quite taken yet. Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. Me. Well, thank you for giving it back. Hello?! Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. No, I mean it's not Geller. No, actually, um, we talked about Helen WillickBunch. It's my baby too. Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! All right, you two, stop it! Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen WillickBunchGeller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? Yeah. Yeah. A little. Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back. Look at that. I know. Hey, Pheebs! Hi! Ohh. Ouch. Yeah. Yeah, excellent. Oh! Oh, God! Ohhh! Put it out! Oh, come on! Come on! Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy. Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! It's Alan. Hi. Hi, Alan. I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! Loved him! Yeah! He's great! Yeah! Yeah. What? Yeah. WE WON! Thank you! Yes! Hey, Weird Girl. Did you pick out the vowels? Saltines? What? Oh my God, there's really money in here. Weird Girl, what are you doing? No, no, I haI have to give you something. Would you like my tin-foil hat? Please, let me do something. Okay. Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel? See ya. Eww! Nooo! Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! No. Wait wait, we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through! Honey, you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. You're kidding. Oh my God. Oh! That was Lambchop! Oh, yeah! Right! Wow. Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. Yeah, well, I had a great time with you. I just can't stand your friends. Mmm. No no no! Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. Oh! Yeah! Hockey! Hockey! Hockey. Rachel? Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true! Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play. I know. I know! I'm a duplex. Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? And while we're on the subject of news. Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. When are you coming home? C'mon, this is us. Waitressing? Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies. Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied. Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there. Well, you'll have to wait your turn. Any minute now. Pizza guy. Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion? Wait, you're not 'G. Stephanopoulos'? Man, my dad's gonna kill me! Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead! Yeah, that sounds about right. No, pretty much just a towel. So you guys want me to take this back? Shut up! Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the -wowww. Hey, buddy. Oh, that's attractive. I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. No. No! No! Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal. Come on! You guys can pee standing up. We can? All right, I'm tryin' that. Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care. So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night! Not a one. Oh, right, right, shut up. Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it. No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note. You know, if you want, I'll do it with you. Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. ROSS: Tony? Oh, you're breaking up with Tony? Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know. Does anybody want anything else? What's the matter? Why so scrunchy? It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady. Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that. Did he give you that whole You're-not-up-to-this thing again? Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of You'll never make it on your own. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Hi, Joey. Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her. Are you gonna go over there? Joey. That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs. Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at laundorama. Who? Don't you have a laundry room in your building? Sure. Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now. Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob. Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what? We're just friends. What four of us? Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet. Oh, god help us. Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww! What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls. Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. Yuh-huh. Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear-do you want it to be dirty? Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? There you go. Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short? Which? You've never met Bob, have you? Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly. Hey, Joey. -horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. Where are they? Where are they? This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us. It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies. Eww, I don't wanna do that. Here we go. Ok, have a good break-up. Hey, Janice. Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day. Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please? We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping, and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you. What? What? What, did you get me there? I got you-these. Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet. Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want. That's great. Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte? No, no, I'm still working on mine. That's it? Yeah, it was really hard. Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. Ok, you weren't there. Comin' through. Move, move. Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine. Yeah, well, now you're kinda not. But I saved it. I put my basket on top. Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds. What? No suds, no save. Ok? Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine. Yeah, but, there were no suds. Well, you know, no suds, no save. Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it. That was amazing. I can't even send back soup. What's that? Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates? He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up? Brooklyn Heights. Cleveland. How, how did that happen? What? Yep. Pretty much. Huh, I never really noticed. Monica, Monica is great. I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific. Yeah, isn't he? It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight. You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed. Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity. Huh. That's nice. Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice. All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do. What uh-oh? Ross, what's the matter? Come on, show me. Oh, everything's pink. Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry! Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking, how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please? Oh my god. Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like, cocktails in Appalachia. Close? She's got her tongue in his ear. Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's-not really true, is it? Oh my god, what were you thinking? Oh! I'm outta here. Really? I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story. Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom,, boom. Ow! Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok? Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back. I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world. Oh my god. How many of those have you had? Oh, I don't know, a million? Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la. I'm fine. All right. I'm not fine. Here she comes. Wait here. Breathe. How do you do that? It's like a gift. We should always always break up together. Oh, I'd like that. Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way. I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart. Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it. Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules! Let go! All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it! Yes! Did you see that? I could not have done this without you. Are you sure? Oh, are you sure you're ok? Does it still hurt? What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this. Hi. Hey, how'd it go? We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. Oh, I'm sorry. Where's Chandler? Oh, he needed some time to grieve. I'm free! I'm free! Yeah! Yes? Yes, you said that. Chandler? Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard! Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard! Saw your head. Saw your head. Hey. Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I-. I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. All of a sudden we realised we were in Yemen. 'We' would be me and Rick. My husband. Ooooohhh. No. No, I'm still married. Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan. Mmmm. Ethan is my, boyfriend. What?! I suppose mainly sexual. Yeah! C'mon! Very clean! It looks great! Terrific! Uh-oh. Oh my God! Whoah! Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready? Lose the robe. That would work. Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it, water's working, and, action. And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing? No, that was clenching. I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling, water working, and action. and cut. What was that? Thank you. Oh my God, I'm late. Okay. Okay. Oh no, I have to. I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me. It's not Rick. No, it's-it's Andrew. He's, new. No, that's not exactly what I was. So what do you want? You have me! Whaddyou mean? Like, all of them? Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another, and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too. So, which one of the two guys will you listen to? Which one? Well, call me if you change your mind. Hey! Oh! Night. Hi Mom, it s Jill. Yeah I m fine, I m just stuck at the bank, at an ATM vestibule.

Well yeah! Oh God. I- just I thought Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now -okay, goodbye. Yeah! Right! Yes. Absolutely. A quality. The doctor says it's a matter of hours. Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. What's with your hair? What's different? Oh, maybe that's it. Not just restaurants, from our house. Mrs. Geller? What is going on?! What? What's going on? She may have died. She may have died? We're looking into it. This almost never happens! Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice! Sweetie, you think you can get in there? I was just thinking. When my time comes. Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea. I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch. Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'. I'd like that. Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um. Oh! Okay! Phew! I dunno, uh, you just have a-a. Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple. What? He's cute! Is Brian? Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league. No. You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one. You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. Wait! We need shoes! That's really a day shoe. Could we see something in a slimmer heel? No, it really should be burgundy. Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? Is everything all right, dear? It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream. God! Ross! Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. Sorry Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter. You were right. Whaddya got there? What's the score? Beautiful! Your grandmother would have hated this. No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'. Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is. Tell her what? I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. More wine, dear? Those earrings look really lovely on you. Actually they were Nana's. Now I'm depressed! Even more than I was. Hey, Chandler. It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you? I know. That's what I told her. Yeah. Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of, radar. Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. Yup, and waaay out of your league. Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got 100 advance in my salary? An advance? Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. Huh? No, she's at a faculty meeting. What's it look like? Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Yeah, yeah, all the time. But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. We did? Yeah, right. Get out. Really? You don't know what that means to me. Nothing. Yeah. Oh. I just remembered, I have to do something. Um, leave. Anytime you're ready. Just aim for the bump. So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want. Hi, how's it goin? I did. No, no that was the first. Keep singing! Keep singing! I felt it! That's so sweet. Oooh! Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy. Yeah, okay. Alright. Woooo! Yeah! No. No, that's that's okay. Noth I was I was just saying to my. Sorry, I wa I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my in my life. And then he said that you said you thought. Daryl Hannah. Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a. Hard quality. hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. Yuh. Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like, sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. Rrrreally. Now? Now? Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take this was a gift. Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop? Phoebe. Hi. No. Have you seen David? Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk. Minsk. It's in Russia. We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. January first. Hey! Hi! What-what're you doing here? It'd be even more exciting if we were going. Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!' Thank you, Max. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just you decide. Please. No, but I'm asking. No, but I can't. make the decision. Stay. It was Max's stuff. I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! Hi, I'm Sandy. Yeah. That's okay, right? Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. Yeah. There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera! Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he died about two hours ago. But III couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am! It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll I get to see him again. Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you. Wow. It won't be the same but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. No, I'm, not going to Minsk. Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you. Uh, ow. I'll never forget you. Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square. What? In twenty seconds it'll be midnight. Monica and Phoebe are walking to a newsstand. Nice hat. Thanks. Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one. Bona sera. Ah! Nora Bing! Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about? This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man. Shhh. I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken. Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going? Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate but I get to see my son, who I love. Awww! Y'know, don't take this wrong, II just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad. Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms. I am famished. What do I want. Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think? Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila. Who's doing shots? There y'go. Ross? Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book. Yeah, any messages for room 226? You okay there, slugger? What is with you tonight? Okay, thank you. It's the Italian HandLicker, isn't it. She's supposed to be with you. Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why? No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off. He's not a hero. You know who our hero is. No, it's you! No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy. You are gonna be fine, believe me. Ciao, bela. Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay. I feel good! Who are you? So, the Etch-aSketch is from you guys? Well,, thanks. So. I guess I'll see you around. Well, what do you want me to say? Alright, I'll call you. Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon? Alright, well, be good, I love you. O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid. Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now? You okay, kiddo? Alright. Mr. Geller. Nooo! Stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape. Ah, poke a nose, mmm. Mma, Mma, Mmaah. Hey hey, come on in! Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat. I'm pretty sure that it is. So, I got the results of the amnio today. Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh? Totally and completely healthy! Uh, that's our friend Tanya. Of course it's your friend Tanya. Don't you want to know about the sex? The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya, yaw. The sex of the baby, Ross. Do you want to know? Oh, hello Ross! So, so, did you hear? Oh, that's so. It really is do we know? Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be. Oh, hey hey, ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here! Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be? Mm-hmmm. It's a. No, no,no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. Well, thanks for the books. All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? Hello? We've got a couple change s in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu. Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum. Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe! Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh? Uh, I am, uh, being naked? I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows. Hey Phoebe! Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here? Oooohhh. Oooooo. Yeah, well. What about the birds? Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! Just one second! Score! Game! Come on. Ah ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. No, that's cold, that's cold, that's. Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye. Grazie. What? Yes, you're having a boy! What is it? We already knew that! Shut-out! That's pretty much it. But you tell it really well sweetie. OK, I'll miss you. Did I, did I miss something? You're, you're, you're so funny. He's really funny. I wouldn't wanna be there when, when the laughter stops. Huh. Just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. You know, that, you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance. I mean, hey, I just met you! I don't know you from Adam! Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty? It's textbook. Just for a couple of days. I got a job mid-town. I figure, I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on a ferry. I don't know this one. Hi. Hey. Hey, good to see you Roger. You too, sir. What happened to the, er, puppet guy? Oh. Oh. Er, excuse me. So, Ross, er, how's the wife? Home for two, eh? Er, Chandler, quick, say something funny! Gotta go. He he he, miss you too. I love you, but it's getting real late, now. Her name's Ronnie. She's a pet mortician. Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the Navy yard, and show you the big ships? Nah. It's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. Joe. You ever been in love? Then you haven't. You're burning your tomatoes! Joe. Your Dad's in love big time, and the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. Of course one of 'em's Ma! What's the matter with you? BZZZZZ. It's Phoebe, and Rog. I don't know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. Ha ha. I don't know. Maybe, maybe low self esteem, maybe, maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe. Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel like less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. That's tough, tough stuff. Come on Phoebes. If we're gonna catch that movie, we've got to get going. Phoebes! We're gonna be late, sweetie! Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, er, easy on those cookies, OK? Remember, they're just food. They're not love. Ah! No thanks, I'm just waiting for, er, Joey Tribiani. Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh my god! You're so much cuter than your pictures! I, I'm Ronnie. Cheese Nip? Now, you see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want them sort of laid out, like they're sleeping, BUT, occasionally, you get your person who wants them in a pose, like, er, chasin' their tail. Or, er, jumping to catch a Frisbee. That's a good one. Hey, Joe. Huh? Hi. Hey! Hey! Hello babe. Wha, wha, what are you doing here? Oh, er, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for the meeting. Thank you. Er. Look, I, er, I, I shouldn't have come. I, I, I better get going, I don't want to miss the last train. No, no, hon, I don't want you taking that thing this late. Oh, where am I going to stay? Here? We'll go to a hotel. Go to a hotel. No we won't. You're gonna keep an eye on us? Wow. He's strict. Thanks. You're, you're a good kid. What kind of change? I can't do that! Yea, but, this. Knock, knock. Hi. Er, yeah, er, Joey said I could use your shower, since, er, Chandler's in ours. Oh! I'm, er, Ronnie. Ronnie Rapalato. The mistress? Oh, thanks. Oh, like, er, five minutes. Hey. Good morning, dear. Hey Phoebes. We hate him! No. We hate him! Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. I came to give you this. And this. Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were. There's chicken in there, put it away! For god's sake, Joey. Really. Of course I knew. Your father is no James Bond! You should have heard some of his cover stories. I sleeping over at my accountants. I mean, what is that? Please. Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling. Always yelling. Nothing made him happy. Nothing made him happy. Nothing, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby. Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no harm, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself, that he's been attentive, he's been more loving, it's like every day is our anniversary. Well don't be! Because now everything is screwed up! I just want it the way it was. I know you did cookie, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her? That's sweet. Could I take her? What's wrong sweetie? Now, now, now, what's wrong, come on? Oh. They don't. What? Oh. Well, I'm not, I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. Actually, it's, it's quite, you know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of, co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house, with your stupid big cups, which I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're all, like, Oh, define me! Define me! Love me! I need love! Hey Phoebes! Ohhhh! No, no. Ahhhhh! Hello dear. Hi, Ross. Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice. She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab small off my hands. Will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please? Just us. Although, I have enjoyed the fact that uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. So, do we have the best friends or what? I will go for that drink. Each. Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened? Kiss me! Hi, Monica. This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall. Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? That's funny. Who are they? You mean they're lovers. Wow, uh, anything else I should know? Eww! Hello, funny Valentine. Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna! Well, um, for the past few years I've been working which is funny because, that wasn't even my major. Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. I thought they could. I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. I guess. Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. What do we got there? A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture-Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief! It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. You're our third call tonight. Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. I brought you something. I had them made special. That's fine. Mmm hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end. No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing. Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya. It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone. That could be it. Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny. Oh, I love you too. But. You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you. All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. Not her. We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then? I'll even let you ring the bell. You guys tell them you were married? No way! Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them! Rach, why does my swizzel stick have an eraser? Oh! That's why. I'm sorry! Chandler. Ms. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. Yeah. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Hey guys, guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know. Hey! Hey! Never mind. But it was going to be really good. What is it? So, it's a typical day at work. I'm putting in my numbers, and then big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. That's great! So. I quit. Why? Why? This was supposed to be a temp job! Uh, Chandler, you've been there for five years. If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. So was it a lot more money? It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.  the WENUS? Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term. Oh. That WENUS. I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client. Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef. Um, hi there. Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so. Yeah. I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant. Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for? Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu. Oh my God! Yeah, I know! Well, what do you think? Thanks, Phoeb. But I just don't see myself in a big white hat. OK. Hey Monica! Guess what! Can you see my nipples through this shirt? No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there. Where are you going, Mr. SuityMan? Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the a-gogo. Work counselor? Hey, you guys all know what you want to do. I don't! Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. Oh, I love my life, I love my life! Ooh! Brian's Song! The meeting with the guy went great? So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises. What are you going to make? Yummy noises. And Monica, what are you going to make? I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great! Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing, you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing, with the stuff? OK, I don't know. Who are you going out with? Oh, is this the bug lady? Bzzzz. I love you, Ross. So what are you guys going to do? And he's not speaking metaphorically. I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my. OK, try this salmon mousse. Is it better than the other salmon mousse? Yeah, well, is that better? My God! What happened to you? Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do I learn? You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation. That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that! Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing, something. Oh Chandler, I know, I know, oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt! Hey, maybe this'll cheer you up. Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche. Well, it is amouz-ing. Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?. OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Ten dollars an hour for what? Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out. Waitressing? Well, of course I thought of you! But, but. But, but? But, you see, it's just, this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a, professional waitress. Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics. You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche? Talk to me. No no no. Talk, dirty. Yes. Say something, hot. What? with? It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together. Again? Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?. Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?. Well, that's very generous, er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about. And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?. Look, Al, Al. I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! Well? Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. Look at this! Oh! You have a window! Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of. Oh look! That guy's peeing! OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. OK. This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment? Thank you Helen, that'll be all. Last time I do that, I promise. Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Who was that? Wendy bailed. I have no waitress. Oh, that's too bad. Bye bye. Ten dollars an hour. No. Twelve dollars an hour. Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around. You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you, twenty dollars an hour. Done. Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat? Hi Steve! Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl. This is Rachel. Yeah, OK. Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells. It's a lovely apartment. Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour? I was just being polite, but, alright. What's up? In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie. What? Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja? OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK. Is it dry in here? No. Let me get you some wine! Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce, with just a touch of mints, and, ginger. Well, slap my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic! I'm so glad you liked them! Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them! Oh, well, um, that's all there are of those. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. Excuse me? Can I help you with anything? You know, I don't know what I'm looking for. Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are, they're like a little corn envelope. You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite. Hey! SugarO's! You know, if you just wait another, six and a half minutes. Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this! No, we don't. Oh, OK. Oh, sorry. Why don't you just have a seat here? OK, give me the Gummi-bears. No. Give them to me. Alright, we'll share. No, give me the. Well then you can't have any. Man overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a SugarO, save yourself! That's it! Dinner is over! What? What? Why? Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet? Hey! You don't want to work for a guy like that. I know, it's just. I thought this was, you know, it. Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking. You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something? Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler? Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something, you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa. How's this? Eeeee! How about over here? Aaaaah! See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? No. What about this? Hi. Ok, will that be all? Yeah, um, I was over there, and then you said excuse me, hello miss, so now I'm here. Right, yeah, 'cause it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute. Yeah. Ok, great. I'm gonna be over here. No no no! Hi, we're the Rostins. I'm J. C, and he's Michael, and we're having a boy, and a girl. Good for you. Next? I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Susan is Carol's-? Life partner. Like lovers. Susan and I live together. Carol, not me. It's a little complicated. But we're fine. Nina Bookbinder is here to see you. Hi. You wanted to see me? Which is bad because-? Your-Excuse me? Oh, right. Gotcha. It won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your. WENUS. Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information. Oh, good. This'll be fun. All righty. We're gonna start with some basic first-stage breathing exercises, so Mommies, why don't you get on your backs, and coaches, you should be supporting Mommy's head. What? What? I am supposed to be the mommy? Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman. I will flip you for it. On your back, Mom. All right, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath. Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower. It's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in. It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies. Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department. Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone? Are you ok? What? What is this place? Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be? I think we have an answer. What's she doing here? This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home. Think she got fired at Riff's? No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept bringing swordfish. Are you gonna go. I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right. It looks like her. Um, excuse me. Hi, it's us. So, so you're here too? Your turn. We know what we want. All we want is two cafe lattes. And some biscotti cookies. Definitely her. Yeah. You're doing it again. I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep. I could have cats. Nina. Mr. Douglas. Cool tie. She's still here. You're kidding? She seems so. That's unbelievable. I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head. Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our last class. This is impossible. It's just impossible. What is, honey? What that woman did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in. That's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in. What do you know? No one's come up to you and said, Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it? Carol, Carol, please. Cleansing breath. I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives. I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross? Do you have a sec? I don't know. For the past couple of days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors. I am? Oh my god! You're amazing. Do you still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel? What? No. Oh. Yeah, um, may we help you? See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about. My god. You still have your Christmas lights up? Fill this out and bring it back to me. Why? You are an idiot. That's nice. Ok, uh, Monica? Hi, Rachel. I'm Dr. Mitchell. And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosin. Excuse me? Surprise! Surprise! I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd 'a' said get out of my office! I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea. No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about? 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can still do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that? Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg? Eat your fish. Here, we brought wine. And this is from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist? Monica, how's the ankle? So? So, they still seem normal. That's because they are normal. Ok, but you have to admit that every time we go out with women we meet at the hospital, it turns into. Would you relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this. This is a great place. How long have you lived here? So, Monica, what do you do? Good for you. This hummus is great. God bless the chickpea. Monica and Rachel's apartment. Just a minute. Rachel, it's your dad. Oh. Um, yeah, I'm just working. Uh-huh. Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh, it's a Judy Jetson thermos. Right. Oh, I got something for you too. Um, yeah, um, twin thing. Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over. Who? He is? Why? Right. Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad? Why, do you think he likes me? Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken? You have not changed. Mmm hmmm. You're that stupid. You know your insurance will cover that. You get that animal out of here. Excuse me. This hospital is for people. I'll take a look at him. Oh, thank you. Rachel. Hola, Joey. Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics? Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for. Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me.' Uh, yeah, why? Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them? Hey, guys. Hey. Hey, hi, ladies, uh, can I get you anything?: Did you bring the mail? Lots of responses.  Really?: Sure, we have scones left: OK, read them to me.  Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however, oh.  We have apple cinnamon.  OK. Dear Ms. Green, yeah, yeah, yeah. No. Wow! What?  Your Visa bill is huge! Give me that! You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again? Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing? little playthings with yarn? Could you want her more? Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening. Hi! How are you? OK. We're not-we're not saying anything. What? We were playing poker, alright. And then he did. Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us? Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play? Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of, you know, like, like, some kind of, y'know, like, alright, what is it? There just don't happen to be any women in our games. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse! Really. I mean, that's a typical guy response. No. But you could teach us. No. OK, so now we draw cards. So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight. Oh, good for you! Congratulations! OK Phoebs, how many do you want? OK, I just need two, the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs. Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! ROSS: No, no. Uh, no, see, uh, you-you can't do that. Oh, no no no no no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours. Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites. OOooooo! OK, so at this point, the dealer. Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes, big bucks. But. I'm ready, so, just deal. OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey, three, eight. Eight, three. Alright babe, deal the cards. Dammit, dammit, dammit!  Oh I see, so then, you were lying. About how good your cards were. A-ha! And, what is bluffing? Is it not another word for, lying? OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rach, Rach, we gotta settle. Settle what? The. Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so. Oh. Right. Hell no, we'll pay! OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready. And you know what? We want a rematch.  So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends. Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria? Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech?: When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy! Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. Ha. Ha, ha. What? Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. Please! I am not as bad as Ross. Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident? That was not an incident! II was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand. Oooooh: Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! You're kidding! Where? Where?  Sak's. Fifth. Avenue. Oh, Rachel! Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home. Well, what's the job? Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping, for a living! OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi! Is Tony Randall dead? No. I don't think so. Why? Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car. What? Oh my God! Really? No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something, everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap: Nice earrings. Thank y. Girls, sit down. Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it. Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? Hi! Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! Um, ok, the, the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? Noooo, the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and-oh, I went to camp with her cousin, and, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! That's great! That's wonderful! Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story. OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker. Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game, like, uh, I don't know. Pictionary? Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies? Yes, we should. I think we should. No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go. Alright. Alright, here's my 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed. Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie. Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever. Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon. Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy. OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker? Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker. Excuse me, where are you going? Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker? Oh no no no no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then. Alright, Cincinatti, no blinds, everybody ante. Yes!, or no. Your fly is open, Geller. You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? Hey, that's, that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'! Yeah. Um. I'm out. I'm in. Me too. Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I think-oh-that one was Ross's. Yes: Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it. And your fly's still open. Ha, I made you look. I couldn't be inner. Monica? Monica, in or out? I hate this game! OK Joey, your bet. Ross? Chandler? Couldn't be more out. Me too. Rachel. Uh, I will see you, and I'll raise you. What do you say, want to waste another buck? I'm not telling. No.! Get your hands out of there! No! Y'know, I've had dates like this. Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red, little veins popping out on your temple. Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants. Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. Hel-lo, Rachel Green.  Excuse me: It's about the job. Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly.

Oh, OK, five card draw, uh, jacks or better, nothing wild, everybody ante. Yes, we do. Alright, check. Call. I'm in. I see your fifty cents, and I raise you, five dollars. Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?  Loser? What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it? How many you want? Dealer takes two. What do you bet? OK, see your two, and I raise you twenty. See your twenty-five and uh, Monica, get my purse. Rachel, there's nothing in it. OK, then get me your purse. OK, here you go. Good luck.

Saw Regis Philbin once. You owe me a waffle. BZZZZZ. Animal Control. Somebody called about a monkey? Marcel? OK. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, er, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal? Oh my god, you are! And you're Rachel Green! Louisa Jeanette. Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in, in homeroom! You have no idea who I am, do you? Well. Maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say Morning Louisa or nice overalls? Nah. It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems. But you! What a bitch! I could, but I won't. If I find that monkey. He's mine! Hi. Can I help you? No. No. Haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? Of course. Taste this. Is there too much rum in here? Just a sec.

Come here Patty. Here monkey! Here monkey! Here monkey! Gotcha! That's my monkey. You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge. That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine. You can send it back whenever. No! Sorry Prom Queen. No! Rachel! I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle. Oh! Right! Yeah. Nooo, it wasn't. What's the matter? No, it was. It was very very good. Oh, way, way better than Mindy. Well, if you want, I'll just I'll just break it off. Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his. Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away. We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what. Hey, Dr. Farber. All right Miss Green, everything looks fine. Yep, I. I'm twelve, I'm not stupid. Hey! Hi! Hey, you. Um, we should really be sitting for this. Now I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my. Will you be my maid of honour? Oh that's so great! That's all! That's not all. Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in. Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been. Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of! Okay, okay, when Barry was engaged to you, he and I- kind. I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said. What do you mean? Oh no. No me, I am so sorry. Sure, sure. Come on, in. Hello, sweetheart. Uh, uh, what're'you, what're'you guys doing here? Both of you? Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy. I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always. You did it twice? Okay. Sweetheart, just gimme gimme another chance, Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency. Oh God. I'll be right there, Bernice. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him. Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the. I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope. Chandler? Hi. Hi. Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your. Listen uh, maybe we could get together later? You got it. G'bye, everybody. Bye. May I help you? You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there. People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight. Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. Aww. Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl? She's your partner. Hi. I'm Monica. Monana? You're kidding! II spent three years in Amsterdam. And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight. Hey. Monana was very brave. So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts. Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show. There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say? Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background. Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? II used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society? I thought that movie was so incredibly, boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back'. And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? Does he, uh, fight with other animals? Even if he were, cornered? Uh, how is he at handling small objects? How about a hammer, or a small blade? Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. He he he got in, he he got in to San Diego. You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. Hey. I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How how did you know I was here? That I was not expecting. Oh. Thanks. Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'. Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus? There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are. Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing. Really? Then why are you like that? You by the door. In or out? You in the back, you're getting it all wrong! This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A. Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might, touch thy cheek. That's fine, thank you. Next. Name? What? 'My scones.' I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place wher crimes happen. Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' You know, I just kept thinking: why do people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go. Okay. What? Yeah, I'd really like that. Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know. Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh, well I, I mean I haven't ever uh. Yeah? Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person. Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right? Wow! You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practise it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong. Oh. Huh! Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said. Oh, I'm a senior, in High School. I just had sex. Well, you never told me how old you were. I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'. -in love with you. Sorry. Who? Hey, Mon. Mon! Sorry. Hey. All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay I have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great. Then, what's the problem? Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky? No, don't say it. Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler. Hello, Mr. Bing. Loved your Stevie Wonder last night. Sure. No problem. She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here. We stopped at the gift shop. I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky. Let it go, Ross. I got an extra one. You want this? Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing? So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions? Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus. They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds. Swiss quartz, ha, ha. Am I allowed to drink anything. Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station. No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back. Thanks. It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's brother's ex-wife's obstetrician. Knick fan? Oh, boy, do they suck. Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat. The Celtics. Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You waah! There is no father. Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm oh! Ok. Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who? Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone. She's not much of a phone person. Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. Maybe you should. Oh, that is so not true. It isn't. Isn't! Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. You're gonna kill me! Count faster. It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie. Your son. Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. I got it. No, you don't. All right, that's it. I want both of you out. He started it! You did! I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. Now go! See what you did. OUT! Breathe, breathe, breathe. Oh, no. It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you? Breathe, breathe, breathe. How, how is this my fault? Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. You know what your problem is? You are so threatened by me. Yes. Help! Are they here yet? Ok. Ok. It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear. What're you gonna do, suck the door open? Help! I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone? No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me. No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do. I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you do what I do. It's like uh. Well, for instance, what do you do? Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, if I see one more cup of coffee. I'm gonna go check up on your friend. So how did you know I was even here? Your mom called me. So is this her? No, this is a loaner. I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. so, did you see who won the game? Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck. Yeah, they're not so bad. The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no Lesbian Lover Day. Where are they? All right, ten centimeters, here we go. All right, honey, time to start pushing. I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them. Oh, god. What do you see? Wait! You forgot your legs! Push, push! Where have you been? All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need-Excuse me, could I have this? All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go! Good luck! Out! All right, he's crowning. Here he comes. You're not helping! You're doing great, you're doing fine. Hello! What do you see? What do you see? Oh, look at that. What does he look like? Really? No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. I like Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? That's what we were off doing. Thanks. Yeah. Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy! Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut! Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over! Pardon? Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pfffft. Oh, yeah right, OK, including the waffles last week, you now owe me seventeen jillion dollars. And where's this money coming from? Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time. Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist! Alright, we got the plates, we got the buns. We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew. Men are here. Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. Ewww! Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late. So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone? Yeah? What does she think of your little science project? Man's got a point. Crazy bitch. Joey, we always know what you mean. Hey. Hey. How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last? Jeez, you say one thing, and. You're going to China? Oh, let me see! Yeah. Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am, the head. Aaaaaahhhh. Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun. Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the. So you do know who he is! Sorry. Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. Hey! Uh, let's see. Alvin. Simon. Theodore, no. Forget about her. Course there, they just call it food. I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.' Ooooh. OK, how does everybody like their burgers? Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up? So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her? Y'know, just be there for her. Think about it. OK, I'm guessing this is from. Well, thank you, Melanie. OK, this one right here is from me. OK, ah, it's light, it rattles, it's. Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! This one's from Joey, feels like a book. Thinks it's a book, feels like a book. And, it's a book! Oh, it's Dr. Seuss! There is a little child inside this man! Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. Who's this from? Oh, that's Ross's. Oh. Oh my God. He remembered. Remembered what? It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. I can't believe he did this. Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? ahem, um. Crystal duck. No, no, no, the, um, the. 'love' part? F-hah, flennin. Oh, my God. Oh, no no no no no. I mean, this is unbelievable. I know. This is really, really huge. No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again. OK, is there a mute button on this woman? I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea? No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just: W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me? Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. HHe's in China! No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes. What about the time difference? From here to the airport? Yes! You're never gonna make it! Rachel, what're you gonna say to him? III don't know. Well then maybe you shouldn't go. Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him. Here, look, alright, does this help? Noooo, look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I. I gotta. OK, I'll see you later. Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! Alright! Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me. Hi! Hi. May I see your boarding pass? Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. No, I know, but I--he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I, can I j-just. No no no! Federal regulations! OK, alright, OK, um, then could you please, uh, just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important. Alright. What's the message? Uh. I don't know. Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh. I have a message for you. What? It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.  Toby. Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze. Mmmmmm. Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey. I think I blacked out there for a minute! Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! MMe again? Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow. Oooh, I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you would be. I don't know, II guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you, you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean, you're practically a woman. Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh, do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn, so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out? I don't know. I don't know. I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back, and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. Sure. I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling, but I'm thinking, oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great. Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! Yeah, but, y'know, it's, it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. Another good point. No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's, you're committed. Huh? Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out? Why isn't it working out? I don't know, sometimes it doesn't. Is he not cute enough for you? No! Does he not make enough money? No, I'm just. Maybe there's someone else. Wha. Is there? Is there someone else? No! There is, there is noone else! Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? Hey, big. -spender. So how'd it go? The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. I didn't know you had another level. Hey, great skirt! Birthday present? Yeah. Oh, from who? From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me. Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27B? Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this-this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea. Oh, why? Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna. No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so. I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but. I'll be good. I promise. Who is it? It's me, Carl. C'mon up. Behind my brother's back?, is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not against environmental issues per se, it's just that guy! Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. So I'm thinking about you. So what? Well, he happens to be a very nice, guy. I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! Ross, it's too hard. Ross, you're like my best friend. If we broke up, and I lost you. Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? I don't know. I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. Wow. Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! Right! You're right! Heh, y'know? You know what? What? I forgot. I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so, if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do. I mean-I'm sorry. III gotta go. I'm sorry. But. Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! Oh, thanks, sweetie. Really? You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? Can't wait. Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like forget about her but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, Oh my god. So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. UhOh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been? Thank you. I'm from New York. Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. Oh my god. We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old, and this guy. Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. And then we've gotta get some sleep. Bon giorno tutti! I do Raquel. How long do you want the cuffs? I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam. I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andy McDowell's new haircut? Great! Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist. Sure. It did at first, but not anymore. As much as he needs. Rachel, do you have any muffins left? Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdales who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it? Great. Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy? Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man. I guess he doesn't know. Mornin'. Your territory, huh? No thanks. Hombre? Yeah. All right. You were saying? Oh, actually I sorta have plans. Ready, Annabelle? You bet. Maybe some other time? Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep. Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. Oh, I got that for him. How did we do? Why'd you freak out? My breast milk is gross? This should be fun. Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. Cantaloupe juice. Uh huh. You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. I heard ya. All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready? Ready. You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing! Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do? I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. My god, what happened? Sure. So. I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't. Oy. Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later. Hey. Ohhhhh! Yeah. You're doing it again. You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds. I could have birds. Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party. He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand. I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me. You never know. There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you. All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to the noisy girls in the apartment above mine. He didn't have any. All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two. Oh, my, god. Helloo! Hey, it's everybody. Yes, I am. Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now. Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun. Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see Philosopher wanted? Hi. Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here? Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. Hey, how, how did you do that? Huuh. Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. Huuh. You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. Woah. Where you goin'? See you later Rach. Phoebe! Hey. Ahh, look at you, you look great. Thanks. You always said I'd make it. I missed you. I'm gonna get changed. Um, now. Phoebs. What? Yeah? Hi. So is there like a story or do they just start doing it right, oh, never mind. Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce. Umm, actually, I'm getting married again. Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight. Yeah, I know, I. I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore. Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in. Her name's Debra. Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way. I'm, I'm still me. That saves us a conversation. What about Julie? Well, that could take a while. Well, in a nutshell. No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. I love you Phoebe. And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb. Mrs, Mrs. Gobb? No Cobb, as in cobb salad. OK, gook luck. Well, somebody got some last night. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had the nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? I got a little drunk and naked. Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. So, are we gonna get together or what? Great, I'll see you then. Hi, Julie! Hi. Yes? How did you-? Thanks. Are we ready to order? Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat. Do I dare ask? And for the gentleman? You'd think, wouldn't you?. Miss? And what will that be on the side of? And for you? Anything else? Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy. Oh, hi. Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. Eh. Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. It was just so awkward and bumpy. Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you? You used to be my babysitter. Good, good, I'm a lawyer now. Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage. Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band. How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad? Here's your check. That'll be 4.12. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night. Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute? F. Y. I. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie, something. She's supposed to be very good. Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around. Uh. Hello. Hello. And who is this little cutie pie? I assume we're talking about the baby now. I think my uterus just skipped a beat. I think it's great you guys are doing this. You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through? I, I don't know. You don't clean the cappuccino machine? Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine. Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction. No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. Hey, you. He's just adorable. So what are you guys out doing today? Oh, there's our stop. You guys live around here too? So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's? Where's your baby? Ben! Ben! Ben! Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring. Yeah. I'm Stephanie. All of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary. Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here? He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father. Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy! Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency. Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it! Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smel-ly cat. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. From the top? Ok. Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault. C'mon. Let her. Yeah. Sorry Phoebs. Hey. Yeah we figure it'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time. I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I ve gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am. I'm sorry? Um, maybe 15, 16 years. Um, cheers. Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she? Oh, that does sound. Ahh. Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend? Alright. Fruitflys? So would you like any dessert? No! No dessert, just a check, please. No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head. Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure. Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, I'm over you. Hang on. What. I'm talkin'! Alright, fine. I'll call you back. Good. Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting. Ross kissed me. Ohhhh. Hi, honey. Good. What? This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo. Mockolate. Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute. Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate. Yeah? No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F. D. A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you. But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the mockolate holiday. Aren't you going to swallow that? Yeah, isn't that great? Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested? Really? Hey. Ohhh. No! What? Doesn't matter. Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats. Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you? Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it? The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out. Hi, thanks for coming in again. It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called fishtachios. They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you? Oh, sorry. Hey. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hi Phoebe. Phoebs. Joey! Esther Livingston. Gone. Hi, Phoe. Oh, just updating the phonebook. Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come? Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation, another graduation, another graduation. Is it really your fa-I can't, well of course it is. Look, I. Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder. Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. Honey. Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him. Hey. C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going? Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin. I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived. He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab. Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab. Uhh, you said there was a party. Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese! Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back. No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday. No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right. Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared. So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe? Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya. Geller! Hey. Woah, hey, you've been working out, huh? Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon? Hey, do you need me to pick you up? No, I'm picking you up. OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go. Uh, public display of affection coming up, you can avert your eyes. See ya. Bye. See ya. Later. Whad'ya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish? Well, I would make them Belgian but the waffles are hard to get into that flask. Yeah, OK. OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this but, I don't know, I always made excuses about it like, uhh, 'I'm just a social drinker,' or 'C'mon, it's flag day.' I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. I am gonna try and quit drinking? Hhiii. Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh honey give me a break will ya. Ooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later. Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition? Joey, have you ever seen me estatic? Well, here it is. Oh, isn't Lori a doll? Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terriffic? Uh-huuh Uh-huuuuh. OK doll, talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her. Thanks. You wanna here something funny? There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village. I needed to buy a hammer the other night and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village. Oh yeah. See ya guys. Hi. OK, I'll just sit here and, uh, chat with your, uh, friend type, people. Hi. Are you a, uh, friend of Rachels? Actually I'm a, kind of a, you know a, date type thing, of Rachels. Yeah, I'm her date. Oh, you are the, uh, paleontologist. Periodontist. Ditto. Yeah. Can I get you something from the bar? If, if you want to drink it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it. So the light went out in my refrigerator. Disprosium. You could not be more wrong. You could try but you would not be successfull. I know what your problem is. Um-hum, you're jealous. You're jealous becuase I'm a real doctor. Hey, you listen. No, let me finish. Hi. Uh, can I talk to you a minute. This is really hard for me to say. Oh, no no, it's about you. I think you may have a drinking problem. Look, I am just not strong enoughto be in a co-dependant relationship right now, OK. Well anyway, I hope we can be friends. You too. Oohhhhh. Hey! All right! Hi. I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me. Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about? Oh. Hey. Hey, Julie! Um, oh, I don't know, I mean, it's definitely wierd not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he um. So how did everything go? Well, we've gotta go. Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. Uh, no, Susan and me. The other us. We're uh, we're getting married. Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to. Look I just thought that. Is your finger caught in that chair? Want us to go? Yes! Is she gonna be all right? There she is. Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun. Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten. Oh hello, Ross. So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you. Yes. Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello. You have some life here, sweetie. I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. Well, not just for you. I'm uh, considering leaving your father. Phoebe? Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting. Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear? You're saying, my wife is in you? Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything. Everything. Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. Worth a shot, huh? Look at this. Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office? This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex? The only man I've ever been with is your father. I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more. No. No. I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this. You didn't marry your Barry. I did. How's it going? Fine, whatever. Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do. You do? Of course I do. You're right. Of course you're right. We're back on. Thank you. Ross. You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life how 'bout we go get you a drink? Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options. How you doin'? You did a good thing today. You wanna dance? Come on. I'll let you lead. Oh, yeah! Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth. With MonkeyShine Beer. MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there. Alright! Hey. Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen. I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great. Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? It's Erica. Never mind, it's open. It's me. Hi. Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died. Ooohhh. Yeah. You OK? That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. Hi Phoebe. Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing? Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. Who's they? Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them, but I won't. No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor? Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore. Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. It's about your monkey. It's alive. I don't understand, why didn't you help that man? No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore? I should just be happy to be near you. Hey what? That was great, the kids loved you. And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth. You were incredible. How did you know there was a but? The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. Really? Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me? Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken. The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows? Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with. Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know. So, what is this information worth to you, my friend? Maybe. Hi Phoebe. You're the only one who can save her Drake. Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God. It's Erica. How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem? Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh? Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge. You told me I was the only one. Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this? How, how can you be here and there. Drake, what're you getting at? Is this true? Is all this true? Oh Hans. I'll never forget you Hans. The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs. No. Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs. I'm not saying you have to be Barney. Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth? She's here. C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. I'm sorry guys, closed set. Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper. Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh. Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all. In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard. Woah. Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set? The one in the director's chair. We've got a problem. Tell me. I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche. Is it bad? It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, JeanClaude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan. I'll talk to her. I hate actors. Excuse me. Uh, is your name Chandler? Chandler Bing? I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse. It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it. Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. Hi. You don't think I'm cute? You can tell her I think her friend is cute. OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? Oh that's me, I gotta go.

Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes. Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go. But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear? Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner. Could ya? Ow. Ow. Ow. How you doin there squirmy? I have nothing to do with casting. How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over? I want you right here, right now. Meet me in the bathroom. C'mon. Alright mister, let's see those panties. Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier? If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them. Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.

Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. Sure. Normally, I would not do it. 'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and. Hi. I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed. Goodbye. Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. Oh, no no no no no.

You gonna slice them up real nice? Aaaahhhh. Hi. Hi darling. Some of your old stuff. Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym. Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them. Oh, hi Rachel. Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear. Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii. Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. I'm Gail.

What're you gonna do? Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go? In the bank. There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this. Oh yeah we do. C'mon. Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica. Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is. Everybody smile. It is off. It's the off light. Right Ross? He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass. I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom. Jack, give me that. Talk to your son. Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux. Of course she would, you're a college man. Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out? Atta boy. No, no, no. C'mon kid, let's go. Ahh, are you hadsome. Let's show 'em. Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining, oh no. Bye. Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off? Press the button. Which one? Which button, Jack. The button, the button. Dance with him.

Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been? Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt. Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?' No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change. I'll survive. But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists. Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sheriff. See. OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses? Hey. Hey. I'm going to look into your eyes now. Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up, look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes. So, it's great to see ya. You too. Drops! Drops. Here, they're free. Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later. Hey, woah, hey, woah. Hey. Goodnight. Oh God, absolutely. Yep. Ya know, she's having another baby. No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. Yeah. Are we nuts here? I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you. So. Yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah, it sure does. No, no, there's no rush or anything. Pizza delivery. Hey. Oh hi kids. Hi darling. Oh thank you. Happy birthday. Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride? Well, you kids take the train in? No, Richard Burke gave them a ride. Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section. We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin. She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. Hey. Thanks. You want it? Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one. Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen. C'mon, tell us. Yeah, is she really 20. I am not telling you guys anything. C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends? Jack, would you let it go? Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You, you got your own little speedster. Guys. Seriously, it is not like that. Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche. Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me. How ya doin'? Really? I'm a hero. Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them. My parents are dead. I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright. Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you. Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support. Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one. I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city? I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon. I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo. Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her. Really. I tell you, I've never seen him this happy. So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model? Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds. Oh Jack stop. C'mon, it's my birthday. Who's drink can I freshen? Almost time for cake. What? Humm, really? Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he? Uhh, not that I know of. Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call? That - that's an idea. Oh? Oh? She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone? So, who's the mystery man? A real doctor? Well that's wonderful. I. It is Judy. Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW! Found it. It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item. That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city. You're the twinkie? She's not a twinkie. Oh please, a relationship. Really? Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday? When did I say that? No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running. Very tasteful. What're we looking at? That blue freckle? No. OK. What're you doing? Baywatch! OK Phoebe, you ready to try one? hey're your backup singers, beind you. Alrighty. From the top. Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here. Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out? Nice to meet ya.

You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat. You work and you work and you work on a boat. He always ridiculed my pottery classs. and you sand it and you varnish it. but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs. and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County. the scotch and the cigarettes. and the bansai's and the chiuaua. I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but. what the hell does she want with half a boat. Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side. Yeah. How 'bout that. I really can't say. I can't say. I'm sorry, but I can't say. I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight. Pleasure. Take care. Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together? Taxi. Who? Wow! Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later. Bye, Richard. I love you, too. Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out. Okay. Sure I do. Honey, you are in it. Oh, yeah! Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast. Like a hound? You really need the bassinet? Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start. Look I want you, now. Bye. Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun. Neither am I. All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you. Rachel! It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much. You told me you didn't see anything. I tell ya a lot things! Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear. Stay well. Rach! Rach! Oh my God, I'm married! I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber. Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now. Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of. insane. from the syphilis. Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on. Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry. Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel. What?! What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel. No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um? Okay, I'll do it. If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is. If I have to I'll, I'll do all again, I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P. T. A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team. Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will. But you're not. God. I love you. I guess we just keep dancing. OH. MY. GAWD! OH. MY. GOD! Did not, she did not wink at you. Huh. Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were. See, II think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss. What song was that, Pheebs? Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za. Hi Monica! Hey Mon! Oh my God, has she slept at all? No, it's been three nights in a row. Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call. Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that. Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey. Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me. Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer. I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up. III gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss. Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay. I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey. Nope, not this time. I'm not yanking you. Yeah, I know. She makes me happy. I'm not breaking up with her! God, look what I found in the drain. What?! It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this? It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. God, what is wrong with me. I need to get some Richard. Monica, you broke up with him for a reason. I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called! Maybe, because you told him not to. What are you the memory woman? Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute. Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do? Honey, I was wondering. Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform? Hmm. You remember not having sex in high school, right? Well honey, what about you? I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things? Come on you gotta have one! Ross, you know what. if you tell me, I might do it. Yeah. Oooh! Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that. Really! Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know. Did you ever do the-the Leia thing? Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh! Really! That-that great huh? No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya! Hi you guys! Mon. Hi! Hi. Why aren't you at work? Oh, they-they sent me home. Why? Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon. You really, really need to get some sleep, honey. I know I do. Hi. What? Oh, really, let me see, let me see. Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is. Hey! Of! You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say? No, Janice. You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice? Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh! Well, there you go. Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters. I want you to say that you like her! Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore! Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal. Okay, who are you talking to when you do that? Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff. Were both of those Joey? Not even with your best friend. That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are. Pretty much. Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol. Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place. Richard's living room, drinking wine. All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out! I'm sorry, but that's my happy place. Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything. All right, I'll try not to. Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky. Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake? All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees. I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine. All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook. Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee. So, I hear, you hate me! A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me. All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together. For Chandler! Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN! ' Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me. So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War. Monica, do you want us to take you home? Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. Umm, yeah. Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? We're not gonna talk about girth are we? Yeah, okay. Yeah! All right! You go first. Okay. Princess Leia in the gold bikini. I know! Okay. Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place. I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know. You don't know! You said. We're baack! What are you guys doing together? Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN! Really. I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. You still can't stand her can you? Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot. Well, I guess that's something. Okay. Oh God! Really? April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, SixtyOne, 4:30 A. M. on Tuesday, the United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon it is now under bombardment by. Hi, Dad, what are you doing here? Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars? I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad? Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. What makes you think that I might not be okay? I saw Richard. Oh. So, how are you doing? I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing? You don't wanna know. No, I really, really do. Well, he's doing terrible! Really! Worse than when he broke up with Barbara. You're not just saying that are you? No, the man is a mess. Was he crying? No. Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry? Maybe. I think so. Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What? Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here. Okay. Hey. Monica, it's Richard. Call me. Sorry Phoebe. Noo! NO! Nooo. Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone. You have two new messages. Ola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay. Oh, aaaah! Ola! Hello. Hello? Hi, this is Richard. You have three new messages. Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone. Your outgoing message has now been changed. Good-bye. Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on PreCretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written. Yes? What do you mean, your seat? But, you got up! But, you left the chair area. You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters. One more chance Ursula, please? Wh. Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus! I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones. Well thanks. Not really. Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here. Yeah, okay. Sorry. Noo. Hey, Phoebe. Hey Mon. Night-night Bing-a-ling. Here's my binoculars. These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun. Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it? It's about you. I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool. I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you. No. See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you. Hey. Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me off the bed! Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing. You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and. Oh, my. God. Phoebe? What are you doing? Were you following me? So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic. Uh-huh, I don't know. Monica and Rachel's: everyone is there and they are watching an info-mercial that stars Joey. Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries! Shhhh! Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open. And there is Kevin. There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000. Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton. Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment. Hey! He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it. He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret. So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business. This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it? So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight? Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper. Oh, you didn't have to do this. Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer. We should? I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay? You probably want us to move in together? Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and II should just, um. Uff. Ohh! Nooo! Go Joe! No, thank you. Chandler! What are you doing here? Are you being British?! Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me? Barley? What kind of party serves barley? Where is this party? Who's party is it? What woman?! Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?! What'd you do, dip it in sugar? I've literally never been this happy. Oh please God, let there be a song. 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with.' Ohhh! Ross! Oh, hi. How are you? Hi. Hey. Whoa! Whoa! Hey, how do you guys get anything done? Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. What? What, wait, you mean like this? Your not doing it. When's your birthday? I know a guy who's the 18th. October 25th. Melt stuff. Yeah. Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone? No, I wanna melt it. Yeah! G'night. Oh, excellent. Whoa! Big octopus. Hey, what kind of work do you do? You-you work at one of those massage parlors? Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea. You mean like watch? Well, I don't think this, y'know. Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there? Ow!Ow!Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow! She broke my arm. He touched my fanny. No, she touched mine first! That's my job! So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you? Ewww! What'd you think I was, a hooker? No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop. Fine. I don't like you! Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do? I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know. Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad. Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know. Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes. How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt. Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know. Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me. You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry. This? Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker. Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. All right! Um, coffee to go, please. Aren't you with that girl over there? I'm sorry. Yeah, for you. Is that the list? May I see it? Come on! I'm not on the list! It's laminated! Y'know it's ironic. because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you? Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid. I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies. What?! Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever, almost? Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool. Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star. I am so sorry. Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS. Oh, isn’t it exciting, I mean it’s like having a boyfriend for life. What? Rachel stop! You’re so bad! You’re disturbing my oboe practice. I could play the oboe! Who are you? Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate. I’m Chandler’s new roommate. III don’t think so. I could be Chandler’s new roommate. But, he told me over the phone. He told me in person. That’s weird. Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh! Rachel! Rachel! You missed the exit! My God, what were you thinking about? Awwww! What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife. Wait! Wait! I wanna see this.

What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat? Rust, is boat cancer, Ross. Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go. You kids ready? All right.

Monica bang! Okay. Wow! Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together. What? No, you were right, you were right. I mean, III've got to give my marriage another chance. I'm sorry. No, III gotta go. Honey, honey, people are looking. Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now. Good-bye Chandler Bing. Rachel has those in burgendy. 'I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.' 'Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh.' ' in you, my endless love.' 'My endless love.' Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww! We will. Yeah. What? Bunny! OneMississippi. TwoMississippi. ThreeMississippi. You are playing American football? I'm Dutch. I'm Margha. Hello, Chandler. Margha. Mar-gha. It is okay, if I stay and watch? Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there. Yes! Yeah. The game is over, we eat now? Oh, my. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Which do I like? Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler. I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose. I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one. I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye. OneMississippi! TwoMississippi! ThreeMississippi! Rachel? Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress? Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever. So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray. What if you put them here. They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.' It's all right. Sweetheart. Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five. So far, I've sold seventy-five. Five dollars a box. A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell. Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble? Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it. Yesss? You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole. What does that mean? I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away! I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way. I can still see you! And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there. Rachel? Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular. You would think. What?! Looks good. I'll take it. It's-it's-it's almost dead! II think I'm gonna look around a little bit more. I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg. You're a big scrud. Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud. All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice. Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good. Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871. Who's next? Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself. Merry Christmas! That's great! Hey! Excellent! Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once. Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this. Oh, I got it. Whoa, you are very beautiful. Oh. How's that coffee comin,' dear? I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy. I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh? Eh. Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound? Come on over here, sweetheart. I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome. I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah. Oh believe me, III've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus. Ah, just one other thing. I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested? Hey guys. Joey! Happy Birthday! Hey. What are we drinkin' over here. No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband. What 'cha doing? Oh! Woooo hoooo! Hey, Chandler! No! I did! Of course! It's her favorite. More of Grandma's teramisu. That dies with me. Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom. Just do it. Finally, I thought we'd never be alone.

Got 'em. Hello. Hey! So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other. What? Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me?

Well, you seem fine. You mean like exclusive friends? Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed. Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end. I know I couldn't. So. Ow! 'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know. beside meeeee-eeee-ee. Okay, my next song's called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way. Hey Phoebe. I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm. Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away. Home is Home Star stew. Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.

Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll, avoid the, pillleeeee. We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink. Wow, that's great. Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. What? Why not? You could make a ton of money. Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry. oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now. Your thinking about my leg aren't you? It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: 'How much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it. What's that? What's a nubbin? You have three nipples? Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave. Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay. Come here, come here.

That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up. I love Mark. Do you know Mark? Actually, that's our three hole punch. And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71. Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross. I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!' Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine? Oh! Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight. Boutros Boutros Gali. He says he was too. So I was wondering. Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So your a chef? Oh, really.

Hey, two beers. And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog, In seven languages. Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight. Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei? I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons. Uh, plate? Plate. Plate. Plate. Plate? Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here? What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay. Still no smile? Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan. Ameri-ccan. Everybody! Previously on Friends. Hey, what do you want to drink? Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay. Morning! Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get? But my apartment is so. Wait! Where’s my shoes? Do I know why we’re rushing? That’s so great for you guys! You must be so happy! Good luck, with your girlfriend. Is this about me taking your watch? I’m sorry, I do that. Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know. Oh, well I tell Issac everything. You dog! Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place. Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule. Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me. Yeah, we are. Yeah, we are. Okay, we’re not. But, we are. I can promise not to tell her again. Uh-huh. You did a bad thing! Very bad! Very, very bad. No. All right. But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too. I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to? Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow! Ohhhhh! Hey! Absolutely, yeah! Oh! No, not getting my bra! Oh, yeahhhhh! Hi! Hey, what are you doing here? Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home. He’s sleeping. Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary. It’s not that kind of anniversary. Sooo! Anyway. Oh God, Ross I am so sorry. Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night? Oh, great! Me too. Ah, Susan will be so pleased. No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something. Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends. Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. Look, III am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you. Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?! You slept with another woman? Hey! No! Come on! No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no. Ugh. Ross! Ahh, nooo! You’re a genius, Ross. Okay, I’ll pay you tomorrow. Okay, bye! Yeah, okay, bye. Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here. Okay, but only if you give me a drag. Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. Hi! Hi! How are you? Oh, well y'know, I would’ve called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn’t find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So. Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism. Well, we got into a fight ‘cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married. Oh, yeah! Wow! Oh, I knew you’d be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her? Do you? Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I’m gonna, I’m gonna get my ah, my fiancée man! Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight. Y'know it-it’s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all. Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class. And he was my best student. Yeah, she was my best teacher. Ohhh. Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away. I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right? Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us. Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter? You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman. Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out. Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you. Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you? Ho-ho, I will. No-no-no-no-no. No. What, you don’t think I know that? Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about. You don’t have it anymore? Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better? Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice. It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her. You can have it! It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it! All right, man! Oh my God, who died on this?! Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to. Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw. Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin. Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay. You have a Miss Monica Geller here. Uh, absolutely, yeah, send her in. Hi. Hang on a second. I’llI’ll talk to you in the morning. I’m sorry what? Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip. Umm, I’m still here. You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us. Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights. Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say? Why not? One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even. Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me! Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right? Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive. Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off. Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together. Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain! Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why! What? Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you? Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. Wait, y'know what, II came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go. Hi. Oh-no-no-no-no…. Hey, you like pizza? I know a great little place. You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza! Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that. That’s about 60 cents. You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. Hi Frank. Hi, Mrs. Knight. Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. III was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is? Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less. None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want. Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. Here you go. Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you’d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover. Hi! Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say. I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, II didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now. I dropped a cup. so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying. Yeah, it was. Hi! Hello! Oh. Joe. How’s it going? Hi. Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins? Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class. Where do I know you from? No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm? That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk! Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie. Hey! What like Pete Dakota? I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later. Okay. So ah, we on for tomorrow? Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy? Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice. I have a question about this scene. Yes? Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor. Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking. I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that. It doesn’t say that in the script. Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom? No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to. Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know. Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I sayI say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here! That’s okay. Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself. has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size. Hey, can I ask you something? Where are we? Just tell me the truth. Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago? Oh, yeah. I know that. But you’re not. Okay, good. Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘cause it’s not so bad. I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently. Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you wanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda depressing. And the man who made all this possible. Mr. Peter Becker. One second. Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy? You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow. Well, that was ah. Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night. Yeah? I’m probably gonna need those. Huh? Hmm? Umm. Kate? Yep. You ready to go? Yeah. Very nice. Very nice. So umm, I’ll see you tomorrow, huh? Hey! Hey, Rach! Hey. Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don’t work for me. Bing! That’s a great name. Me too. So ah, what’s wrong with him? Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone? Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it. Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do? Uh, uh, uh, I am here. I know that. Hello. Morning. Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy. I know! II’m a big fan of yours. I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Absolutely! Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft. Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something? Cool! II’ll see you then. All right, it’s time to act, my talking props. Hey! Uh-huh. Ooohhhh! Ahhhh! Chandler is fantastic! Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you? Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a good heart? Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. Isn’t this great?! Don’t spoil it. Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating. I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care? Do you? Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off. I’ve got no reason to stay. Stop! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I’ll see you in the morning. I can’t believe we go on in, in a week. Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs? You know! At the place I told you about last night? Oh, okay. I’ll see you tomorrow. G’night. Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh? Well umm, maybe if it had more heat. Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know? Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up. And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach! And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal. Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind. Did he call? Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called? Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women. Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why? Awkward? Why should he feel awkward? The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you? Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix that. Hi. About what? Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay? Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’mI’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you? Hi, Kate! Hi, Lauren. Hi, pig! Well, thanks again for lunch. It was, wasn’t it? Wasn’t it? You too. Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages? What? Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty. So. Rachel, I made you a cocoa. Are you all right? While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won’t live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead. Hi! Wow! Skates! Well. Yeah, sure, that’d be great. Ah, which ever is closest. So ask me what I did today. I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef. So? I mean have you thought about it? Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing? Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem. No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip. Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.

The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la, Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.

Yeah, come on in. So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong? You must be Ross. I am Guru Saj. Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I’ve attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let’s take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it’s a koondis! I don’t know, what’s a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I’ve got a save that oughta shrink that right up. Oh sure, we should see results. Whoa! Clearly not the way to go! We appear to have angered it. Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love. Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to. Oops. Well it’s gone. It got caught on my watch. Lights. Uh, romantic lights. So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about. Well ah, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life. And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now II have the most beautiful woman in the world. There’s one thing missing. It’s time for me to conquer the physical world. Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion. I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states! Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed. Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think? Hey. I was. I was passin’ by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it’s kinda cool seeing you up there. Whoa! Hey-hey! What’s going on here? Who is this guy? What?! What?! Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it’s okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive. Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break. Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven’t been going out that long. Come on, we haven’t even slept together yet. Huh. You haven’t? You have? II can’t believe this! You-you’ve slept with him?! Y'know Phoebe, I’m gonna make this real easy for you. You made him a candle light dinner in the park? Uh yeah, I can’t believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. Hello, I am Guru Saj-Whoa! That’s supposed to be a duck right? ‘Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league. Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat? Hey! I’m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded. Do you mind if we. Yeah, could you scooch? Yeah, move over just a little bit. Keep on scooching. Why? Why?! What’s wrong with me?! What’s the matter? I have a feelin’. I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist. How do you know? Well y'know, he’s got access. Yeah. Y'know it’s that feeling you get, y'know? Like when you go bowling and you know you’re in somebody else’s shoes? That’s the one. Why is this happening to me?! I don’t know, maybe it’s my wound. So it’s-it’s not heeled yet? No-no, it’s ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there’s the cream. Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else. What is it, Tim? It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife. Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?! Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you-Give me this thing all right! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada! No more! You are a bastard for doing this! Get away from me! Thomas, come back here! Ohh. Pete?! So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team. You! Chuckles! What’s your name? No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half? I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training? It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get! Monica! Hi honey. All right, on the table. Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter. I promise. Yeah. No! No boom-boom before big fight! Hi! I can show you an ID if you want? Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again. Thanks! You too. Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team. With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy! We never get smacked. Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me. I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall. Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing? There you go. From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr! And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbotttt! Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him. Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let’s get it on! Uh-oh. It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant You suck! What, look back? Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion? Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion. Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck. Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you. Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. Bing! You got those numbers for me? Oh, you forgot? Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy! Bing! Hmm. Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just, kiss my ass! Oh? Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay. Ha! Ahhhh! It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine. I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror. I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid. Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt. Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this. MonMonica? Could you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow. So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn’t have done it without ya. Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident. Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya? Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you? Now get on out of here, you! Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just. Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area. Oh! Oh! Ohh! All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out. Oh! Yeah! Yeah, we can! Shoot! I can't go, I have to work! Hey! Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there. Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back. Ahh, yes. You're Erwin's daughter?! Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I. Then you must be? Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank. Take it easy-if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or-sangria! I can make sangria! Oh. Oh no, II'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school. Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us. The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know II heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way. No, no! Noo! Yeah! Ohh! Woo-hooooo! Wooooo! Hey! Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train. What are you guys doing?! Cool! I'll catch up! Hey. Hey! How did everybody sleep? Us too. Hey, what happened to you? Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off. Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny. I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head. Really?! Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime. Yeah! Y'know what, I should do it. Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool. All right. Oh, no! No, no! Hey, everybody! Wow! You wanna touch it? Come on, touch it! Hey guys. So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean? Okay, I'll see you in a bit. G'night. I saw you break in! What are you doing here?! What?! All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, II sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth. But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother. Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and. Hey! You guys, the water's great. You should really go in. Okay, well g'night. Don't be too long. Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don't really know what happened with that. I'm your mother. Hi! Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned. Thanks a million. Okay, I'll see you in our room. So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened. Noo! No! It wasn't like that I. Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close. Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple. Well, we were. Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old? Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you. Wait! Hey! Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm. No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note. Hang on. Yeah. So how have you been doing? Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right? All right, hang on! NO! Come on! Ewwww! Ewwww! I'll go in a second, II just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up. No, I'm not done. III just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here? Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done. Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza. You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles. I knew it, wow! Ohh, so cute. I know. I'm mad at me too. Hey! Me too!

Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house? Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let me ask you one question.

And then we could double date! Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too. I like it. What? Rachel? I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day. Well, we kissed. III didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty. So umm, are we cool? I knew you'd understand. So, thank you for the delicious dinner. Hey. Can I borrow the keys to your apartment? Ahahaha, haha, yes I can, of course. Excuse me. Yeah! Um, would you like to come in? According to recent findings! Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi! My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat. What? I'd rather not.

No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. I'll be in in a minute. Um, thank you for the gift. No, I. I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book. The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it. Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese. Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find. You must really like. Joey, to go to all that trouble for him. Well. Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out. Yeah! Oh my God! Here you go. Great! Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch? So is Joey around? I uh, don t really have a preference. You? Oh. Oh, okay. So what did you do today? Oh, it looks great! Well, I could cut it. Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say? You have really great hair. Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck. Checking to see if it s even. Looks good. Hey. Oh no it s fine, don t worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it s okay. Yeah! I ll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go. I forgot my purse. No, I really did forget my purse. Horrible! No-no-no, the kiss was good. No, but that s bad! What?! Can you really do that? Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you. I m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try. Okay. Bye. No. Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, KRock for our 1,000 daily challenge. What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything. Oh my God, is it really that bad? I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there. Oh. I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy. Dr. Burke will see you know. Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now. Ready? Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen. I gotta tell you, you look great now. You're an excellent patient! Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days. If that helps you. I moved back here a couple of months ago. Uh. I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's. But we broke up. She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment. You're not wearing the patch yet. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Hi, Joey. What's. Where can I wash up? Thank you. Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit? Here, let me help. You-you have a very beautiful eye. Y'know II thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't. Oh, I totally agree. What? No-no really, was-was that not okay? Oh my God! It didn't remind you of. No, but it did! Didn't it?! Oh man! Oh. Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am. Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here? Chandler? Why not? What's going on? By being in a box? Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm. Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler. Yay! Woooo! Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me. Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons. Really? Well, in that case. That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face. You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job. No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing. Kidding! God, I feel wild today! Whoa-whoa-whoa! You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system. Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets. I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities. Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time! Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once! Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers. And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean. With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach? It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's. I want to talk to you about your review. Why? So you could hang up on me? Just give me a chance too. I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill! Well our service is not grossly incompetent. Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not! Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious. Lebanon. How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at. I thought it went very well. Rachel, please, don't make a scene. Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable! She's not making me uncomfortable. Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out. What?! What would make you think that? Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant. That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking. Oh, I must've said that after you left. That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department. You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow. Done! Sophie, get in here! Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. So you guys want coffees? Yeah! Yeah! Oh my goodness! You haven't heard! Joanna passed away last night. Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab. I know! I didn't realize that she was so close. No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later. No, I'm sorry. I have to go. Good morning! I sure did! I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef. Hey! Hey! I didn't think you were gay. I do now. Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious. Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel? Oh wow! I'm free for her! Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free! Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow? Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five? Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens. Yes! Hey! Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday. Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers. Because we can remember them. Well, sure, that too. Can't hear you! Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right? The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie! Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross! Ross! Ross! I don't speak English. Well, I don't know what to tell ya! You found that handle, did ya? Well that's not true. No. No, it's really good. Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal. I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee? Yes we are. So, coffee? Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia. I know! Well, what happened was, we were at the courthouse, and we were having lunch. We were having lunch. Yeah, and then, all of a sudden, we were like, We're here, we're having lunch, let's get married, right! Oh. Uh, yeah. We've been trying to get pregnant, uh, pretty much ever since we got engaged. We thought we'd get a jump on things. You know, no one's getting any younger. 'cause the thing is, uh, we're not able to, you know, uh, conceive, you know. We've tried everything we've seen a bunch of doctors. Yeah, and they say, they say that our only chance to have a baby is if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish, and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into. Nice, all right, yeah! Hey! Wow, that's great! Wow, that's great! Yeah. Mmmm, I love this tushie. Can I take it to work with me? Oh! Yeah, you should. Isn't the Mastadon from the Pliocene Epoch? It's open, come in. Hi. Oh, that's okay. It gave me time to, uh, finish glazing my nipples. No, I was working on my pottery. Y-yeah. Mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica. Hey! Okay! Well, thanks for coming out to see me. I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. I really don't think it's a very good idea Phoebe. Well, because, you'd be giving up a baby. And, uh, I don't know if there's anything I can say that can make you understand the pain of giving up a baby, so, um. No no, the puppy is for you. Well, yeah. But, only for three days. Well, you know, I realize that I don't have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything, but, um, er, Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important. I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies. And I only wish that I had someone there who had given up babies who could have told me how terrible it is to give up a baby. I just think it would be something that you would regret every day for the rest of your life. So, however hard it is for you to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. You mean Dr. Geller? Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there and only the people with the blue blazers sit over here. That's just the way it is. Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world - a world without lab coats or blazers. But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now. See that scientist with the glasses? He and I used to play together all the time in grade school. Hmph, but now. Oops, this is saved. Gift shop. Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here. I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me. I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear. I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real! I'm Scott. I have to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before leaving a room or my family will die. Hi! Hi. We were just in the neighbourhood, so. So we thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure. None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just going to be right over there drinking coffee. Who is this little guy? Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumor. You are so precious, I could just take you home. Are you serious? Oh, thanks. Oh! Oh! Thank you so much. You don't know what this means to us. Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry. Oh my God. What's going on? Phoebe. No, I know. I understand all that. It's just that was my puppy. Oh! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, thank you! Good-bye! Good luck! It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation. Well, okay, so what's now go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there. Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos. Um-hmm, five actually. We do five because that gives you a 25 chance that at least one will attach. Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there? Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine. Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right. Umm, it costs 16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time. No, I'm sorry. I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school. Yeah! Yes! Oh yeah! Ready? Yes! Ohhhh. YEAH! YES! Hi! Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present. Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test. So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question. Okay. Okay. MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY! Oh! Awwwww! Awwww! Hi! Hi! Sooo, you've been doing this long? No, you're my first. Put the money on the table. Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice. Is that an expensive blouse? If you want it to be. In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer. Hi, I'm Joshua. Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife, Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt. Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours. Rachel, you needed to speak to me? It's this way? Sorry. Hey you guys! Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight? Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit? It's a good play, isn't it? Clearly, I'm having sex with him? Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance? Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'mI'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?! Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face. I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up! What?! Hey! What do you think? Huh. Yeah? I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home. All right, thank you so much for all your help. Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it. Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits. Ah, that's okay, thanks. Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime. I'm sorry. Wow! That would be great. Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. Good morning. Hi! Hey. Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me. Yeah. Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen. Will you call him? Great! So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week? Oh! You know what I need? Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves. Also large? Okay. Rachel! Could I have a moment? II was wondering, my niece you see is in from London well Shropshire really but y'know well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, De Fladermouse, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening? Oh, good. Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much. So, Gloves? Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda I have to take off. But, I was curious do you have any plans for tonight? I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come? You're into hardcore S amp M right? Kidding! I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V. I. P list, okay? Look for me. I almost forget the tickets, didn't I? For you and Emily, tonight, De Fladermouse. I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors. Oh! God! Wow! Hello! Yes. Thank goodness. Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day. Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum. Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late. Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with, You. You? What? There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room. The one with Heston on it. Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club. Hello! Who's in there? Who in the hell are you? Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt. You're in this picture? Joey, right? Every actor at one time or another opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself. Listen to me! I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, God, I stink! Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?! Wait a minute! Take your pants. Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel. OH MY GAWD! Oh well, I'm divorced. Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony. I just came up to say, Hi! Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye. I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York. No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross. Hey, mate. How are ya man? So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy. Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert? Oh my God. I think you're right. Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning. Oh, Liam. We were playing rugby. In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want. Ross play rugby? I don't think so. Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here. So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers! Cheers! Oh boy, I just love to sing! Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be! Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time. Oh no! Where to? To-oo Paris? oo London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona? When? Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes. Hey there Ross! Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you? Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver. Okay, Chandler, come on! Oh! I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right? Okay. Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time. You don't say! Good luck, babe. Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on! Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in! Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving. On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane. One ticket to Yemen? I'm sorry sir, I don't understand. Are you travelling with a child? Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is 2,100 and we don't take library cards. What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay? I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him! That's just halftime, there's more of this. Right. Okay. Ross, they are killing you out there! All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you. No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain. Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. One swift kick and he'll back off. And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup. And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp. I don't care! You just get him! Hello darling. You were amazing out there. Oh my God! You really enjoyed yourself didn't you? I think you've got concussion. You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen. Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone? Oh. Well, I'll write you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen. Chandler? Chandler! No! No! I wanna see you take-off. Hey! My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting. They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It’s a joke. Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya. Buh-bye then. Hey! Okay! Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable. Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. Why not?! Y’know, they ruin it for everybody. Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night. Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce. No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know? Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that? Then uh, what’s-what’s this? Hello? Surprise! No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before! You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised! Hi! Oh, no thanks. You okay? You all right? Oh, but the party’s only just getting started! So why did you plan a party at the same time? But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties. Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you. Uhh, yeah, I think I’m going to take-off too. I’ll go. Yay! Ohh! Oh my God! But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit. Hey! Nice uh, costume. E! M! I! L! Y! Are you all right? Umm, that was really great, but II gotta take-off actually. Okay. Rachel is my girlfriend. So, this was uh, really fun. Need uh, need a little hand there. You really don’t seem like you do. That’s. Well, what was supposed to happen? Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, II don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you. No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you. Because II like you. Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated, a lot of this isn’t based on tonight. But. Okay uh, however. My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet. I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time. Hi. All those things I said about not being ready. No, they’re-they’re all true. But. Yeah. Ohhh, man! What in the name of hell? Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked. Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money. Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I’m sad. Oh no-no-no-no! Oh no-no-no! That’s it. Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births? No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats. Doctors are wrong all the time. Definitely. Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one. Oh-oh, Phoebe! Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors? Yes. Three babies? I finally got my band! We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family! Why would we be freaked? Oh. Right. No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop. Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job. No, Frank. Yeah, refrigerator college. Yeah. Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career and I love refrigerators! No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re gonna have three kids! And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money. This is the boarding call for Flight 009. Oh my God! What are you doing here? You are so sweet. Me too. This is the final boarding call for Flight 009. Well, that’ me. Here, have this. I’m only allowed one piece of carry on anyway. Oh. Thank you. Ross. It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else. I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross. What? I was going to call him, but. I’d really rather talk to him. I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is? Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but, I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you. Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you. I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello. Ross, I love you! Three. Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi! Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour. No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. Don’t get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby. You think about it. I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised? Ohh, it’s time to go. Well that’s ambitious. That’s Carol with your son! Ross!

I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay! Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right? I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here. Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me? Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen. Nice! Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me. Gary. Okay, so it's a date. Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out. Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff. Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up? Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts. You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half! Did you cut this couch in half? You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?! I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars. Congratulations! Ohh, that's great! We've lost visual contact with the suspect. Okay, now I've really have to go! I know, but it's my job, sweetheart! Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer. Bye-bye. Yes? No. I'm all alone. Daddy! Hi Rachel! Come on in. It's really nice to see you again. Oh Rachel, uhh. Just ah. Here let me. I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that. Yeah, I'm gonna say no. Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl. I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. No, II actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in. Jen. Sure! That would be nice. Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call. I'll see you later. I forgot my paper. Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that? That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped. Fair enough. Zelner. Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot. Um-hmm. Yes! So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you? Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so. Uh-huh. Hey guys! Hi! Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial! Good luck! Go get 'em! Hey, that kid looks familiar. Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that. So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think? Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them-I'm kidding. She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding! I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back? Rachel? Do you smoke? Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here? Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection. So anyway we really. Honey, we're just smoking all over you. Oh, sorry! No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line. Oh that's great! You are the best! I thought you didn't smoke. We get high. I'm kidding. Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition? Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much. Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two. Yeah. It's gonna be weird. Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking. Hi! So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink? Absolutely! Rachel didn't you just light that? I've actually been thinking about quitting lately. Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like. Tell me about it! It does sound appealing. Oh, I never could do it. Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit! My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding. Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room? Thanks. Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up. Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. Is there a problem? Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, Hmm, soup. Hmm, noodle soup. All right, let's try one. Okay. Let's do it again. COME ON! Y'know what? We need to move on. Uh-oh, busted! Yeah. That didn't work out. Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard! No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us. Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on! So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip. Surprise! Surprise! Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten. So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, Yeah, absolutely! Hi Chandler! Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy. It's uh, 27 dollars even. Hey, where's the chicken? Great. I'll see you later! Pizza delivery! Hi! One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's 12.15. What?! Oh. Thanks. Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money. I'm gonna try. No! Sam Waterston! No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One. Joey! Pizza! Caitlin! Caitlin! It's uh, 12.50. No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas. Yeah. What?! Well okay! Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go. Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me! Oh, is there a problem? Oh my God! That was flirting?! Wow! The guy with the gas?! Really?! I just, I thought Joey was there. Oh Joey! Joey, bravo! Hello! How are you? Okay! Really?! You? Well, it's kinda dangerous. Okay, you guys free tonight? Yeah! Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative. It's called the cherry. Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it? Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce? Yeah, you can't eat that in my car. Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye. This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home. It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that! Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here. Ross! Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye. You're messages have been erased. No. But that reminds me, sign this. Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off. Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?! Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him. Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did? Hey, anybody want to meet a hero? No, Joey! Wait! Hold on! Hi! Okay, go ahead. Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you. So you wanna get some dinner? Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood. All right. Bye! Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll? I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me. What do you, what do you think? Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay? I'll see you after work sweetie. No. Yeah! Hey Chandler, what are you doing here? Yeah? What's up? Sure. Okay. Yeah, II considered that. I just know it would make me happy. No, I mean happy. Chandler, what-what are you doing? I know! I can't wait! Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just. I wanna be around her as much as I can. So you know what I'm talking about, right? No, it's too soon for you guys. Hey Chandler. Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second? You look very pretty today. Here's the thing. Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward. Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards. Phoebe? I want you to move in with me. Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it. Uh-huh. Yeah. Really?! Hey! Hey! We have great news! Congratulations! Congrats! So am I! Okay, I'll see you at the station later. All right. Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah! Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights? Oh really? Nothing at all? Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post? In a minute. You-you checked today's Post? 'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights! Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, Yes but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you? Phoebe. Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox. Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just. I want you to be happy. Phoebe, you don't have to say that. Are you sure? Oh that's great! Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?! Eew! It's creepy looking! No, I hate cats. Wow! What an unusual cat! Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but. Okay, why not? What?! I thought you wanted to adopt your cat. Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. I just came for the red-velvet pillow. Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want. Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something? I really like waking up with you. That would be great! Wait, just a second. What?! That's terrible! I'm sorry! All right. Okay. I'm starving! Yeah! As long as we're here! All right, fine. Hi Rachel! I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine. Almost! But first, we gotta start. This is a glaucoma test. Sit down. But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye. Here we go. 1.2.3! Ready? 1.2. That's okay. 1.2! Y'know what? You're young you probably don't have glaucoma. Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new. Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months. And I'll fit you for a glass eye. Very good Monica! You know where they are. Why?! Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down. It's a money thing, we don't have any. No. It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out. I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya? Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani? These got left for ya. Okay! Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over! Would you mind doing a picture with us? Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. Miss? May I help you? Changing one hundred! Good luck sir. 13. Welcome to Las Vegas. Thank you! Enjoy your flight? Hope you had a nice flight. Which guy? I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom. Very busy. Excuse me? Do I know you? Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy. Nothing? I have to get back to. That's okay. Yay! 8! Yay! 8: Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy! Go! Come on! Roll! Roll-roll! It went under the table. I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair! What?! Also Monday. Hello! I won! That was my quarter! Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money. Is that true miss? What?! It was my quarter! Was it her quarter? Okay lady, you're out of here. I'm just taking you outside! A blackjack table, Joey is moving in to try and get his hand twin to join him in his evil plot to rule the world! Are you gonna play? You can't sit here if you're not gonna play. 14. Stop it! Please stop it! If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you! Didn't I just throw you out of here? Come on, lady! Please, please take him too. Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat. All right. NNo running in the chapel! In case you haven’t heard, Courteney Cox got married to David Arquette during hiatus and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. But David was a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For they’re all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette, and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman Arquette. I just wonder what the new sleeping arrangements are? Hey! Oh yeah! Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please. Eight! Easy eight. Morning! No! Yeah, y’know the license plate game? Wait! Wait! There is the train station! This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number. All right, see ya Pheebs. In case you’re wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names. I’ll finish that one for those of you who don’t know what they’re talking about. Where the towels are Hers and Hers and His, Three’s Company too! Yeah, that’s the theme song for Three’s Company. Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married. Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out. Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy. I am so attracted to him right now. You got married again. So that’s your second marriage in two years. Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened. I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage? Oh, that’s better then. I see. Have you considered therapy? There are a couple of forms to fill out. And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there. Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl. So I understand you’re looking for a place. Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment. I don’t know. Hi! Great! I can do that. Fight. String? Kitten? Oh that’d be great. Sure! Ohh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding! Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle! Really?! Oh well, no harm, no foul. All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control. Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town. Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the paleontology department here. Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture? Whenever you’re ready. Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less intense? Oh my God! That’s where you pick up the bag. No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag. No. You mean dying man? Hey Joey, we’re ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he’s going to be playing your son. Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, Take good care of your Momma son, that’s your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let’s do this. Scene 5, take 1. And Action! Cut! Alex, remember you’re supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time? Okay. All right, from the top. Scene 5, take 2. Take 36 is up! All right! Let’s try this again! You ready Joe? Uh sure. Action! Cut! Hello, is Ross there? Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try. What’s happening to your accent? Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years! Nice car! I love your car. I bet it’s fast. Yeah! Wow! Really! You got a place upstate? Well, I’ll see you later. Hey! That’s my car. What-what are you doing? But it’s my car! Listen, III don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys. I’m not coming back. I live upstate. Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment? So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user. Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin. That won’t be necessary. Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem. Is there, anything in this record that is actually true? Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce. You need to get out of my chambers. Would you like to spend the night in jail? Maybe because you’ve got the keys? Hi Joey. He has the most amazing Porsche under there! What?! Hey! Hi. Hi. Lecroix. Janine Lecroix. Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago. I'm a dancer. Well, I think I'll go and unpack. Sorry, there's just more room out here. Why don't you try to do. What's wrong? Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer. Hey Joey, I got some beer for you. Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one? Is there something wrong? Joey. Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that. No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you. I don't think so. I'm OK. What? and live forever as a machine! Yeah, I gotta go. Hey Joey. No, I just thought it was cute. Ohh. Like what? Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist. Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer. Well I just thought. It’s a curling iron. It’s clean. It’s dry. No no no no, it’s pot-pourri. You’re supposed to smell it. Uhh-huh. I didn’t read it. Yeah. Tell me everything. Hey. Hi Rachel. You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan? That’s not true? Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel. Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken. Hi Ralph. Hi Kim. Yeah, nothing happened. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife. And after that, what could I do except become a chef. And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant. You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk. After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know? I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit? Come on. I want to know. I’ve had a really good time tonight. You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date. Are you going to eat that bread? You make me laugh. Would you like to move over to the couch? Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little. Okay. Are those your teeth? Yes. They’re insanely white. What’s a matter with you? Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have. Oh, really? You expect me to believe. Hi Ralph. Hi Kim. Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true. Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there. Kenny the copyboy. Hey. What’s the matter? Are you upset? Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room. Okay. Sure. Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room? Hey. Hey guys! Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving? Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come. No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day. Okay. Hey! Hey! Hey! Happy Thanksgiving! Hello everybody! Hi! Hi! Oh yes of course, hello Chandler. No. Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living. Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point. My joke wasn’t funny. I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do? Okay. Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it. What’s the matter with him? I think he’s stoned again. Mmm. I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room. I’ll help you dial. Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today. What?! Yes. It was you? That’s alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’t supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me. And we kinda figured about the porch swing. Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again? What happened son? Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you’ve taken on Monica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say. You’re a wonderful human being. No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don’t know what I’m gonna do about the two of you! Well we left ours in Monica’s bedroom. Hey. Hey guys! I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve. Yeah, that’s what I said. Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of the party people. Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner? Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why. Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too? Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later! Bye! OK, everyone gather up. ‘Scuse us. Here’s what’s gonna happen. The music’s gonna start, you’re gonna dance, we’re gonna tape, you don’t look at the camera. Any questions? Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out. No, we never do that. We learned how to dance. Hey! You’re a good dancer! Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little. Like this. That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better. Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there. I don’t see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! Really, y’think so? I don’t. Okay, everybody hold! Next on the platforms are, you two! And. You two! She’s nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this! No I don’t think so. Look, are you dating this girl you came with? No, no. She’s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy! God! What are you, in second grade? Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that! Make sure you get this, they’re gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it’s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody’s excitement. Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner. What’s going on over here? What’s the matter with you? Get out of here! Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny. Three, Two, One! Cut! Okay, here’s where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that’s a wrap! Why? Joey. 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year. Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you. In the moment, yeah. Sure, New Year’s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait? Me neither. Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 I gotta go. I’m gonna be really late for dance class! Okay, now I’m really late. Bye. I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant. Oh that would be great! Can’t wait! How are we gonna get out of that one? I can’t handle two nights in a row with them. I don’t know, they’re just a little blah! Well y’know, he’s blah, she’s just she’s very loud for such a small person. No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y’know, not two nights in a row. Okay? Thank you. Monica! Chandler! I’m really-really sorry about tonight. I don’t know if Joey told you I just couldn’t get out of going to this play. I’m sorry. Have a great time. Bye. Aww! Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something. So we can go out again? Oh good. We have got to move! Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah. They said stuff to me too, y’know! Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized? I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’d really like it if we could be friends. Great. Me too. I’ll see you. Or I’ll hear you. Wait! Yeah. Here you go. Well, if you want, you can work here. Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want. Flexible hours. Hey. Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. I’d love an ice water. Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron. Hey, waiter. You did! No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed. That’s the whole part? Okay, I’ll see you in an hour. Oh, excuse me. I believed you were saving this seat for someone. For what? Huh? What? It’s my joke. Okay. He can have his job back. Hi! How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte? Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime? Ohh! Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister. Oh my God, Rachel! Hi! Daddy cut me off. And y’know what I said to him? I’m gonna hire a lawyer and I’m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I’m gonna cut you off! That he wouldn’t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he’s actually proud off. Okay, I bought a boat. Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend. Oh, that’s so great! Okay, I’m really gonna do this! I don’t know how to thank you guys. Yes. Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars. For all the free food you gave away. We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday. No! I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my Please, hire me sweater. And these are my, Don’t you want to rent me this apartment? pants. Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical! So who made her queen of the world? Hey! No! They did! Yeah, we went shopping! I’m sorry Rachel, I’m sorry. Right! But, I am sorry. She took all my stuff. That’s the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much! Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a Pashmina could be a rug! Shut up! I did not sound like that at all! Were you this cute in high school? No you stop! You stop! What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff! Amy! Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too! Sorry I’m late, what’s up? Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. How strong am I? Yeah. Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that? No! I mean he’s nice. He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? But he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date because you did. Me, not so much. Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish. You think so too? Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type. Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out. No! Y’know what Rachel? You’re right, y’know he has been really nice to me. Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too! What? You’re paying for that. You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today! You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins. Hi! This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think? Really?! It’s yours! Me too. Hey! Excuse me. Are you Phoebe Buffay? Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan. Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented. I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph! Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies. That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star. No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this! Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget. Hey! You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why! Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work. It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress. No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl! You asked him too?! Why?! I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross? You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him? Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense! Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do. Why are you so jealous of me? Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy! Who?! What?! Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool. Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places? Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around. Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? II mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it. I don’t want to talk about it. But you know what might really cheer me up? Seeing some more of your super-cool slides. Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand. Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend! Who is it? Hey! No I’m not. We’re still rolling! Let’s go Phoebe! Yeah, can I help you with something? Phoebe, come on! Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller. Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars. Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol! Oh great! So? All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel! And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you? Okay, see ya! This is an hour-long special episode. Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616. Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617. Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right! This is where the opening credits are, but they’re not the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel’s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they’re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn’t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world. Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. Yeah. Y’know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it’s a seed. Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut? Y’know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital. Okay. Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. What do you mean? Dad! Yay! Like what? I love that idea! Yeah, I heard it. You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go. Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady. Not so fast Wesley! Remoray! That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine! Hope! Hope! Drake! You’re not dying Hope, you’re gonna live a long, healthy life. With me. Oh Drake. This is where Part II begins, which means this is now episode 616. Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this! Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so. Oh, me too. Oh umm, y’know I think it would be better if we just save it. They have parasites? What people? So oysters, huh? Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases. Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay! I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some? Looks like it. I got it! Susan! Hi! Hey! Thank you so much for coming. Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Hello Ross. I love what you’ve done with this space. Thank you so much. You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend! Hey Pheebs! Call security. Pheebs, didn’t you get fired? Phoebe? What are you doing here? Well, you were fired. I told that guy who answered your phone. Uh, Phoebe you-you don’t have an office. Phoebe, listen. You lost 13 million dollars. Are you all right? What?! Take it easy. Hey Pheebs! How’s it going?! Wow! Well, welcome back! Joey! What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’re working? That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He’s complained about you three times! We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now. Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up. Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study. Sorry. We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good. DANGER! Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin’ a soda! I’m Joey! How are you doin’?! Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake? Another Minute Maid fiasco. Well, I’m not gonna talk because. Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani. But uh, this is a study for identical twins. But, you’re not identical twins. I love the way you look every night Chandler! That’s why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice! Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there. Thanks. Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them. Who? Me the attacker? Why? What?! Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?! My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart! You’re look for laughable. Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester! Professor Geller? I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class. Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation. Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime? Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over you’re not my teacher anymore. Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A. I’m kidding! Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms. Excuse me? So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay? Well uh, do either of you smoke? No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense? Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie. Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know III haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favour! No, no How you doing? Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first! Yeah! Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me! Who? Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me? Yes you did! What was it? Ohh that’s so sweet! Dr. Geller! Well, we determined the cause of the fire. No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks like a curling iron. Well someone does. It could’ve been a hair straightener. Ohhhh! Y’know uh, actually III should get going. Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you. I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better. Of course! Ohh, I’m sorry. What?! Anything! Anything! Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie? Uhh, I can’t. No, I have some turning 21 to do. What are you doing? Do you not want to be seen with me? Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave. Hi! Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class? You are so fired. They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’s against the rules. For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more. Wow! Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot. Yeah. Stop it! Shut the book! Hi! Hey! Hi! Oh hi! Hi! I’m the student. Oh, we’re not together. Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I’ll see you later? Okay! Bye Ross. Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir. Professor Geller? I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment? Making out in your office. What? Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you. Spring vacation. Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips. Professor Geller! You wanted to see me Professor Geller? Doorknob? Oh good. Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks. You are so adorable. Hi. Can I get you a cup of coffee? Here you go. Sure. Uh, no not really. Why? Excuse me? Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel. Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime. Okay! See you later! Yeah! I’ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y’know, blow off some steam. What? Ross, are you okay? It’s a bathing suit? Is that supportive? How are you? Hi. Hi. Maybe I should go! No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat! Y’know what Phoebe? This isn’t really worth the free massage. I’m a little embarrassed. Yes, Papaya Extract. I will. Yeah. Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30. Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us. Yeah! I’m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends. Oh hey! Here they are! Elizabeth! Hey! Uh-huh. Is it dirty? Don't, I like it dirty. So, uh, what are you going to do next? Are they, uh, firm? You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad? You gonna slice them up real nice? Aaaahhhh. Ohhh! It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. Well, it was quite large. IIIII had to throw most of it away. Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. Oh, my. God. Ow! Ow! Ow! Of course we’ll help! Yeah! We’ll be here! So uh, here’s your office set! Let’s get you into wardrobe for a fitting. I’m sorry, why don’t we do that right now? He’s right here. Joey Tribbiani, this is. This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C. H. E. E. S. E. I’ll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? C. H. E. E. S. E. is right here. Nice to meet you Mac! No. Why? I spent two years developing this machine, it’s absolutely state of the art. It can do this. This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. So Ross, what your problem? Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age? I don’t like you going out with my daughter Ross. Okay. Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute. Daddy! Fine! Two minutes. Go. 1 minute 50 seconds. I’m Irish. No, unfortunately Lizzie’s mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself. Ohh! I get that a lot. So uh, Monica is Ross’s sister. I had a sister. She passed away. Ohh! Oh, you don’t have to do that every time. A part of him did yes. I’m already here. Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere. No. Oh, here they are right here. Thanks for your help. Just call me Paul. Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay? Well, we were very young when we had her. Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to. I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born. Yes I did. Joe! I’m glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya! The thing is it’s kinda on the Q. T. The actor who has the part doesn’t know he might be fired. It’s the lead in a series, Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E. Uh-oh! Hi Ross. Yeah Ross it’s okay, it’s me, Mr. Stevens. Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, Joey! Joey! Bye Rach. I’ll call you later. Bye Ross. Don’t touch him! What a nice story! So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom. Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you’re not all bad. And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl. I beg your pardon? You have a son? Don’t worry about it, I just didn’t realize you were married. You two were married?! Hey Joey, I want to talk to you. Joey, Joey, III’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out. III saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah? I wish I could talk to her. Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone. Listen, II guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do. How to make the next one even shorter? Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives? Are you yelling at me?! Y’know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’s fine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m gonna go out with him anyway. Really?! Wow. What can I say? This doesn’t make me like you any better! Then we agree? Neither of us like Ross! I like Ross. The shipment never made it through Omaha? Great. Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her. Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore. Yes it does. I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired. Who are you? Show me in the table. Well, then it’s not on the wall yet. You can put the aisle over here, and put the wedding ceremony right over here. May I help you? Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry! I did. No! It don’t go up on the wall! Yes, it was very offensive to my people! Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains! That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes you bring us nothing! I’ve never seen it! Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s. Sure! Are you okay? What’s wrong? Well, whatever works for ya. Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.

I’m calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the BingGeller wedding at our facility, it is available. Can I help you? He’s not here right now. Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there. So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night? Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible! Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome. How much more homework do you have? Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out? What do you need from the car? Okay. Just relax. Just relax Paul, you’re doing great. She likes you. She. Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y’know why? Because you’re a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy.

Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel! No, let me explain! Fired! What? Ross, let me show you where the guest room is. Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti. Do you still work here? Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway. Hi honey. How are you? Hi Phoebe. Can’t complain. Come on. Hey! Ross! Good to see you too! Good. Bye! Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay? It was fine. I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress. Are you talking about having sex? Normal. Nope! That never happened to me! Nope. Okay. Okay. When I was six years old. I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year. It was horrible. They called me chicken boy. And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it. Oh, I couldn’t eat now. Chicken? Chicken boy! Can I help you? This ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side. Okay. Will you marry me? 8,600. Are you interested in this ring?! Okay, I can let it go at eight. How would you like to pay? Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful 5 bills. Here you go. A tad. Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring. I just sold it to that gentleman. Rachel? Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you? No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad. Hey Chandler? Would you. Would you hug me? That’s exactly what my dad used to say! Five more seconds. Joey! Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down! Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y’know what I wanted to be when I was that age? A surfer. I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know? No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams. What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me! Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. It’s just that, when those gates open, you. Hard to close ‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me. I would really like that. That was so good. Who is it? Do you know who at my office? Oh John! Great! It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me. You’re dying?! I don’t know. Let me see the ring. All right. Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I’m sorry. Nice to see you Rachel. So glad you brought someone. Well, I hope you’re gonna bid on some things Rachel. Ohh, nice choice. Good luck. Shut the door! Shut the door! The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us. No, it’s a water balloon fight! We started it! Who drank all the Kamikazes? Nobody! We put them in here! You want some?! Yeah, sure. Attack! Put your balloons down! You put your balloons down! You put your balloons down! Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300. And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping 20,000! Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani! Monica! Chandler! You too, you let uh, your hair grow long. Well, my nose got lonely. Hi, I’m Lisa. Oh, I’m sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date. You’re table’s ready sir. Oh. Good to see you guys. Or if you prefer, this table is available. That might be fun. Mr. Tribbiani. Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center. I think it was valued at 19,000 That’s good. Very good! And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in. Oh my God! It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed. That was me. That’s me. I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife would’ve killed me. It’s Pam. I don’t think she’d like that. I don’t think so dear. What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right! Ross! Wait! You suck! Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in? Come on in. Hi! Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef. Well, it was great seeing you the other night. No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you. I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did. Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you. I know this is crazy but am I too late? Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head! Working with blind kids. Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am. You are? Why? When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone. Hi. I didn’t ask. You wanna come in? Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. Drink? on the rocks with a twist? I remember. Uh, no! No! That’s art! If it bothers you I can put my art out. So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me? Oh really? Who is it? Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way? Ahh. Excuse me? Oh. Whew! Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache. I think that’s fair. It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh. I know. Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I’ll be here. Not smoking. Chandler. She’s not here and please come in. Okay, she was here, but she left. Well she said she had to think things over. Oh, hey look nothing happened. Well all right, one thing happened? Well I’m sorry. Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not. Well if it helps, it worked very well. You were gonna propose? No I don’t have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me. I know. I hate that! Hi, is uh Phoebe here? Ohh great. Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur? Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I’ll be back to pick him up in an hour. So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. I remember when we first got engaged. Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don’t know that happened. You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy! What?! They wanted a scary story! You tell her Jack, I can’t do it. We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house. We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself. Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie. We really do feel bad about this though. We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen. Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think he’d ever propose! We might still have some money, if your father didn’t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet. It seemed like such a simple idea. Stupid Jack, the word is stupid. All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler. Ah, yeah! Hey! No-wait-no-no! Have a seat son. Hey! I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer. They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we? Well, if we learned one thing today C. H. E. E. S. E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don’t mix. You can say that again Mac. Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius. Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00? Oh, that’s great! Ahhh! That’s right. What? No dear. It’s not. Thank you! Good meeting you. Hello? Actually, I’m here about the assistant job. Tag Jones. That’s it. That’s my whole name. I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh. It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn. Hey-hey-hey Joey! Good to see you again! It’s a different building. Why don’t we start right now! Here are the audition scenes. Why would you think that? Everybody has to audition. I’m sorry Joey that’s that’s the way it is. I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first. There is a plant in your office. Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume. Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody. Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. What? I am?! I can’t believe it! Rachel Green’s office. Nobody. I was just practicing. Hi! Rachel Green’s office. Phoebe! That’s a great name. Hey Rachel! Cute assistant! What’s his story? Is he. Joey Tribbiani! I’m surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey. I can’t help you Joey. This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless. It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes. Good morning. Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me? And cut! Do you have a minute? I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch by guys. Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay? But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay. I don’t think I should say. Okay. Well. I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe. I just did them. What? Yeah, I filled them out last night? Hey Rachel! Umm, is Tag here? Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight. Well, we’ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that. Oh no! Hey! Isn’t that Tag’s backpack. Great! That’s great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile? I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck. Hey uh, I don’t mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go? I know it’s really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and. Oh no! No! No! My God! No it’s. Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy! Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast? Sure. Uh, your door isn’t sound proof. Good morning. Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! Well kinda old, like 30. And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night. A little. How you doin’? Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me? Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel. Really? Good morning Rachel. Went out with Joey. No. We had a really good talk. I don’t think I’m gonna do that bar scene anymore. It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happier when. Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff. When I’m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend. Someone I can spoil, y’know? Uh-huh! Let me ask you something? Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone? And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right? All right then, it’s settled. I’m gettin’ back together with my ex-girlfriend. What? Oh hey! Good, you’re both here. We kinda need to talk. Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing. we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So. We’re gonna give it another try. I’m gonna work on that. I do know. We’re so sorry. Yeah, we’re gonna go. Excuse me, II couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying Chandler Bing? Huh, good luck! Die Hard! Oh! That’s nice. Hello Skidmark. That’s why you broke up with me? Hi! Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work on the door. You must be Rachel, I’m Erin. Hi. I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me? I’m so sorry! Sorry! She says it’s too dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it. OH. MY. GAWD! How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever! Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I’m blind! So, who’s the lucky guy? Hey! Hey Joey! Ohh, listen. I’ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks! Bye Joey. Last night was fun. Or I’ll call you! Bye. Hey! Joey. Hey Rachel. What’s wrong? A birthday party. Allison’s birthday party. 32. Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift. How can I help you? We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you. Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up! Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours. I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding? Oh wait you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red? What about Benitez? What about shut up? Okay. Uh, okay. Look, he’s a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don’t see this having a future. Kinda. I’m sorry I. It’s just there’s no real spark. Yeah. I really don’t think he does. And y’know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y’know, tell him I’mI’m not interested in a serious relationship or something. Yeah! That would be great! I’m sorry? Yeah, let’s go. Bye guys. Yeah, we were we were just looking around. Uhh. Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist. I’m sorry, who are you? Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh. Wait! Did you write this? Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought. You’re.you’re so young. Oh no, yeah. Chandler? Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family. Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do. Do you have any tissues? Okay! Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath. Why not? Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. Do you hear that? Why? He does? Oh my. Gawd, II understand. II am so sorry, I’ll go. Good-bye Monica, I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper. Shhhh! I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good. We kinda broke up this morning. Yeah, so she went back to Ohio. Why? What? You don't like puppies? Hey. Not bad. Thanks. A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. Yeah. It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling? Why? You have all the answers, don't you? Hey, thanks for talking to me. What? What did Joey say? I like you back? Wait-wait a minute that doesn't make any sense. Wow. Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! Right there! That's my car! Hey! I can't believe this! I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. Thanks for having me over, you guys. Colorado. Okay. Um, I'm not. No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. I’m ready! Uh-huh! Thanks daddy. Yes, at 4:00. I’d better get back to my desk. My what? Are you serious? My name is Gary, I live upstairs. Hi! It’s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven. So, can I get some candy? Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building? Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you! No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources. A joke they would appreciate? What did you say?! No, not my touchie. Hi! I’m sorry, I know it’s after hours but I really need candy. Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy! I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable! Please, can’t you help me out? Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me! Yeah, that’s her. Thank you. That’s kinda sad. Got it! Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute? Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you. Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two? Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy. Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that evaluation. Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny. You wrote that you have a cute touchie? Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda strangely proud of my butt. It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can’t figure out what this is? Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you’ve got my fax number. No, don’t worry about it. Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work. Y’know what? I feel great. In fact! What? Oh, I’m sorry. We’re waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy! We want candy! We want candy now! Candy Lady? Hi! Hey! Ohh! That's great! Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes. I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir. Of course, sir. No. Christmas. Christmas eve. Santa has reindeers that can fly! Jingle bells, jingle bells. Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer. When is Santa coming? No Santa? Was I bad? Santa's mad at me. So Santa's coming? Good evening. Tequila! Here you go. Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants? Oh. Okay! How can I help you? Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man. Texas? Wow! Thanks! Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm partJewish. Cool! Santa! Did you bring me any presents, Santa? No! Why does he have to go? No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa! Okay, Santa! Eight whole days. Awesome! Oh my God! Phoebe? Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal! Yeah. Well II got like thirty of them. Umm, look III got a confession to make. Uh, III was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know II was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but II really wanted to see you and but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me. Really? Because I think about you all the time. I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk. That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles. Umm, anyway. Do you want to have dinner tonight? Oh. Uh, what? Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm. Hi! Oh, I used to work with Frannie. We went to college with both of them and now we live next door. Hey! Are you guys ready? Okay. And for you sir? It’s uh, it’s already been roasted. Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli. Any progress? Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. IIII didn’t think you were coming. Well, I’m very glad you’re here. Ross, sweetheart! Isn’t it a beautiful wedding?! Monica! What. I believe you know my husband. Oh, I hate this but III have to go. II can’t miss my flight. July. Umm, Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much. Yeah, I. Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I have to leave. II do though. Bye Phoebe. Hi sweetie! Are you leaving? Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on! Oh no! Oh no! Okay! Okay! Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here. What? Beep! Sure. If this is your idea of sexy talk? What contracts? Like what? Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts! I’m telling you, you never gave them to me. No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk! You wanna go down to the office right now? Okay I understand. I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either. Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk. It’s my sister. So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon? It’s not here. How could I have left them in the copy room? Fine. Still no luck. Do you want me to check again? Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office? Any luck? Yeah? You found them! Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m just really relived this whole thing is over. I did not! How did you know they were in my bottom drawer? Phoebe Buffay?! We found your fire alarm in the trash chute. Yes it is. The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica. Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them. There’s a reset button under the plastic cover. So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can. Why don’t we do a trial run. I’m the supply manager. We don’t need any toner. Okay, what was wrong with that call? They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script. So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions? I’m here! Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore. Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic. So, I think your boxes are over here. I don’t know. They-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her. I’ll throw these away. Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit! Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh. Y’know how the garage floods every Spring? I think I accidentally used Monica’s boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche. You don’t secretly smoke do you? So it’s just your mother then. I don’t need any toner. Not me. You wanna know why. You wanna know why? Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself. Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye. Well. I only have one thing to do today. I guess I could push it back. It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist! II’m sorry? Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I’m gonna kill myself! I’ll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing. Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose. Oh my God, does she really thinks that? Well I don’t know, II suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could. Really? Great! Sure! This could’ve been hers! Your make-up kit? I’d feel better. Hey guy! No! That’s just the Hey Guy guy. He says that to everybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me! Yeah! Right! Oh no. Hey guy! Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya. The new girl’s good. That’s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days! Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove. Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I’m sorry. I’m afraid so. Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche. There was also leaves and guk and stuff. Screw it! I’m having one. Sorry, I don’t know any Earl. I’m right here! Phoebe? The lady who sells toner? Look, um I really appreciate your coming down. Why?! I thought it was toner. Really?! How? Couldn’t it just be a coincidence? It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate. I’m actually the office manager. Well, was there anything else?! Philadelphia. Really? Yeah-yeah. Did you hear that?! I don’t need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they’d care just a little bit though. Yeah. How are you honey? Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I’m sorry about everything that happened and I’d probably never be able to make it up to you, but here’s a start. It’s the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche. I’ve been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother’s right, I do look like an ass. Why don’t we take it for a spin? Rach! Come on! Rach! Hey. Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don’t use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good. Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on! Come on, let’s have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today? Look Rachel, I know what you’re going through. I’m totally freaked about turning 25. Why? What you’d do? You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely. It’s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo. Crap. Surprise! Is this yours? Right, why do you keep saying that? Yeah, no we’re not thirty. We’re 31. Okay. Oh, it’s you. Yeah, we’re not thirty, we’re 31. Yea-huh! That’s what is says on my birth certificate. Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died. Right! Okay. No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes! Phoebe. Right, okay, then no. Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! Don’t get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow. This one’s from me. It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun. Speech! Come on Monica! Come on! Speech! Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second! Oh-ho, I think it’s nice. Hey. How are you doing? Are you feeling any better? Okay. What’s up? Wait! I think I see where you’re going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing? Rachel, don’t do this. This is just because you’re turning thirty. Twenty-four actually. Me too. How hot are we? There was no credits scene with this episode. Hey! Oh! Noo! I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it! Oh yes there is! What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?! That was an accident! And so were you. Well, at least I’m not a murderer! Oh, my baby! Cut! Oh, just years of experience. Can I get some ice here?! You’re not the fan who’s dying are you? I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but that’s not supposed to be until later! Oh that was a real person?! III’m leaving the show? Who told you that? Which one? Was it bald or was it tall? Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true! And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I’ve been playing for 20 years. I’ll give you a tip! I’m 16. You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently it's going to be very soon and that’s it. Yeah, thanks. Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again? Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. It wasn’t my decision! I’m having a conversation here! You were saying? All right Joey, I will help you. Not because II owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica. You’re so welcome. Is that supposed to be me? Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent. So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try. No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again. Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it! All right, it’s a little weird, but it’s getting better. Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do! I mean, it’s been 20 years of my life. I am. I am, but I don’t know, you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy. I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And. Ohh, I turned down some amazing work! Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today! But. Well now, now’s a different time for me. You think I’m hot? Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the. So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man’s face. No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it? That was good, that was really good. But II think your hands may be a little off, they should be maybe right like. Who is it? Hi! It’s Tom, I’m here to pick up the phone. Hi! No that’s my assistant. Umm, no. Sure! Sure. So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh? Okay. Okay. Well, you certainly own that room. Well, it’s nice to know that you. Oh that explains all the women’s underwear. Certainly. I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore. I really can’t slap you. Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry about it. What? They don’t? How does it happen? Ah what?! Jessica hates horses! No! Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired. Thank you sweetheart. I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. Who are you?! What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own mother?! Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you! That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you’re a better Jessica than I ever was! Well of course not, but you were very good. And guess what? Good news! I got another job! A film in Guadalajara! No that’s La Guardia. This is Mexico. Eight months. Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there. That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You’ve, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful. You too. Eee! Do it again! Hi. Thanks Phoebe! Don’t talk to me now! I’ll be okay. Bye dad. Not really. Okay. I’m not allowed to have soda. What’s a virgin? But you’re not anymore! ‘Cause you guys were on a break. When’s my daddy coming back? Sharing is good. Really? Like how? That’s a good one. Yeah, you’re funny. Can I do it to you? Hey Rachel! What a nice surprise! What are you doing here? Can I ask what—Come on in. Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat. Gotcha! Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee? Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday? Don’t do that. Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks. Oh damnit! Damnit! Damnit! Oh crap! Three! No more pranks. That you and daddy were not on a break. Hey Ross! What’s not funny? Oh I…I think they’re funny. What? Oh my God! Crap! What did we just finish talking about Ben?! What’s my little chef got for me tonight? Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay. Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin’? Could you guys help me? It-it’s really heavy. II am Kristen. I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over. But-but this block is like a whole other world. Excuse me? Oh I’d like that. Yeah. After you. Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I’d cry. I’m Megan Bailey. Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one. Oh, thanks for the tip. Oh I’m not, I just like to try these on. I’m just kidding. I’m getting married July 25th. So when are you getting married? Oooh it’s getting close! So uh, who’s your photographer? We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did? I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who’s your band?! Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. I own this store. I’m moving in. Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back. No. Kristen. Kristen. So uh, do you live around here? I’ll remember that. Oh I, I have plans tonight. But how about tomorrow? You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes. What is taking so long?! I mean whatever! Here he comes! Hurry! Let’s go! Monica! Yeah! No! And now you’ll see me buying it. Look, you don’t want to fight me. Hey! Kristen Lang. Oh great! Is your back feeling better? Joey! Hi! What are you doing here? Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross. Our table will be ready in a couple minutes. Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives. Yeah, little Eric. You’ve been married twice? You said the waiter ate my crab cake. Do you two know each other? No. No. What kinda noise? But like how? Yes sir. Why?! What’d I get? That’s not so good. Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I’m sort of in love. I’m in love with you. You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having a hard time concentrating. When you’re up there and you’re teaching and your face gets all serious…you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater… Hi! Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend. I thought you knew I was looking at you. Bye Phoebe. All right. Bye. I miss you already! Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize… …in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital, Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless, Duncan Harrington from Passions, and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.

I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade. Because I’m in love with you. Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade? Well why not? You changed Ned’s grade! No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s done this with three other teachers! He’s got a girlfriend! I know! It’s awful. I love you. Come in. Hi. Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?! No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you’ll excuse me. That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut? What?! Why? I’m not trying to pull anything. Look, I love you dude. Joey! It’s Estelle! I just talked to the casting people: they loved you! Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow. There’s just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity? I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler. Nice to meet you too. Yeah. Hi-hi Joey. Actually, I tried to call you. You didn’t need to come down here today. Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it. Well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow. Oh, and your agent said you were okay with the nudity. Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah, and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t Jewish. So… So uh well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying? Okay. An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be… Okay. Hey Ross! It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi. Ah yeah, sorry about that. Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot. Oh my God! You do a great Chandler! Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me. I’m all done. I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together. I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles. It took you that long to figure it out, huh? Hi! Oh thank you. No. No thanks. I was her accountant four years ago. I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes these last four years. So, what time is Monica supposed to get here? I don’t know. Hey! What the hell are you doing?! Yeah. Oh that’s great! Okay, well I’ve heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie… Joey, this is the awkward part. Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here. What? Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please? Oh umm, uh we don’t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street. That’d be great, thanks. Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! You have been M. I. A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?! So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray. Shut up! Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph? Are you?! Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night? You do now. You’re having dinner with me. II’ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here’s my card. Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference. I’m a party planner. I’ll see you tomorrow. …anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? What one? Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? What? Yeah? Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about. I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened. I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping. She didn’t. Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, II don’t think I’ll be calling you because umm, y’know you’ve gotten weird. Take care you guys. My God! You love me! Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin’ together I… I just didn’t want to tell you ‘cause I didn’t think that you’d return my love, and now that you have… Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. Shut up! Oh you don’t have to be sorry. I’m…I’m obviously kidding. I’m not in love with you. I’m not in love with her. I don’t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don’t…picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh…kiss good-bye? No? Okay. Hi, I'm Ross's little sister. Ohhh! Bye! She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel. Hey guys! Ready to go? Wait a minute! Over a month. Sure, I’d like that. It's Jake. Yeah, big fan. Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday. Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas and the strip before we arrive at 4 Queens bar, where Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table waiting for the show to start. Has someone taken your order yet? Hm-mmm? You’re straight. I get it. Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket! Hello darlings. Can I see your license please? Your license? That’s Hanson. Wow! This is a great picture. Yeah? Well you look phenomenal. Yes I am. You’re an Aquarius, huh? Nope. Nope. Nope. Yep. Well I tell you what… You’re not gonna speed anymore right? And you promise you’ll get this taken care of right away? And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license? Can he handle the stick? I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and… Gay! For I’m loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. Where are you from? Bakersfield. I’m sorry? Bakersfield! No-no I heard! I’m just sorry. Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey let me see your pretty face. So what’s your name? Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating parents. And who is your friend? Monica! Where are you from? I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh? Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day? I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you’re bald? We? Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something. Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life… It’s raining men! Hallelujah! It’s raining men! Amen! Do you know how fast you were traveling back there? You’re right. It was 37. That’s right. Your license please. It’s Petty. I’ll be right back with your ticket. Hi! I don’t think so. Wow! Really?! 4.50 please. Greg Malins Part II Written by: David Crane amp Marta Kauffman Parts I amp II Transcribed by: Eric Aasen. Hey Joey! Were ready. Richard? Were ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby, hes playing Vincent. Nice to meet you Joey. No I didnt. I think I lost. Three times. Okay! Were about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys dont mind, can we run it a couple of times? Yeah, sure. Okay, all right. Lets do it. AndAction! Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone! The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony! No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta! Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong? I dont think so. Lets take it back to Richards last line. Action! We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna! Chandler! Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon therell be lots of little Bings. Its lovely to meet you. So are you his mother or his father? Jack! What?! Ive never seen one before! I didnt even have a chance to act as though Im okay with it! Hello all! Nora! Charles. Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Arent you a little old to be wearing a dress like that? Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that? of course you can kick his ass son. You could kick anyones ass you want to. Im Amanda. Doctor Ross Geller. To the Bings! Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me? Just the last two pages. I found the picture! Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction. Oh, thanks. Well of course I am! Thats what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit! Great! No. No, I havent seen him. Hes getting married tomorrow, right? I wasnt invited. Well, you kids talk about this place so much, we thought wed see what all the fuss is about. I certainly see why the girls like coming here. The sexy blonde behind the counter. Your mother just added him to her list. Yeah, the list thatof people were allowed to sleep. And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know Im looking for her. Action! I found the picture! The picture of my wife! In your pack! Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?! Cut! Wonderful! Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me. Heres your call sheet for tomorrow. You are now. Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We cant stop filming just for you. Its not like its your wedding. What?! What kind of surgery?! But youre supposed to work on Monday. But youre not bald. Look Joey, theres nothing I can do. Besides, youre probably gonna be out by four anyway. Weve just got one short scene. Its just you and Richard, and God knows hes a pro. Youll be fine. Morning Richard. Im wearing two belts. No! All right. That can be arranged. Lets reset. Lets take it from there. Are you a little off today? Its going terribly slowly. Of course! ImIm sorry. IId hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this! Still rolling, annnnd action! Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger! Here comes the bride. I dont know. Are they Greek Orthodox? I thought he was with you. You cant ask us son, thats cheating. Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress. As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress. But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then. Honey, it isnt good luck. Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting. You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork? Well have we finished the scene? As were you. Why? Are we done for the day? Oh, thank you. Youre welcome. Is that my ass? Cigarettes?! Way to go son! I knew youd find him! Our little boy is getting married. Oh look at you! So handsome! Are you Chandler? Oh I wish your grandmother had lived to see this. Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling. I love you sweetheart. I am Father Kalebasous. Let us begin. Dearly beloved. Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film. Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier. Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids. Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids. Smile ladies. Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing! Oh hi, I’m, I’m Mona from her restaurant. You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it. Uh-huh. Really?! Well see? I never knew about her. Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name. Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d like you to meet Dennis Phillips. Congratulations. Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover. Oh, I’m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions. Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show. Dennis Phillips. Oh, thank you. Well if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. Well, it’s a funny story. Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served. No, nine. Champagne? Hi! Sure. Yeah. Dr. Geller? Dr. Geller, will you dance with me? Okay. Ohhhh! I’d be happy to. You are very sweet. Sure! Uh-huh. Thank you. Melinda! How cute was that? Can I go next? Okay, but I get to hop on after her. What? Thank you. Can we do it again? So, is it my turn now? I’m next! Uh, that’s okay. You can dance with her first. Gert! Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it. Why aren’t you moving your feet? Faster! You’re not going fast enough! Oh my God, that was for my benefit? Look umm Joey, II don’t think you’re quite right for this project. It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese? Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don’t-don’t-don’t! Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested. You stole my moves. No! That is so sweet! No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there. It’s Joey right? Here’s a copy of your bill. Oh! Of course. Uh, would you take one of us? It didn’t click. But there was no flash. Why won’t you take our picture? Uh, your finger was covering the lens. Hey Rach. That’s my car! Yes! Yes! Yes! Green-blue! So, what’s this about? No. This is my red sweater. What’s going on Rach? Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together. It is the right time. I’m ready for more. Come on Rach, let’s give it another try. Oh. Thank you. Oh my God! Good! Good, long time no see. Like your sweater. Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh? So whose is it? Okay. Next? Next? Sorry. We didn’t hear you we’re on our honeymoon. Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available. Next? Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K. I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two. You said there was a gas leak in here. Because by the time I find it on this thing, the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up. Uh sir, may I see your tickets please? I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number. Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I’m sorry. Sir! I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave. I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak. Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door. Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll find out anyway. Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross! Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today? Namaste. As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite. Who are you? Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together. Okay Rachel, are you comfortable? The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram. Am I interrupting? Huh. Nice to meet you. I’ll get started on this. Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby. Congratulations. I’ll give you two a minute. Tradition was broken here as there were no commercials immediately after the opening credits, just more show. Hey! Umm, this is great wine. Really? I studied for a year in Barcelona. I love hiking! I think its Tibidabo. Ah. Oh. Ohh! Ew! Hi. Actually she’s my-my boss. Sous is French for under. Yeah. Yes I did. I…II don’t know, but I would say it’s pretty good-o. I like your necklace. You are so talented. Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil. You’re a joker Bing. Hey Toby! Have a good night. Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss. What is it? Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain. Is it serious? Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain. Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that. We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone. Cut! Very nice people! Hey good scene man. Alright. Yes? Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before? Bye. Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today? Toby! Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too? Oh then you know each other. What do you think of adding him to our team? Really? They love him down on six. Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. That’s a good one. Hey Toby, you got a sec? I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler? Hey Joey. Hey. Yeah. Hey Rachel! You ready to go? Thank you. Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe? It’s because I’m with you. Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here. Hey Toby! It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is? I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is. Toby don’t. Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler! I got your page, is everything okay? Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us! What? Why? Wow! Umm, okay.

You could be my sister for the day. Huh. Well, I’m supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I’m supposed to be working right now, so who cares. Oh! Okay, so that’s why you’re… Trick or treat! Trick or treat! Thank you. Thank you. Can I just have the candy? Trick or treat! Thank you. Thank you. I love you! Aren’t you gonna give me a kiss? Ursula? Oh my God, you’re the sister! Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law’s ass. I’m an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt. She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, Look at me, I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go. Eric. ‘Cause the sweat’s getting in my eyes and its burning. I don’t think they have a name for it. It’s just I get nervous I start sweating like crazy. Oh umm, I’m the solar system.

In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met. Yeah. It wasn’t a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left.

They’re both really strong. Yay! My hero! Hey. Ursula said she left her purse. What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain. Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding. I think we’ll be okay. Besides it’s so perfect and she’s been saving herself for me. What? She told me she was 25. I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher. There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies. I’m not smart. I just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. To be romantic. It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different. Eric! Let’s go! I’d better go, deal… Hurry up I gotta pray! R.

If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along. Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective. Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink. You can take some caster oil, theres eating spicy foods. taking a long walk, and then theres the one thats proved most effective: sex.

I.cant.believe this! I mean this is so great! Were gonna be baby buddies! Hi sweetie! Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I dont think youve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologists office. Thank God for adult acne huh? I still cant believe it! Im the luckiest guy in the world! Whatd he say? Oh yknow what? You have to speak very loudly when youre talking to Sid, because hes almost completely deaf. So? Congratulations you two, I didnt even know you got married. What?! Why?! Oh. Well then shut me up. Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. Chandler Bing! Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler. Its you. This is yours. Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years! Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him. No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy. Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me. Twenty-one hours, youre a hero. Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room. Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom. Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? Oh my God! Thats the doctor who was in my room before! Im telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions! That-thats him! You know him? I dont believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor? And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy. I dont think so. It doesnt happen to me either. Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 54 Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds. Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something. Its the babys buttock, shes breech. Shes gonna be fine. Okay, shes in a more difficult position so youre gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push! Rachel youre gonna have to push even harder, nothings happening! Good! Here we go! Here she is! Do we have a name yet? Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green. Yoo-hoo! Aaron LitmanNeurolic would like to say hello to his future bride. Hes a keeper. How are you feeling? Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone. Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married? Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family. Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs. I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own. Oh hi! Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law. Im gonna leave the three of you alone. Bye. Sherry BilsingGraham amp Ellen Plummer Transcribed by: Eric Aasen. Wheres my granddaughter? Ive been practicing my magic tricks. She went to pick up Aunt Liddy. So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? Look at her, my first grandchild. Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow. Noted. Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever. I think there are people in there having sex. Wanna peek? Come on! Well Im peeking. Oh my God! Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again? Its all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but dont worry. Itll happen. Why dont we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. Of course. Ill always be your dad. Oh, I dont think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time. What? Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! Ill guard the door! Whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont think so! Arent you ovulating? Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thats how I got my bad hip. This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was. Youre right, youre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good. But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor? Hey, she just woke up! Shes hungry. Why dont we give this another try? Ill come back for her later. Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant. Dana Klein Borkow Transcribed by: Eric Aasen. Hi, welcome home! The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields. Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you Ill go straight to my forty two point plan. Ok if everyones on board, its settled, Chandler, Chandler? Are you on board? Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa. Youre gonna love Oklahoma. Diapers huh? So I guess Rachel had you baby? Nope!  I still cant believe she slept with you in the first place. What? You fell asleep? Chandler, I. Hi! Ross: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for? Chandler: Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa, so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated. Ross: Oh my God! Phoebe: What?! Rachel: What?! Ross: Monday?! Joey: How long do you have to go for? Chandler: They said it could be up to a year. Joey: A year?! Rachel: Do you have to go? Monica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing Chandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh? Joey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week. Chandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it. Joey: We were gonna go see the Jets! Ross: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together! Chandler: Really? Ross: Not you. Joey: I can't believe you guys are moving. Phoebe: I call their apartment! Everyone: No! Ah! Ahh! Here you are Rachel: Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine. Ross: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk. Rachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener. Joey: Rachel: Every time? Joey: Uhuh. Ross: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this. Rachel: All right, I trust you. Ross: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why. Rachel: I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener? Joey: Phoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up. Joey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. Phoebe: Look at you all grown up. Joey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as. Nah, she's gotta be hot. Phoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date! Joey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday? Phoebe: Done. Oh good, really? Joey: Yeah! Phoebe: Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack. Joey: Poophack. Phoebe: Yeah. All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller Joey: Hey! Monica: Hey! Chandler: I've got good news! Monica: You got out of the whole Tulsa thing? Chandler: Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job. Monica: It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you. Monica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No. Chandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that? Monica: No. I can't be away from you for that long. Chandler: Really? Monica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year. Chandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa. Monica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you. Chandler: Hey, you said that without gagging! Monica: I know! Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! Ross: Who the hell was that?! Rachel: Dr. Wiener. Ross: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning. Rachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife! Ross: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma? Rachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane! Ross: Well, what was it? Rachel: Hiccups. Ross: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up. Rachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name? Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead. Rachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?! Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well. Rachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot. Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! Rachel: Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener! Ross: Rachel! Rachel: Great! Now he's gonna know it was me! Hey! Joey: Hey! Phoebe: So how is this for our big double date tonight? Joey: Oh my God! Phoebe: Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for. Joey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget? Phoebe: Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy. Joey: No. Phoebe: Come on, give me something. What's his name? Joey: Mike. Phoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name? Joey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!? Phoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours. Joey and Phoebe: Joey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said. There's no guy in there! It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee? Monica: Excuse me? Chandler: I know what she's talking about. Rachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it. Monica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman? Rachel: Ross said he died. Monica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox. Rachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died. Monica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist. Chandler: He saw a therapist? Monica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out. Rachel: Why? What was it? Monica: That I was going to eat him. MIKE! Mike: Yeah? Joey: Okay! I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks. Joey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike. Mike: I am Mike. Joey: Atta boy! Joey: Okay, look. Everyone: Phoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway? Mike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that. Joey: From school. Mike: Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school. Phoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days? Mike: Well, I'm a lawyer. Joey: Mike, 'attorney at law'! Mike: Actually, I just gave up my practice. Joey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me. Mike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will. Phoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so. Joey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike. Mary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer. Joey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail. Hey! Chandler: Hey! Monica: What are you doing? Chandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa. Monica: That's so sweet. Find anything? Chandler: Slim Pickings. Monica: Nothing, huh? Chandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite. Monica: 'Slim Pickings'. That is so cheesy. Chandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening. Monica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something. Chandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa. Monica: Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated. Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!' Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma. Receptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly. Dr. Gettleman: I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep. Ross: Thanks doctor. Dr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop? Ross: You even have to ask?! He is alive! You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you. Joey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car. Mike: No, I didn't. Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay? Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'. Mike: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar! Phoebe: What?! Mike: What?! Joey: What?! Phoebe: Do you not know each other? Joey: Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?! Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have? Mike: Six! Joey: What are you doing? I said seven! Argh! Phoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger? Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry. Mike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car. Phoebe: You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose. Mary Ellen: Hey! Phoebe: Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating! Joey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike! Mike! Phoebe: I'm out of here Mike: It was nice meeting you! Joey: You're leaving too? Mary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name. Joey: Good night! Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do. Monica: You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go. Chandler: What? Monica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo. It's just a little outside of Tulsa. Chandler: How far outside? Monica: Manhattan. Chandler: And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job. Monica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Chandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'? Monica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend. Chandler: I think you should take the job. Monica: Really? Chandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey. Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me! Ross: Hey! Monica: How was the pediatrician? Rachel: Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good. Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything. Rachel: I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician! I don't care! Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman? Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician! Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer? Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor. Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!' Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy? Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college! Chandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging! Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall! Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk? Phoebe: Sure. Mike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer. Apparently I'm not a funny guy. Phoebe: Why did you go along with that? Mike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did. Phoebe: That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true? Mike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano. Phoebe: Prove it. Mike: There isn't a piano here. Phoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist. Mike: Phoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself. Mike: Really? Phoebe: Uhuh. Mike: That's great. What kind of music do you play? Phoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers. Mike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could. Phoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out. Mike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out? Joey: Phoebe: Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice. Joey: Look at this.

Vicrum? WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME! Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT!

Oh that couldn't have been pretty… but you know guys do that. yea well the weird part is, he was getting off to a shark attack show! Nooo! Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn! well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing? do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing. man sharks… I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what. what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone… not if he gets his jollys to jaws! Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice. Eww are you talking about my bother. yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i. Hey. Hi. listen to this. I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her. so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again. well that's not even the weird part… I don't think she remembered sleeping with me. But you don't remember sleeping with her. yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know. what, how do we know, we never slept with you. and who's fault is that. what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night. HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST! Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again. yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other. Interesting… all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY! Joey, Joey. What? you don't think sharks are sexy do you? No… wait a minute what was the little mermaid? It's open. Hey! HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY! YAY! quick thing, I went to talk to Mike. What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS! oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that… WHAT! umm… that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum. WHAT! WHY? well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship. If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW! well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah. I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him. Good yeah just be honest with him. yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave… which he will and that's ok… so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be… it'll be fine… it'll be fine… I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh. I'll get it. ok. You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok? Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called. so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest. Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me? What? How could you not remember that we slept together? What! When? I dunno! I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you. come on, come on, search your brain all right… it was a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here NOT there. Anything? no it's not ringing any bells. my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this? Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey! Ooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out. …and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel. But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross. yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee. that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer. I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer. I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but… maybe me. Oh. and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me… although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy. ok I can't do this. what's wrong? well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so… if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me. uh huh. so you don't think I'm a total freak. No… well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you. I guess so, can I… can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers. Definitely. This is Vicrum. Hi honey I'm home! Hi, how was your flight? oh it was great. Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I… have a little surprise for you. well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY. C! Ok This is how much I love you. Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around. Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier. no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all. Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks? does what always have to be sharks. Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash. What's going on? sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this. let ME be a part of this! I saw what you were doing in Tulsa… angry sharks turn you on! no they don't. then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat. OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn. really? yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action. I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that. Im very, very drunk right now. see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her? Phoebe: you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious. Scott Silveri. That's right. Is it true the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to? I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you? Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one? That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke. I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York? So, are we expecting the rest of our party shortly? Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable. It's just that we do have some large parties waiting. Hello. Hey. It's been an hour. Would you be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table? You can't order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy. Strange man. Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss! I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his willie between his legs and cried out: Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you. It doesn't. Oh, they're both exquisite. Hey, hi, hi! I'll just wait to put your order in. I'll give you another minute. Mhum. I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning. How was everything, sir? Well, I hope you've got some room left. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear. Joey, happy birthday to you. Marta Kauffman amp David Crane Transcribed by: Coffee Mug Russian to Roman alphabet: Gabriela Horber Dedicated to the great work of Eric Aasen, Guineapig and many, many more. This is nice. You need both hands for that? Is it? Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time. Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you, and, this may be crazy soon, but. I want you to have this. No, not, that's gum. Ooh, five bucks. I love it when that happens, you know. Think no note's there. Oh, sorry. It's to my apartment. Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because. Oh, thank God. Is this cool, huh? I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. Not really. Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing? That's cool. But, but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice. Hi. I'm Sandy. Hi! I-i-is this a bad time? Well, just for a couple of days, uhm. I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm, accomplished uhm, nothing. Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just, gave him your address I. I. I didn't even think about it. Damn it! Wa, wa, wait! We can, call them later. Can you just, just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm, it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul, ui! Roughly translated that means uhm. This thing that I'm looking at: wow! Are, are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but, well, you are. Well, so, uhm, are you seeing, anyone? I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart. It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. II'm engaged actually. Her name is Deliah. I realise how it's, a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child. Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person. When I left, I said: I'll see you soon. And he said to me: Skdandy. That was his name for me. I'll see you every day, right in. Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want. I er. I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus. It keeps the hands young. That's great! I'm sorry. It's just, such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family. Wow, you look even, more beautiful than you did yesterday. In fact, ehm. I going to kiss you now. Yeah, II don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. IIIt sounded sexy in my head, so I. Oh, oh. No, well, yeah. Well, i-it's okay. III understand. Well, s, well, are you happy with this guy? Damn it! II'm sorry. II don't mean that. II want you to be happy. But only with me. No, uhm, that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him! Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do. I'm sorry Uhm, I. I think I should probably uhm, go. Well, just so you know, hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either. Can we at least hug goodbye? No, no. In Minsk. it's uhm, i-it's two on each cheek and uhm, and one on the lips. Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem. You know, I can't tell it again. But. IIIt's nice. A-a-and, nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing. But, ergo. Uhm, uhm. Goodbye. Uh. Schto ya ztez vigul, ui. Well, hey, the key works.! So, how many guys have your key? Your lipstick's on his mouth. Oh, uh, we just uh, happen to wear the same shade. Did you uhm. kiss him? Yes, but uhm. You should know, she really likes you. IIn fact III don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. Don't point your finger at me. Why? WhWhat are you going to do about it? Well. I'll, just show you what I'm gonna do about it. Allright. But, if I ever do come back from Minsk, well, you just better watch out. Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out. Oh, you're going to Minsk? Well, I might. Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there. Right. Goodbye Phoebe. Hey, what are you kidding me? Right-o, right-o. Take good care of her. It's never gonna happen again right? II. Oh I. I just wanna say uhm, if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number We'll uhm, we'll party up Vladnik style. Who's up for puppets? Well, please welcome. The Snufflebumps. Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus? Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development. The whimsical characters are just for us. Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus. So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaare. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because. I liked you the best. No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home. Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future. What is it? Please? That's fair. Although, can I ask, why do you think that is? hmmm. That must have been hard. But you are a real boy! It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out. And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink? What kind? A friend-ship. Oh, I gotta go. Twenty bucks.

You know what would be incredible? If you guys died. no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.

Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you. I'll take care of it. Oh absolutely. Are you looking to meet somebody? We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit. Sorry we were just leaving. Gavin! I brought you some soup. I heard you were sick. I missed you at work today. How are you feeling? Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me. So I had fun last night. Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you? Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum. What's Ross doing to you on that picture? Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything. Yeah! But you said not to worry about. Hi! No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember? Don't panic! There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse. Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there. Hello! I just go and get Emma. So hum. Why did I have to hide? So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two. You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a. It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice? I think you should talk to Ross about all this. Don't be. It's just bad timing. One of the best, ma'am, one of the best. Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth. Well I've got a book around. You already hit on me an hour ago. Why would he break up with me? I don't know sweetie. All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable? All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of I touch myself. Coming up next we've got Monica. Like an XRay. Bad day not to wear a bra. Sure. Also a good gift? Underwear. Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do. It’s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it’s like you lose a boyfriend, No don’t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric. What are you taking amoxicillin for? Ah, who is Emma? This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy! Ross, you didn’t tell me you were a doctor! Actually about an hour and a half. You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me! Hey, do you want to go away this weekend? Emma. No, actually, see I had to pee, ‘cause I can’t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites. Well, call me! No, wait, you don’t have my phone number! Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots. Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet. Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name. Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross. Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy. Can I get you another glass of wine? Got stood up, huh? Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left? I - I just have to say this you're really beautiful. I'm kind of funny looking. Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich! Well, I'm not! So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken. I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs. That ain't gonna happen. I lost it. To drugs. I silk-screen t-shirts now. It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile. Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself. I do like my hair. Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone. Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise. Okay, I'll try. I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left. Look you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house. Ooh. What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that. Just get out of here, okay? Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home. Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am. I - I can't believe I’m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic. Really? Hey, Rach, how's it going? Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up? Why the hell did you take her? Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but. Would you like to make love to me? Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway. unknown yet Transcribed by: Johannes Pohl. Ah!

Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready? Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much. No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you. Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. I have a gun. Alright, lady, now give me your purse! Phoebe? Oh my god! Ross, nice to meet you. Ough, I know, but I quit smoking! So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you? Hey, hey! Geology rocks! You're late! No, Lennart doesn't wait! Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly! We must go now, quickly, please. Ready? What the hell are you still doing here? Oh, you sick bastard! What? Then go, go! Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for. Yes. Plus… what you've got that… I don't know what you've got going… this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the, do all of this what you've got going now, but – you know what? – more, more. Can you do that? Look at that: still in character, I like it… I plant seeds I can't explain. Hey! … and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander… Your age? Chandler, that's great! You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's…. You did you come up with that? That is great. Good work! See all of you tomorrow. III can't tell you somethin' I don't know. I don't know! Alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is… She never loved me, she only loved you. Absolutely amazing! The part is yours. Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it!

I put that tube top on as a joke. I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can. Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home. No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now, and partly because I live above a known crack den but, mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So, do you want to move in together? So we're doing it? Yeah! Hey! Phoebe and I are moving in together. Congratulations! Good for you! Great! I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yes dear. You ready to go? What are you talking about? Listen this is really nice. Do you. Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you? Excuse me. Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little groomy joke. I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is, maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right? Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go. Look. Phoebe, II love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again. It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea. At one point near the end she deliberately defecated. Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong! Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again. I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea. Trust me, I will never. You're all set. Thanks. It's over Joe! Very cool. No but. You don't want to get married either right? You wanna get married? But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before? I want to live with you too! Let's do that! Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage. No. But I don't want this to end. I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up. Ok, so. Goodbye. Bye bye Mike! Cya mike! Bye mike! Bye bye now! Phoebe called me. Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see. Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name! So how've you been? You look really beautiful. Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you. I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night. It can't be any harder than this. I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I. I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time. I never would have stopped. I knew you'd be here! Oh, crap! My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you. Well, you are not doing a very good job! What's with the kissing? Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing! I've heard the speech: if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her. You're weak! Your pants are undone! Where did they go? Oh we blew it. I blame myself. Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class. Thanks, uh. I'm so sorry about Ross, it's. Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone? What? You. You. Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close? Hey, listen. Call me. Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service. Yeah. And you are. I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad. We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him. I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance. You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!

And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library. And first, I have to see the MET! No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular! The museum! Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you? This has been torn up. Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready. Have a seat through the glass doors. Through the glass doors. Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room. Sorry, everyone is booked! Then why you work here? Well, I think this is a great place to work! Mr. Bing? Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container. OH MY GOD! Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this! Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we. Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size. Please, go! Just let me know if you need a hand! Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit? That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results? Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is. Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine. What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office? Hi! The museum was amazing! Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around. No, we went to the left. Yeah, it's fun. Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well it would be weird. Well. I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone. I have more in common with. You know what I mean? Yeah, I guess that's true. He is very sweet. Plus he's hot! Hey! Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross. Good morning Phoebe. Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1. Andrew Reich amp Ted Cohen Directed by: Ben Weiss Transcribed by: Eleonora, Pheeboh, Sebastiano amp Vanessa. Oh! That feels sooo good! I'm sorry, what? From. Cosmo? So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes! I'm sure you have better things to do. If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help. Hi there. I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options. Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis. Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor. And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt. Oh, yeah! Let's do it! Umh. Kurts Baley? So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions? He's a pretty tough guy to impress. We'll see you, guys! Mmm-mm. Incentive For Men? So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be? See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a thank you, I would really love to take you out. Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come? You've seen all the movies. Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else! You too. Thanks. Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring. Just be honest with her. And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone. Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks! You guys have such a great place here. Uhm, no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Ducokus. Okaaay, so eh, so tell me, how did you guys meet. No. You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh? Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny. Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and, and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else? Sure! Alright. Ravioli's delicious! No I didn't. Oh! trying on clothes. Rachel. I heard you guys whispering. No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey. It's just that. I don't understand it. I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy? Wow! You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person. You're welcome. Phoebe! Hi! Wow, you look unbelievable. Well, I'm back from Minsk, permanently. Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles? Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done. Good, good, life is good. Ah well, II'm seeing someone. She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and, well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said Boy, I want that. You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up. Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face. Yeah, I know. Well, this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now? Do you wanna get a drink? Great. Do you smell beets? Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with? There's a third guy? I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you? No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired. No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey Chandler. No you didn't. No you did. for Friday's pitch. Oh, thank you. Shana GoldbergMeehan amp Scott Silveri Part 2 written by: Marta Kauffman amp David Crane Directed by: Kevin S. Bright Transcribed by: Andreina, Eleonora, Pheeboh, Sebastiano amp Vanessa. Wow! This place is beautiful! Oh my God, I can't believe you're here! Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan! I've been following your career for years, II can't wait for your keynote speech. I would love your autograph. Sarah. Thank you so much! Are you a paleontologist? I'm sorry, I don't own a TV. Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion. Mike is your ex, uh, boyfriend! It's ok. Ho-honest mistake. Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh? Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right? Sorry, I just. I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe. I'm sorry, uh. I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know. Why did Phoebe and Mike break up? That's great! That's great! II'll propose to her! Well, I was probably going to do it at some point. Why not? It's brilliant! Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding. Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely. How do you think I should propose? I didn't mean a thong. I meant thongs. Oh my God! Did you talk to him? Yeah! Oh I can't. I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech. But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic. I will if you will. So you'll be ok? There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! So, um. I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight. Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's um, one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is um, is quite poor. It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference. Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic! Actually the wet season is June to December. Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night! Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner. Hello? Who is this? He, he's gonna propose? Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you. I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention. And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century. Yeah. Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech. Thank you. Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you. Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son, or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? Your first marriage? You're married more than once? So, why did you break up? Oh my God, this is so cool! No, it's just. I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay! Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner. Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: Oh, I knew all along. I know! I didn't do that. Hey! I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner. I had a great time. So, shall we? Bye. Ok, good night! Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have, something I wanna say. Uh, Phoebe, uh, you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help! But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end. It's David, actually! Hi Mike! Hi David. Chandler. Monica. Oh! Hi Phoebe. I have a question I need to ask you. I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself. Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this. Ok, would you care for my seat as well? Actually yeah, that'll be great. That's fair, you've had a long trip. Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you. Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say. Sorry David, but she really has to know this. Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops. I have a ring. Phoebe, will you marry me? Um. Ha ha! We can have any future you want. Ok, I'm gonna take off. Just so I know, if I had asked first. Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! Is it ok if I hug you now? What? You're, you're kidding, right? I thought, it was wonderful! Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone, so, young, and. You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it! Oh. I'm back! Yeah! You were incredible! You blew them away! I was not! Oh my God! I'm your groupie! They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff. Hey! There you are! I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon. You know. I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night. Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun! Yeah.  is it weird that it's not with each other? I think we need to talk.! I'll play ya! I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve? Oh, by the way. I'm awesome! You're ready to play? Wanna make it more interesting? Ten bucks a game? I'll make it a hundred! To see who goes first, you got a quarter? Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.  all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny! Do you? Do you? DO YOU? Game, point! You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that. And that's how it's done! That's what I'm thinking.  Serve the ball, chump. I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty! Jarvis? Oh, you're back, this is my wife, Nancy. Ross, can I talk to you for a minute? Uh, well. Joey and I broke up. Joey is a great guy, but we're just, so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best. I guess. There was um, there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else. Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? Or we could throw you both in now! Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. So you forfeit? Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat. Ok! Thanks! Are they still looking for us? I don't think they did. Um, so, I started to say you something earlier, um. There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I, was starting to have feelings, for someone else. I think you know. All right, all right. Andrew Reich amp Ted Cohen Transcribed by: Coffee Mug. Ooh. Dr. Geller! uhm. Is everything okay? Ooh. Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the. I could just. I uhm. I completely understand. Okay. YEAH! Seriously. What is it? What's wrong? Ooh, your lips are so soft. Do that again. Yeah. So, did you talk to Joey? Yeah, sounds like a good idea. Dr. Geller! PHD. It's so, something. You go girlfriend! Not once. You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during. You don't have to go home tonight, do you? Oh. Uhm. I can't do anything tonight. I have a date. Oh, it's, my girlfriend. Yeah. Well, when, you and I broke up I started seeing someone. Three months. I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise. Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material. Okay. Good luck. Hey, it's Mike. Oh, err, no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone. One more thing. There, might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table. Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up. Hi, I'm Precious, who are you? Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe? I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something? My name is Precious. I just can't believe this. Why? Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me? I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now? I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning. He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect. Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell. Sherry BilsingGraham amp Ellen Plummer Directed by: Ben Weiss Transcribed by: Kreidy. Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie. Yeah. Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules. That's not what we talked about! Hey. Good to see you, too. Hi, how you doin'? Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him. Willing to adopt triplets? No! Hi, hi. So. Dreading this? Actually. It's stuff you left at my apartment. And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want. Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little. Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again. Yeah. I haven't slept in four years! You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three! Sometimes I think that. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No. No, I can't. Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one. Oh, please, we're happy to help. We went through the same thing when we were adopting. Well, actually, I think this might help. It's pretty much all the information you need. Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back. I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us. The bathroom is down the hall, to your left. I would have told him to do it too. Yeah. You were? Huh? I have a badge in it. You wanna see it? What?!? I'm adopted? Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic. Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable? No, of course we're not. I know. Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard. Huh. Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke. What's green and says hey, I'm a frog? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny. Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet. Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor. Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies. How about tomorrow? You'd do that for us? Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up! Hey. Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen. I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet. I'm adopted?! What? Where did you hear that? He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell. You told him he's adopted? He isn't?! We have to get out of here, baby! I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan. Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off. I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely. You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay? Alright. God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so. Bye.

Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again! Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel. No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her. Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse! Wow, my flat is twice this size! Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly. Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training. Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and. Okay. Dana Klein Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano amp Vanessa. Hey! Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that! Hi! HI! I can't believe Emma is already one! Thank you! Which one are you? I was not ready for this today! No, no, no, no, no! Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday. Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years. Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be. Well your grandfather and I might not be here. That’s true!

Great. That was, that was just, yeah! oh! Now it’s a party! Uh, is it ok that I still think it looks delicious? Jack, look at this. I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny! No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now! Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane. Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime. Anyway, it was lovely seeing you. Bye. Bye dear. Nighty-night! Joey! It's Estelle! So, how did your audition go today? The one I told you about last week? Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared. No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home. Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye. Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. Wo-ish. What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis. Okay.

Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. You're kicking me out? Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl! You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative. You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy? You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill. Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way. hm-mmm. Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds. Ass and face. She was. Carbs found her. See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff. You can? Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute. Ugh, I'm sorry. Ella.

Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant. Yeah. No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you. Yes, absolutely. I'll call him. Mmh, he does have a pretty serious latex fetish. Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. What am I gonna do now? I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO? Sorry, looks like it's just him. Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning! So good to see you. Me too. I'm sorry. Ross Geller. Benjamin Hobart. Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise.

Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! You weren't there! Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room? So, tell me about it. M-m. Break up with Charlie! What? Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it. I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her. If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking! Joking it is! The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem? Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there. Interesting. Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place? Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota. Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday? Care to venture a guess? That's not even kinda close! Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing? Half a dozen. I see, and Dr. Biely? Three for excavation and two for analysis. Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band? No! I'm sorry, we were looking for Baby It's You. Baby It's You. You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell Boscodictiasaur. Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it. No, it starts with a silent M. And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! I haven't really settled on a spot yet! Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm, your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size? I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process. Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant. Well, there is just one small, stipulation. Hey, you got one right! Crazy, or, romantic? Ooor. Did you get the grant? What? Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man. I'm sure he was just joking, Ross. Seriously? Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then MBO. Dr. Geller? Charlie. What are you, what are you doing here? Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. Benji? Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life. I can't believe this. I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me? Yes! I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so, romantic. Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back? Maybe. Oh God! I am so sorry, but. I mean it's, there's so much history between us, you know. I'm sorry too. I love you! I love you too! Mark Kunerth Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano amp Vanessa Final check by Kim. Oh, figuring out our wedding plans. I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry. Are you serious? I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. May I help you? Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated. Well, this is very generous! Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers. Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter. Not necessary. And X is spelled uhm. Mike Hannigan. Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much. It does. It feels really good! Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym. Ready sweety? We’re seriously asking for our money back? Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t think that that’s ever happened before. Gay, go. Oh my God, I love your shirt! Excuse me? So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children? Yeah! This feels really good. Hey, it’s not my business, besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing… She could have been talking about either one of us. Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview. Thank you! Oh, water would be fine. Your place is just lovely. You know, I. I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting? Oh. I just realized why I remember this place. Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well. Yes! Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't. So you're not friends with him? OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No! Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child. What was that? What's going on? Is he alright out there by himself? Bert and Ernie! You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that. Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that. No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there. Alright, fine. We'll give the money back. Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other. Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in. Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here. Oh my God! What are you doing here? Are you friends with him? Excuse me? I gave you my number, you never called me. Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number. I don't know. Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry. Joey, wait! I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed. Boy, you people are nice. And I've got to say. I think you're going to make excellent parents. Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM. No, no, we're here to give the money back. If I haven't said so already sir, congratulations! Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now, what do you think we should do? You know what? It's not your decision anymore. What? On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money. Yeah. And I'm giving it back to you. Come on! Consider it a contribution. Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together. Well, I mean. It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation. Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian. No!

Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica. Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica. Hi. Hi. I'll let you get acquainted. So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815D. Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's, kind of intimidating. You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend? Hey! This place is awesome! Hey, check this out! It’s totally you! Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption? Wow. I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. So, how’s everything going in here? We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions. Do you have any question for Erica? Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it. Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk. Actually, I don’t think we have to. Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. I've made my decision. I choose them. We got some really great stuff! A garden salad for the lady. Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy! Mmmh, those fries look delicious. Oh wow, are those stuffed clams? They are delicious. Oh, that is so sweet. What? what is the matter with you? But you just said What's mine is yours? Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal. Wow, this place looks great. Me too! Sure Just not as much as clams. Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman. Yes, that's Raspberry coule. Oh my God! Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece. Mmmm! Mmm! Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me? What are you doing? I thought you don't share food. No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street. Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. Hi! So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it. Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. I don't understand. What? That's impossible. I'll go check your file. Excuse me. So who are you? So you lied to me before? I can't believe this. Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? I don't want to look at your file! This is over. I've nothing to say to you. Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.

You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that. I intend to marry her.

But other than that, he's a great guy. We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq. Good job. We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob. No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing. Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy, it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. Whenever you're ready Joey. I'm sorry, what's going on? Joey, do you speak French? You know what. I think this audition is over. You really think this man is speaking French? Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part. It was great. Oh yeah!

Rachel? How've you been? Sure, sure. What's with the chair. Clever. So how are you? Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.

Why don't you introduce me? Oh! Why don't you tell her my name? Crap Bag? If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap. Okay. Excuse me. Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

What can I do for you? Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? Wow, that is tempting. She is good! But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. Ah, it's not true, there is, nothing I want to do. Yeah, his name is Ross. What? Yeah, they're all he talks about, why? You can really arrange that? Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs. Joey, it's Estelle. It's a little coincidental, but believable. Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie. I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie! Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic? What are you saying? Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around. So? What do you think? Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one. Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she… Oh my God! Sure. You two know each other? Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie. Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. Who is it? This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job. Not good, Ron. Wow, that's pretty cool. Okay, you got it. This is gonna make me very popular. I meant with my son. All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And. I'll see you later, neighbor. Oh, me too. Huh? Oh, my. Chandler, what are you talking about? I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, obviously we have this, heat between us. But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now. Chandler, one of us has got to be strong. Although, maybe just, one last moment of weakness. Goodbye Chandler Bing. YAY! WHOO! YAY!

At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? I know. No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out. Hi. That's because I'm pregnant! Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts. Okay, well, stop staring at them. Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel. Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks! I'll be right back. Are, are you kidding? This is packing? Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff? Hey Rach, hey you. Hi you guys! You know, I had a chance to stop her too! You doing ok? No, no, no, no! Yeah. Hi! Hey! Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had. Ooh. Hoo, ooh. Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers. Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes. You can do this. Just breathe. Ooh! Are you sure? Marta Kauffman amp David Crane Directed by: Kevin Bright Transcribed by: Kreidy. Previously on Friends. Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes. No, I'm okay. I don't know. Maybe church-camp? What? Help me! This hurts! Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse! The baby's head is crowning. Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders. Is he okay? He's just fine. Would you like to cut the umbilical cord? We'll just get him cleaned up a bit. I'm really happy for you guys. I'm tired! Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute. The next baby should be along in a minute. You know it's twins, right? I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before. Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio. I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby. Twins actually run in my family. It looks like we're about ready over here. Come on, Erica, start pushing again now. Ow! Here she comes! Yeah. Rachel? I. I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you. I. I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know. We're going to take Erica to recovery now. Oh my God, that's just like my name! Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler. Bye! Okay. Hey! Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but. Hey. I want one. Seriously. Wanna make one of those? Really? 18th and East End. Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare. Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number? What? Madame, your passport please? Your boarding pass, please. Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass. Madame, you must have your boarding pass. And the destination? Uhm, what was that? Okay, that doesn't sound good. But she is sometimes. Well, I can't take this plane now. Excuse me, sir, where are you going? I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange. What's wrong with the plane? There's nothing wrong with the plane. Yeah! The left Philange! There is no Philange! Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange! I'm not flying on it! Ma'am, please sit down! What's going on? We're all getting off. There is no Philange! Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine. And you fixed the Philange? Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case. Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass? I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass. Miss? Are you boarding the plane? Miss? Miss? Please, sit down! Miss, I can't let you off the plane. I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
