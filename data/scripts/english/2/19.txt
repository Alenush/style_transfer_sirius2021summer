ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hannibal Lecter better roommate than you.
НЕДРУГ: No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't realize that.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: GET OUT NOW!
НЕДРУГ: Ok, you really want me out?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes please.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I want you out.
НЕДРУГ: No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where did you hear it from before?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
НЕДРУГ: I heard that.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?
ДЖОУИ: Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
МОНИКА: A mirror?
ДЖОУИ: Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
МОНИКА: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from square one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
МОНИКА: Cache? Jaunty?
ДЖОУИ: Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
ФИБИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
МОНИКА: Oh my God, it was incredible.
ФИБИ: Didn't it like totally speak to you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
МОНИКА: Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
ФИБИ: Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Men just take out wind?
ФИБИ: Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
МОНИКА: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
ФИБИ: Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
МОНИКА: No.
ФИБИ: No, 'cause he's yummy.
МОНИКА: Yes. But all the other ones.
ФИБИ: Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
ДЖОУИ: Anybody want a croan.
ФИБИ: Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'
НЕДРУГ: Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
ДЖОУИ: So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
НЕДРУГ: Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
ДЖОУИ: No, can we get back to me?
НЕДРУГ: Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.
ДЖОУИ: Alright. Cab driver number two?
НЕДРУГ: You're welcome.
ДЖОУИ: But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
НЕДРУГ: Things change, roll with em.
ДЖОУИ: But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry. See ya.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.
МОНИКА: Isn't it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
ФИБИ: I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
РОСС: Hey you guys.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РОСС: Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: NO!
РОСС: No?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?
РОСС: Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.
МОНИКА: You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
РОСС: Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
РОСС: You, you know I, I don't, have a have a problem with that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.
ФИБИ: Um-um, um-um.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!
ДЖОУИ: What is it?
РОСС: I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
ДЖОУИ: See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
РОСС: What, what's that?
ДЖОУИ: It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
РОСС: Open it, open in.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God.
РОСС: Woah.
ДЖОУИ: Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
РОСС: Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh.
РОСС: What, woah, woah, 3500 at porcelain safari?
ДЖОУИ: My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
РОСС: Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: That audition.
ДЖОУИ: That's a two line part.
РОСС: Joey, you owe 1100 at I Love Lucite.
ДЖОУИ: So what.
РОСС: So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
РОСС: Toilet paper?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РОСС: Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
ДЖОУИ: Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
РОСС: I am your friend.
ДЖОУИ: Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
РОСС: But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe 2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
РОСС: Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
ДЖОУИ: Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
РОСС: Huh, I'm just saying.
ДЖОУИ: Well don't just say.
РОСС: Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
ДЖОУИ: Ok.
РОСС: Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
ДЖОУИ: I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?
НЕДРУГ: Hey pal.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
НЕДРУГ: Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
НЕДРУГ: Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time.
НЕДРУГ: Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your last roommate's kidney?
НЕДРУГ: That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
НЕДРУГ: Lemonade? You ok man?
ДЖОУИ: Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
ДЖОУИ: I fell down an elevator shaft.
НЕДРУГ: That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Daaahhhh!
МОНИКА: Aaahhhh! Aaahhhh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
МОНИКА: I wa.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uuuh.
НЕДРУГ: Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
НЕДРУГ: You, you want, you want me to move out?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You want some help.
НЕДРУГ: No help required Chico.
ДЖОУИ: All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Five oh dollars.
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.
НЕДРУГ: That's great.
ДЖОУИ: And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
ДЖОУИ: No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day.
ФИБИ: Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
МОНИКА: And I would have to say pah-huh.
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: Do you not remember the puppet guy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
МОНИКА: And his puppet too.
ФИБИ: Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
МОНИКА: Who?
ФИБИ: Paul.
МОНИКА: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
МОНИКА: Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not uh, not to my recollection.
МОНИКА: Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
ФИБИ: Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
МОНИКА: One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
РОСС: Oh my God, what's goin' on?
ДЖОУИ: They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
РОСС: No look I wasn't right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks Ross.
РОСС: Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
ДЖОУИ: I went.
РОСС: Great, how did it go?
ДЖОУИ: I didn't get it.
РОСС: Good for you.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: You're livin' the dream.
ДЖОУИ: Huh?
РОСС: All right then.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, not my parrot.
РОСС: What?
ДЖОУИ: I can't watch this.
РОСС: Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
НЕДРУГ: 1200.
РОСС: Dollars? You spent 1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
ДЖОУИ: Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
РОСС: Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, the dog.
РОСС: Huh.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: I'll take it. My gift to you man.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though. I'll take the dog though.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here are your cakes.
МОНИКА: We didn't order cake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.
МОНИКА: You're right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know.
ФИБИ: I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. So are we good?
МОНИКА: We're good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We're good?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
МОНИКА: Are you sure this time?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
НЕДРУГ: Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's.
МОНИКА: There is no alley behind Macy's.
НЕДРУГ: So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our next cocktail party?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
НЕДРУГ: Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, yes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what happened?
НЕДРУГ: We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh sweet Moses.
МОНИКА: So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
НЕДРУГ: Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh?
МОНИКА: Nice.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.
ФИБИ: Is anyone else starting to really like him?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Absolutely.
ДЖОУИ: What happened to the foosball?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah that's a cantelope.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
ДЖОУИ: He paid a lot of money for it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
