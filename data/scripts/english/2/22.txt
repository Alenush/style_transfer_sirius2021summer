НЕДРУГ: Moondance Diner. Ross, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are sitting at the counter, Monica is working. Monica is wearing her costume, including big fake breasts.
МОНИКА: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh.
МОНИКА: What?
РОСС: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
МОНИКА: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
РОСС: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
ДЖОУИ: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
РОСС: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
МОНИКА: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
МОНИКА: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
РОСС: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
МОНИКА: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
ДЖОУИ: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
ФИБИ: Why not her?
ДЖОУИ: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
МОНИКА: Joey that is horriable.
ДЖОУИ: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I didn't know.
ДЖОУИ: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
РОСС: Hi honey, how did it go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
МОНИКА: So what happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
ФИБИ: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
МОНИКА: Well, how bout just her mom?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why her mom?
МОНИКА: Cause I already invited her.
ФИБИ: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
ФИБИ: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
МОНИКА: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me?
МОНИКА: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
ДЖОУИ: Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
МОНИКА: Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
МОНИКА: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
МОНИКА: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
НЕДРУГ: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
НЕДРУГ: Hi Monica.
МОНИКА: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, basically just a Chinese guy.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
НЕДРУГ: Well, my goodness, what was that?
МОНИКА: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
НЕДРУГ: You thought I was Rachel?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes because uh, you look so young.
ФИБИ: And because you're both, you know, white women.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
НЕДРУГ: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons. The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was.
ФИБИ: Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so. Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
ДЖОУИ: Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
МОНИКА: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
МОНИКА: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
ДЖОУИ: Right this is staging.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
ДЖОУИ: This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
МОНИКА: Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I knew.
РОСС: All right.
МОНИКА: Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why.
МОНИКА: Just go.
НЕДРУГ: Surprise.
НЕДРУГ: Happy birthday sweetpea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Daddy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we could count again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe this is happening.
РОСС: You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do.
РОСС: That's who.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, are you gonna be ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, actually just one birthday flan.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert. Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
ДЖОУИ: Quick volleyball question.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Volleyball.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
НЕДРУГ: Dennis.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, that's me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
РОСС: Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
МОНИКА: Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
РОСС: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery. game?
НЕДРУГ: It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
РОСС: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
МОНИКА: Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
НЕДРУГ: I um, was sorta thinking about maybe.
МОНИКА: No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.

НЕДРУГ: I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
РОСС: No. no.
НЕДРУГ: Whad'ya mean no?
РОСС: No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
НЕДРУГ: Get my glasses too.
РОСС: All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
МОНИКА: Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
ФИБИ: Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
МОНИКА: What? I don't see anything.
ФИБИ: Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, whose glasses are those?
РОСС: Mine.
НЕДРУГ: You wear bi-focals?
РОСС: Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
НЕДРУГ: Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well those are very popular frames.
РОСС: Neil Sedaka wears them.
НЕДРУГ: I hear you can get people out of here.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, like a chimney.
РОСС: Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
НЕДРУГ: Are you wearing my glasses?
РОСС: Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
РОСС: Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
ФИБИ: Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
НЕДРУГ: What about my friend Victor?
ФИБИ: No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, let me just get my coat.
ФИБИ: There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
НЕДРУГ: Is it true they have beer?
ФИБИ: Everything you've heard is true.
МОНИКА: Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
МОНИКА: You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Um.
ФИБИ: Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
МОНИКА: Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
МОНИКА: Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You want me to see a therapist?
НЕДРУГ: Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
НЕДРУГ: Did you know your mother spent 1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
НЕДРУГ: You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
НЕДРУГ: You work and you work and you work on a boat.
НЕДРУГ: He always ridiculed my pottery classs.
НЕДРУГ: and you sand it and you varnish it.
НЕДРУГ: but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
НЕДРУГ: and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County.
НЕДРУГ: the scotch and the cigarettes.
НЕДРУГ: and the bansai's and the chiuaua.
НЕДРУГ: I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but.
НЕДРУГ: what the hell does she want with half a boat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I, I know.
МОНИКА: Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
МОНИКА: Ok will do. So glad you came.
НЕДРУГ: I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
МОНИКА: Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh ok.
НЕДРУГ: Happy birthday sweetie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh, you drive safe.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, what're you doing.
РОСС: I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
НЕДРУГ: To get my coat.
НЕДРУГ: No no no.
НЕДРУГ:Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
ФИБИ: Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
НЕДРУГ: I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
ФИБИ: Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
МОНИКА: Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
ДЖОУИ: Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
МОНИКА: Ok, that's enough.
ФИБИ: Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
