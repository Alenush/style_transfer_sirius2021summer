РОСС: Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: So how did everything go? 
РОСС: Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, we've gotta go. 
РОСС: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. 
РОСС: Oh, you and me? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, no, Susan and me. 
НЕДРУГ: The other us. 
РОСС: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: We're uh, we're getting married. 
РОСС: As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married? 
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to. 
РОСС: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding. 
НЕДРУГ: Look I just thought that... 
РОСС: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me! 
НЕДРУГ: Is your finger caught in that chair? 
РОСС: Mmm hmmm. 
НЕДРУГ: Want us to go? 
РОСС: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television. 
ДЖОУИ: It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.. 
МОНИКА: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! 
МОНИКА: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it? 
РОСС: Would it matter? 
МОНИКА: Oh, you are so great! Thank you! 
ДЖОУИ: Are you really not going? 
РОСС: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married? 
МОНИКА: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. 
РОСС: If you wanna call that a reason. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor. 
МОНИКА: Ross, I thought you were over this. 
РОСС: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did I miss it? Did I miss it? 
ДЖОУИ: No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa, she's pretty. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, what? 
МОНИКА: What? 
ДЖОУИ: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, ok. 
ДЖОУИ: There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. 
НЕДРУГ: Is she gonna be all right? 
ДЖОУИ: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's great! 
РОСС: Excellent! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. 
РОСС: That is so good! Do it again! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!" 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. 
РОСС: No no, that's me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah. 
РОСС: Oh, hello. 
ФИБИ: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh... 
РОСС: Is everything ok? 
ФИБИ: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. 
РОСС: Oh my god. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman. 
МОНИКА: Oh, honey. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you mean? 
ФИБИ: I think it went into me. 
МОНИКА: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, who ordered what? 
РОСС: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god. 
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know? 
ФИБИ: Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? 
ФИБИ: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up! 
НЕДРУГ: There she is. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mom! 
НЕДРУГ: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pretty much. 
НЕДРУГ: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh hello, Ross. 
РОСС: Hi, Mrs. Green. 
НЕДРУГ: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Mom! 
НЕДРУГ: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Believe me, sometimes that happens. 
НЕДРУГ: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. 
ФИБИ: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales. 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer? 
ФИБИ: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. 
НЕДРУГ: You have some life here, sweetie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? 
НЕДРУГ: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For...me. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, not just for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm uh, considering leaving your father. 
МОНИКА: All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick. 
МОНИКА: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. 
РОСС: And you had no idea they weren't getting along? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: None. 
ДЖОУИ: They didn't fight a lot? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? 
ФИБИ: In my day, divorce was not an option. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, look who's up. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this. 
МОНИКА: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true. 
ФИБИ: That's him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting. 
ФИБИ: Um, do you wanna sit? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear? 
ФИБИ: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. 
НЕДРУГ: You're saying, my wife is in you? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything. 
ФИБИ: Everything? 
НЕДРУГ: Everything. 
ФИБИ: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. 
НЕДРУГ: Worth a shot, huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Look at this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: These are from Halloween three years ago. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. 
МОНИКА: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen." 
МОНИКА: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Mon, you want some help? 
МОНИКА: If you want. 
ФИБИ: Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's still with you? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face. 
НЕДРУГ: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God! 
МОНИКА: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. 
НЕДРУГ: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! What's new in sex? 
НЕДРУГ: The only man I've ever been with is your father. 
МОНИКА: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You want me to talk you out of it? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then what? What do you want? 
НЕДРУГ: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why on earth would I understand this? 
НЕДРУГ: You didn't marry your Barry. I did. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. 
МОНИКА: Joey, speed it up! 
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! 
ФИБИ: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out. 
МОНИКА: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry? 
ФИБИ: Sir! No sir! 
МОНИКА: All right, you! 
РОСС: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. 
МОНИКА: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: How's it going? 
МОНИКА: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. 
НЕДРУГ: Fine, whatever. 
РОСС: What's the matter? 
НЕДРУГ: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. 
РОСС: What? 
МОНИКА: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. 
РОСС: Carol, what's the matter? What happened? 
НЕДРУГ: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. 
РОСС: Oh my god. 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. 
РОСС: It's ok. I'm sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do. 
РОСС: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right. 
НЕДРУГ: You do? 
РОСС: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this. 
НЕДРУГ: Of course I do. 
РОСС: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it. 
НЕДРУГ: You're right. Of course you're right. 
МОНИКА: So we're back on? 
НЕДРУГ: We're back on. 
МОНИКА: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes. 
ДЖОУИ: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. 
ФИБИ: Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
РОСС: Any time. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. 
ФИБИ: Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. 
МОНИКА: Would you look at them? 
РОСС: Yeah, can't help but. 
ДЖОУИ: How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. 
ФИБИ: I miss Rose. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah? 
ФИБИ: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink? 
ФИБИ: Ok, that's so nice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Mom? Having fun? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There's more alcohol, right? 
НЕДРУГ: How you doin'? 
РОСС: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: You did a good thing today. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: You wanna dance? 
РОСС: No, that's fine. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on. I'll let you lead. 
РОСС: Ok. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. 
МОНИКА: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married? 
РОСС: Well, Mon, I was married. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, me, too, technically. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I had a wedding. 
МОНИКА: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion. 
ДЖОУИ: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Isn't Ben in this? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah!
