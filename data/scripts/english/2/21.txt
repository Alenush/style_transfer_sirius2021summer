ДЖОУИ: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel? 
МОНИКА: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok honey, you really need a job. 
РОСС: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview. 
МОНИКА: Really. 
ФИБИ: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there. 
РОСС: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh. 
ФИБИ: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh. 
ФИБИ: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. 
МОНИКА: His indian name? 
ФИБИ: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so. 
РОСС: Freakish. 
МОНИКА: Wow. 
ДЖОУИ: Freaky. 
МОНИКА: Weird, weird. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger? 
ФИБИ: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him. 
МОНИКА: Why? 
ФИБИ: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, I am so beat. 
РОСС: Oh yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here? 
РОСС: Yeah alright. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey you're in our seats. 
РОСС: Oh, sorry we didn't know. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, we were sitting there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it? 
НЕДРУГ: Is that supposed to be funny? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No actually, I was just going for colorful. 
НЕДРУГ: What's with this guy? 
НЕДРУГ: What's with you? 
РОСС: Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What just happened? 
НЕДРУГ: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That, that is funny. Can I have it back? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РОСС: Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat. 
НЕДРУГ: Why should we? 
РОСС: Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat? 
НЕДРУГ: You got a problem with that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, how'd the interview go? 
МОНИКА: It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So don't do it. 
МОНИКА: How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank. 
ДЖОУИ: Monica, relax, go get a beer. 
МОНИКА: I don't want a beer. 
ДЖОУИ: Who said it was for you? 
НЕДРУГ: Hhhiiii. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's the matter with you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo. 
ДЖОУИ: You're kiddin'. 
РОСС: It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oohhh. 
РОСС: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now. 
МОНИКА: Hey, I went up. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it. 
ДЖОУИ: Do what? 
МОНИКА: Put all my money in me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market. 
МОНИКА: What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock... selling store. 
ДЖОУИ: See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea? 
ФИБИ: Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We love you, we're here for you. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah good luck, good luck. 
ФИБИ: Thanks. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, what is in that? 
ДЖОУИ: Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross. 
ФИБИ: Hey, hey, no, oh oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Run Phoebe run. 
ФИБИ: No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no. 
ДЖОУИ: Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you kidding me? 
ФИБИ: Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem. 
ДЖОУИ: Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, here, I know what we can do. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, hey no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say? 
ДЖОУИ: Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will. 
ФИБИ: Are you crazy? 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets? 
РОСС: Do you say this stuff to girls? 
НЕДРУГ: Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat? 
НЕДРУГ: And look where they're sitting. 
РОСС: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door. 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe we didn't make it clear enough. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: This couch belongs to us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to. 
НЕДРУГ: You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here. 
РОСС: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat. 
НЕДРУГ: Fellas, these guys were here first. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: There you go. 
РОСС: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that. 
НЕДРУГ: He told on us? 
НЕДРУГ: You told on us? 
РОСС: Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't play with his things. 
РОСС: I know. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, let's take this outside. 
РОСС: Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that? 
НЕДРУГ: The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You had to ask. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РОСС: Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think you played the Gunther card too soon. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's the matter? 
ФИБИ: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home? 
ФИБИ: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again 
ФИБИ: What was that? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now. 
МОНИКА: I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Time is money my friend? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.' 
МОНИКА: Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done? 
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How did you make $17. 
МОНИКА: Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY. 
ДЖОУИ: How come those? 
МОНИКА: Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What happened to uh, MEG.? 
МОНИКА: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down. 
ДЖОУИ: That is so not my motto. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog? 
ФИБИ: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow. 
ДЖОУИ: Good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank God. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok? 
ФИБИ: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.' 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it. 
ФИБИ: Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. 
МОНИКА: DON'T...be too long with the phone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She'll be a much better friend when the market closes. 
ДЖОУИ: It's a woman. 
ФИБИ: So talk to her. 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why the voice. 
ДЖОУИ: Hard to say. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your cappucino sir. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house. 
РОСС: Absolutely. 
РОСС: How come it's not mixing with the water? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР:Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. 
РОСС: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No? 
РОСС: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, hang on a second there Custer. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? 
РОСС: Yeah, sure. 
ДЖОУИ: By someone besides Monica? 
РОСС: No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back. 
МОНИКА: I need to borrow a hundred bucks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For what? 
МОНИКА: I've gotta get back in the game. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, when did you get out of the game? 
МОНИКА: I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no. 
МОНИКА: Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I, I don't have it. 
МОНИКА: But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nobody does honey. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog? 
ФИБИ: It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian. 
НЕДРУГ: What are these, stitches? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him. 
ФИБИ: Sure, oh, is, is Frank home. 
НЕДРУГ: How do you know Frank? 
ФИБИ: Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Frank. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. What? 
ФИБИ: Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior. 
НЕДРУГ: He went out for groceries. 
ФИБИ: Ok so will he be back soon? 
НЕДРУГ: Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now. 
ФИБИ: Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad? 
ФИБИ: Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too. 
НЕДРУГ: Heavy. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe? 
НЕДРУГ: No but he didn't really talk about anything. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Except stilts. 
ФИБИ: Stilts? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts. 
ФИБИ: Wow. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: I don't know what to do with that. 
НЕДРУГ: Me neither. So you're like my big sister. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: This is huge, you can buy me beer. 
ФИБИ: I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.' 
НЕДРУГ: I gotta friend named Mark. 
ФИБИ: That'll work too. 
НЕДРУГ: Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, that'd be ok. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright. 
ФИБИ: Ok, I'm in the book. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, yeah. 
ФИБИ: Alright. So um, stilts huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter. 
ФИБИ: Ok. 
РОСС: Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you come on! Come on! Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, there we go. 
РОСС: I think we proved our point. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You burn your mouth? 
РОСС: Cannot feel my tounge. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bullies, big bullies. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies. 
НЕДРУГ: Did we not make ourselves clear the other day. 
РОСС: Yes, and that's why we're here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently. 
НЕДРУГ: Let's do this alright. 
РОСС: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon? 
НЕДРУГ: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, let's do this. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon? 
РОСС: Whad'ya mean? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it. 
НЕДРУГ: No, you can't use your watch. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: Or your keys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this. 
РОСС: Before I forget, are we hitting faces? 
НЕДРУГ: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces? 
РОСС: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation. 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh really, you guys tryin' again? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle? 
НЕДРУГ: C'MON! 
РОСС: Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! 
РОСС: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РОСС: God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.

РОСС: Yeah he was wasn't he. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything. 
НЕДРУГ: Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope. 
РОСС: So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here? 
НЕДРУГ: We're ok. 
РОСС: Alright. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok so, can I have my hat back? 
НЕДРУГ: No.
