ФИБИ: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad. 
МОНИКА: Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And twenty-five it is. 
ДЖОУИ: You gave him cookies? 
МОНИКА: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that. 
ФИБИ: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies? 
ФИБИ: Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them. 
РОСС: So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, the mailman, the super. 
МОНИКА: Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section. 
МОНИКА: Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle. 
РОСС: Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme. 
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year. 
РОСС: Hey guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me? 
РОСС: How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Here, go nuts. 
РОСС: Hey guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's in the bag? 
РОСС: Um, just some presents. 
ДЖОУИ: C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to. 
РОСС: OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh. 
МОНИКА: Cute. 
РОСС: I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom. 
МОНИКА: Ross, that is gorgeous! 
РОСС: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Hi Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this? 
РОСС: Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings. 
ФИБИ: This is my father, this is a picture of my dad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. 
ФИБИ: No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison. 
ФИБИ: No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How have you never been on Oprah? 
ФИБИ: OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy. 
МОНИКА: Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. 
ФИБИ: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. 
МОНИКА: Oh, wait a minute honey. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebs. 
МОНИКА: Wow. 
ДЖОУИ: So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . . 
НЕДРУГ: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears! 
НЕДРУГ: Esther Livingston. Gone. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Phoe. 
ФИБИ: Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, just updating the phonebook. 
ФИБИ: Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come? 
ФИБИ: Just, you know, to see... um. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation. 
ФИБИ: OK, is this really my father? 
НЕДРУГ: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is. 
ФИБИ: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, I. . . 
ФИБИ: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. 
ФИБИ: Oh God. 
НЕДРУГ: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder. 
ФИБИ: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones? 
НЕДРУГ: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. 
ФИБИ: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? 
НЕДРУГ: Honey. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who said anything about Christmas? 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
РОСС: Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, nothin'. 
МОНИКА: I hope she's OK. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through. 
МОНИКА: How do you know exactly what she's going through? 
ДЖОУИ: She told us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So whaddya got there Monica? 
МОНИКА: Just some stuff for the party. 
РОСС: Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping? 
МОНИКА: You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. 
МОНИКА: Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough. 
ДЖОУИ: Monica, pigeons learn faster that you. 
РОСС: Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . . 
РОСС: C'mon Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. 
РОСС: See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name. 
НЕДРУГ: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going? 
ФИБИ: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin. 
ФИБИ: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know. 
НЕДРУГ: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived. 
ФИБИ: Whattaya mean? 
НЕДРУГ: He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab. 
ФИБИ: Wow. Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe here with the cab yet? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in. 
ДЖОУИ: Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, here she comes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eeeshk. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, big stuff. 
ФИБИ: OK, let's go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK. 
ФИБИ: Alright, here, you have to hold this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK. Brake left, gas right? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's my seat belt? 
ФИБИ: Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: C'mon, just tell me, please, please. 
МОНИКА: For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, gosh, it's hot in here. 
МОНИКА: Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please? 
РОСС: Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . . 
МОНИКА: Ross, the heat! 
РОСС: Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you just break the radiator? 
РОСС: No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is. 
МОНИКА: Well put it back. 
РОСС: It uhh, it won't go back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'll call the super. 
МОНИКА: Here, let me try. 
РОСС: Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal. 
МОНИКА: Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? What, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight. 
РОСС: OK, tip the man. 
МОНИКА: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party. 
РОСС: Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, this is it, 74. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so that's what this is for. 
ФИБИ: Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure is. 
ФИБИ: OK, here I go. I'm goin' in. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright. 
ДЖОУИ: Good luck Phoebs. 
ФИБИ: OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom. 
РОСС: It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much? 
МОНИКА: Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright. 
РОСС: Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK. 
МОНИКА: Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mr. Treeger. 
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, you said there was a party. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese! 
РОСС: Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything. 
МОНИКА: No, I will not cave. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I'm with Mon. 
РОСС: Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back. 
РОСС: No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now? 
НЕДРУГ: No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday. 
МОНИКА: Ross. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Looks like he's playin' baseball. 
РОСС: You mean hardball? 
МОНИКА: Whatever. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What'cha gonna' do? 
РОСС: Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting? 
НЕДРУГ: No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right. 
МОНИКА: So, wait, you really did like my cookies? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nice seizing. . . gel boy. 
НЕДРУГ: So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil. 
ФИБИ: OK. 
ДЖОУИ: How far'd ya get? 
ФИБИ: Mailbox. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, we're gettin' closer. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebs, what's goin' on? 
ФИБИ: No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . . 
ДЖОУИ: Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, so why not go knock? 
ФИБИ: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one. 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today. 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you. 
ФИБИ: You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here! 
ДЖОУИ: Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down? 
МОНИКА: Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier. 
РОСС: Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I couldn't go in. 
МОНИКА: Honey, I'm sorry. 
РОСС: Are you OK? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright. 
ДЖОУИ: Rach, these are for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car. 
ДЖОУИ: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, Phoebs, your turn. 
ФИБИ: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh. 
ФИБИ: You guuuyys. 
ДЖОУИ: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. 
РОСС: You got me a cola drink? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And, a lemon lime. 
РОСС: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And last but not least. 
ДЖОУИ: They're ribbed for your pleasure.
