РОСС: Man, I sure miss Julie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
РОСС: You ever figure out what that thing's for?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
НЕДРУГ: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
НЕДРУГ: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had the nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: I got a little drunk and naked.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bob here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What've you been up to?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
РОСС: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm back.
НЕДРУГ: So, are we gonna get together or what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
НЕДРУГ: Great, I'll see you then.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
РОСС: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
РОСС: Oh my god. You are pure evil.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Julie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, Julie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
ФИБИ: Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
ДЖОУИ: Do we need a cake?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, whoosh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But it's Ross.
ФИБИ: It's Ross.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll see you guys later, I gotta go do a thing.
РОСС: Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I think I might just.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
ДЖОУИ: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
ФИБИ: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying let's go here, let's go there. Like we can afford to go here and there.
ФИБИ: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
ДЖОУИ: For Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For Ross, Ross, Ross.
МОНИКА: Oh my god.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
ДЖОУИ: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
МОНИКА: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
РОСС: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
РОСС: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
РОСС: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right.
РОСС: Go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
НЕДРУГ: Yes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
НЕДРУГ: How did you-?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
РОСС: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef-.
МОНИКА: Who is also in charge of purchasing.
РОСС: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing.
МОНИКА: Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
РОСС: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister.
МОНИКА: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
ДЖОУИ: Cool.
ФИБИ: Let's see!
РОСС: That's fine, I'll just wait!
МОНИКА: Oh, sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Sorry, sorry.
РОСС: Monica!
НЕДРУГ: Are we ready to order?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
НЕДРУГ: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
ФИБИ: Wow, look at these prices.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
ДЖОУИ: What are these, like famous chickens?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
РОСС: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
РОСС: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
НЕДРУГ: Do I dare ask?
МОНИКА: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
РОСС: That sounds great. Same for me.
НЕДРУГ: And for the gentleman?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
НЕДРУГ: You'd think, wouldn't you?. Miss?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
НЕДРУГ: And what will that be on the side of?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
НЕДРУГ: And for you?
ФИБИ: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
НЕДРУГ: Anything else?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
РОСС: Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, everyone?
РОСС: Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you.
РОСС: Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
МОНИКА: Oh, thank you!
РОСС: So five of us is, 33.50 apiece.
ФИБИ: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just.
РОСС: Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
ФИБИ: Not for you.
МОНИКА: All right, what's goin' on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
ФИБИ: Fine. All right, fine.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can tell us.
РОСС: Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
МОНИКА: Ok.
РОСС: I hear ya.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We can talk about that.
ФИБИ: Well, then. Let's.
РОСС: I, I just never think of money as an issue.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's 'cause you have it.
РОСС: That's a good point.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
ДЖОУИ: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
РОСС: Wha-? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative-there's gonna be a hoopla?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
МОНИКА: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
РОСС: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
РОСС: Hootie and the-oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
ФИБИ: No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
РОСС: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
МОНИКА: All of us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Together.
РОСС: Not at the concert.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
МОНИКА: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
ФИБИ: Oh, it's like a skit.
МОНИКА: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
РОСС: Whoo!
ФИБИ: Cool.
МОНИКА: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
РОСС: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
РОСС: Come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
МОНИКА: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
ФИБИ: So. Thank you.
РОСС: Could you be less enthused?
ДЖОУИ: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like.
МОНИКА: Like?
ДЖОУИ: Charity.
МОНИКА: Charity?
РОСС: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
ФИБИ: Actually, it makes us feel that big.
РОСС: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
ФИБИ: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me neither.
ДЖОУИ: Me too.
МОНИКА: Guys, we bought the tickets.
ФИБИ: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why did you look at me when you said that?
МОНИКА: Well, I guess now we can't go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
МОНИКА: You know what? You're right.
ФИБИ: Fine.
РОСС: Fine.
ДЖОУИ: Fine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine.
МОНИКА: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
РОСС: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
РОСС: Geez! Are you ready?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
РОСС: Whoa! You had sex today?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
РОСС: Wow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
РОСС: Still doing the screening thing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
НЕДРУГ: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bob here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, uh, you met someone, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, uh, how was he?
НЕДРУГ: Eh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that makes me feel so good.
НЕДРУГ: It was just so awkward and bumpy.
РОСС: Bumpy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
НЕДРУГ: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
МОНИКА: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
РОСС: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, let's go.
РОСС: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
МОНИКА: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
ДЖОУИ: Come on you guys, one more time.
ФИБИ: Ok. One.
ДЖОУИ: Nooo.
МОНИКА: That was amazing!
РОСС: Excellent, that was excellent.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe the guys missed this.
РОСС: What guys? Oh, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
МОНИКА: Do I know you?
НЕДРУГ: You used to be my babysitter.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
НЕДРУГ: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
МОНИКА: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
НЕДРУГ: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
МОНИКА: Uh, wait, backstage?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
РОСС: Ross.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler.
НЕДРУГ: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
РОСС: Hey, you guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Happy birthday.
РОСС: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
МОНИКА: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
МОНИКА: Uh, good.
РОСС: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we really missed you guys.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
ФИБИ: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get-is that a hickey?
МОНИКА: No, I just, I fell down.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
МОНИКА: You know, a party, or.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What party?
РОСС: It wasn't so much a party as a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
ДЖОУИ: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who gave you that hickey?
МОНИКА: That would be the work of a Blowfish.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ФИБИ: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck.
РОСС: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
МОНИКА: It's work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
ДЖОУИ: And we don't work hard?
МОНИКА: Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
ДЖОУИ: And you feel like we hold you back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
МОНИКА: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.
ДЖОУИ: Let me get that. You got five bucks?
НЕДРУГ: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night.
