ЧЕНДЛЕР: I so am. 
ДЖОУИ: You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, this all looks good. 
МОНИКА: Great. 
НЕДРУГ: And if I want to call for a reference on your last job? 
МОНИКА: Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad. 
МОНИКА: A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like. 
НЕДРУГ: No, just a salad will be fine. 
МОНИКА: You got it. 
НЕДРУГ: Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it. 
МОНИКА: Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. Is it dirty? 
МОНИКА: Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it. 
НЕДРУГ: Don't, I like it dirty. 
МОНИКА: That's your call. 
НЕДРУГ: So, uh, what are you going to do next? 
МОНИКА: Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos. 
НЕДРУГ: Are they, uh, firm? 
МОНИКА: They'r alright. 
НЕДРУГ: You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad? 
МОНИКА: No really, they're OK.

МОНИКА: Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne. 
НЕДРУГ: Aaaahhhhhhh. 
МОНИКА: I'm outa here. 
РОСС: Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey? 
ФИБИ: Oh, some guy she met at the movies. 
РОСС: Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight. 
РОСС: I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service. 
ФИБИ: Hang in there, it's gonna happen. 
РОСС: Wha, OK, now how do you know that? 
ФИБИ: Because she's your lobster. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, she's goin' somewhere. 
ФИБИ: C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you feelin' better? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me. 
ФИБИ: So, do you have any other possibilities? 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent. 
РОСС: Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money. 
МОНИКА: No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you. 
РОСС: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ya know, the man's got a point. 
ФИБИ: What is that sparkly thing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy. 
РОСС: No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella. 
МОНИКА: Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi darling. 
МОНИКА: So, what's this. 
НЕДРУГ: Some of your old stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym. 
МОНИКА: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room? 
НЕДРУГ: Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them. 
МОНИКА: Oh, God forbid. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what incident? 
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. 
ФИБИ: Do you want a refill? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I'm alright, thanks. 
ФИБИ: OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Gail. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap. 
ФИБИ: It's not that bad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. 
ФИБИ: Chandler, Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good. 
РОСС: Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha. 
ФИБИ: I think she's OK. 
РОСС: Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you, what are you doin'? 
РОСС: Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care. 
РОСС: OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: I was saving you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me? 
РОСС: Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save. 
РОСС: But, you are. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again? 
РОСС: No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing? 
ФИБИ: Do the claws again. 
РОСС: Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, there is no us, OK. 
РОСС: No, but. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it. 
РОСС: Well, but, but. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that. 
РОСС: E-except, except that what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, ACC-cept that. 
РОСС: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad. 
ДЖОУИ: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. 
ДЖОУИ: You know what the. . . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . 
НЕДРУГ: You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there. 
РОСС: Hey guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him? 
РОСС: No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today. 
НЕДРУГ: A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. 
МОНИКА: Where have you been? 
РОСС: Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet? 
МОНИКА: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet. 
РОСС: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news. 
МОНИКА: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
МОНИКА: Because they made me. 
НЕДРУГ: You were fired? What're you gonna do? 
НЕДРУГ: Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go? 
НЕДРУГ: In the bank. 
НЕДРУГ: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. 
МОНИКА: Anything larger back there? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe it. 
ФИБИ: Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? 
ФИБИ: Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What am I gonna do, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: How come you have two? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well this one's for you. 
ДЖОУИ: Get out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what they'll call us. 
РОСС: Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like. 
МОНИКА: You have dinosaur checks? 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that? 
МОНИКА: Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful. 
ФИБИ: Hey, Mon, what is this? 
МОНИКА: Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Monica, what's on this video tape? 
МОНИКА: Hey, you got me, put it in. 
РОСС: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
РОСС: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
ДЖОУИ: What is with your nose? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut. 
МОНИКА: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
РОСС: You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah we do. C'mon. 
НЕДРУГ: Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica. 
МОНИКА: Over here dad. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is. 
ДЖОУИ: Some girl ate Monica. 
МОНИКА: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you? 
МОНИКА: Oh, you look so great. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh, so do you, beautiful. 
МОНИКА: Oops. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress. 
НЕДРУГ: Everybody smile. 
МОНИКА: Oh, dad, turn it off. 
НЕДРУГ: It is off. 
МОНИКА: Dad, it is not. What's with the red light? 
НЕДРУГ: It's the off light. Right Ross? 
ДЖОУИ: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter. 
РОСС: You look pretty tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer? 
РОСС: Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . . 
РОСС: Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, the guys are here. 
РОСС: this summer? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Work on your music?

МОНИКА: Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet? 
НЕДРУГ: He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. 
МОНИКА: I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late. 
МОНИКА: If you're not going then I don't want to go either. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass. 
НЕДРУГ: I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom. 
РОСС: Doubtful. 
НЕДРУГ: Jack, give me that. Talk to your son. 
НЕДРУГ: Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux. 
РОСС: Dad, she won't want to go with me. 
НЕДРУГ: Of course she would, you're a college man. 
РОСС: I don't know. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh. 
РОСС: OK. Hold my board. 
НЕДРУГ: Atta boy. 
РОСС: OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.

НЕДРУГ: The button, the button. 
МОНИКА: I can't believe you did that. 
РОСС: Yeah, well. 
ФИБИ: See, he's her lobster. 
НЕДРУГ: Dance with him. 
МОНИКА: Mom, I'm hungry. 
НЕДРУГ: Dance with your father. 
НЕДРУГ: I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor. 
МОНИКА: Alright.
