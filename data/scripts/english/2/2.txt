НЕДРУГ: Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
ФИБИ: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it's something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
ДЖОУИ: I gotta get one, too.
РОСС: What are you guys doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
РОСС: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
РОСС: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, does it hurt?
НЕДРУГ: It did at first, but not anymore.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, uh, how often can you do it?
НЕДРУГ: As much as he needs.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I forget which ones.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. What a bitch.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdales who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
ФИБИ: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
МОНИКА: Ok, um, I'll go with you.
НЕДРУГ: Great.
РОСС: Hi, honey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, sweetums.
РОСС: Hello to the rest.
ДЖОУИ: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
МОНИКА: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
МОНИКА: But I'm.
ФИБИ: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
РОСС: So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
МОНИКА: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
РОСС: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
МОНИКА: You're welcome.
ФИБИ: Woof, woof.
ДЖОУИ: Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
ДЖОУИ: Who?
НЕДРУГ: Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
ДЖОУИ: What's he doin' in my section?
НЕДРУГ: I guess he doesn't know.
ДЖОУИ: Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
НЕДРУГ: Mornin'.
ДЖОУИ: Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
НЕДРУГ: Your territory, huh?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Bijan for men?
НЕДРУГ: No thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Hombre?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. All right.
НЕДРУГ: You were saying?
МОНИКА: Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: We were shopping, and we had lunch.
ФИБИ: Oh, all right. What did I have?
МОНИКА: You had a salad.
ФИБИ: Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, guys, what's up.
ФИБИ: I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
ФИБИ: Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You went shopping for fur?
ФИБИ: Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You bought boobs?
ФИБИ: Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
ДЖОУИ: Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
НЕДРУГ: Ready, Annabelle?
НЕДРУГ: You bet. Maybe some other time?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?
НЕДРУГ: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
РОСС: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
НЕДРУГ: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, this is so cute.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I got that for him.
РОСС: My mommies love me. That's clever.
МОНИКА: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you just say Hi, Jew?
МОНИКА: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
ФИБИ: Ben, dinner!
РОСС: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
ФИБИ: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did you just do?
ФИБИ: I licked my arm, what?
РОСС: It's breast milk.
ФИБИ: So?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
ДЖОУИ: What is the big deal?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did you just do?
РОСС: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
ФИБИ: You won't even taste it?
РОСС: No!
ФИБИ: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
РОСС: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
МОНИКА: Hey, where is everybody?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
МОНИКА: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
МОНИКА: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket.
МОНИКА: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
МОНИКА: Judy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who?
МОНИКА: Julie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: Jody.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were with Julie?
МОНИКА: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were shopping.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh my god.
МОНИКА: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, right.
МОНИКА: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
МОНИКА: That is not true!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
МОНИКА: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
МОНИКА: Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
НЕДРУГ: How did we do?
ФИБИ: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
РОСС: I did not freak out.
НЕДРУГ: Why'd you freak out?
РОСС: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
НЕДРУГ: My breast milk is gross?
НЕДРУГ: This should be fun.
РОСС: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
РОСС: That would be no.
ФИБИ: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh.
НЕДРУГ: Cantaloupe juice.
ДЖОУИ: Exactly.
РОСС: You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
НЕДРУГ: Uh huh.
РОСС: Oh, you've tasted it.
НЕДРУГ: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
РОСС: Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Howdy.
ДЖОУИ: Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
ДЖОУИ: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
ДЖОУИ: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah I guess you're right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
ДЖОУИ: I'm gonna do it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
МОНИКА: I don't know what else to say.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
МОНИКА: I feel terrible, I really do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
МОНИКА: Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes.
МОНИКА: It's that terrible?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.
МОНИКА: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my. We're, we're. Oh, I love you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I love you too.
ФИБИ: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
МОНИКА: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'd do anything for you, you know that.
МОНИКА: I'd do anything for you.
ФИБИ: Wait, wait, wait, wait!
ДЖОУИ: Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
НЕДРУГ: I heard ya.
НЕДРУГ: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
НЕДРУГ: Ready.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I'm ready.
НЕДРУГ: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
НЕДРУГ: My god, what happened?
ДЖОУИ: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
НЕДРУГ: So.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
НЕДРУГ: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Me?
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you're not totally paranoid.
НЕДРУГ: Oy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
НЕДРУГ: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.
