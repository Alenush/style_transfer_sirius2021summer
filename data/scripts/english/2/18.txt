ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebs, play with meeee.
ФИБИ: No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh hello, human-rights violation. CHANDLER: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women an everybody has a pretty good time. PHOEBE: Why don't you play with your roommate?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
ФИБИ: Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room. PHOEBE: Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?CHANDLER: We don't need to remedy that.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
НЕДРУГ: What was that?
ФИБИ: Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other. EDDIE: Yeah alright, that sounds alright.

ФИБИ: I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?EDDIE: That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia. EDDIE: That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh. CHANDLER: Well it's not Sean Penn.
НЕДРУГ: Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, an I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and sh says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't wan to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reache into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all ove my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredibl abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh wasn't such a funny story, was it?
ФИБИ: And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night. RICHARD: Phoebe's got another job, right?

МОНИКА: Well, maybe you don't need them.
РОСС: My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
МОНИКА: Shut up, I'm happy.
ФИБИ: Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, an that is a lot, I like you the best. RICHARD: Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.

ДЖОУИ: Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
ФИБИ: Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
ДЖОУИ: Page 42, page 42, page 42.
ФИБИ: Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture. JOEY: Ooh, I look good.
ФИБИ: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't ge this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it 'If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me loo good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writer look good so how could they be mad about that?
НЕДРУГ: Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed JOEY: I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?DELIVERY GUY: Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
ДЖОУИ: They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
НЕДРУГ: Right. Could you sign this?
ДЖОУИ: No. No way, I'm not signing that.
НЕДРУГ: I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
ДЖОУИ: How can they do this to me?
НЕДРУГ: Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
МОНИКА: Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage. RACHEL: Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
РОСС: G'night.
НЕДРУГ: Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
МОНИКА: Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with. RICHARD: Two.
МОНИКА: Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two. MONICA: Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
НЕДРУГ: Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark. MONICA: Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
РОСС: Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhhhooo.
РОСС: C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there's you.
РОСС: Better not be doin' these in order.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
РОСС: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him. ROSS: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. CHANDLER: Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
НЕДРУГ: That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say. CHANDLER: This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story. EDDIE: Where's Buddy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Buddy?
НЕДРУГ: My fish, Buddy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There was no fish when she dropped it off.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lyin about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?CHANDLER: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy rightoff ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the.
НЕДРУГ: That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
МОНИКА: Well yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet. MONICA: You really ok with it?
НЕДРУГ: Oh honey, I'm fine.
МОНИКА: Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
НЕДРУГ: What? Alright, what about my two?
МОНИКА: Well, it just seems like a really small number.
НЕДРУГ: Right, and.
МОНИКА: And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?RICHARD: Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with wome I've been in love with. MONICA: But you've only slept with two people.
НЕДРУГ: Right.
МОНИКА: Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
НЕДРУГ: Now I do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you'r loving, you make me laugh. ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'l just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes. RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was. ROSS: Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even not even like, like chipmunk sex?RACHEL: Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo. ROSS: Knock-knock.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear this is the best I have ever had. ROSS: Until now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi.
МОНИКА: Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, honey that's great.
МОНИКА: I know. I just can't find.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
МОНИКА: You need one too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooooh yeah.
МОНИКА: There's only one.
НЕДРУГ: Monica.
МОНИКА: Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. ROSS: Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
РОСС: Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?RICHARD: No.
РОСС: Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
НЕДРУГ: I have a little comb.
РОСС: Oh. And what do you call that?
НЕДРУГ: A moustache comb.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
МОНИКА: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months. MONICA: Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan. RACHEL: Agghhh.
РОСС: So were you in Nam?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rock-paper-scissors?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: One two three.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeesss.
МОНИКА: Fine, go have sex.
НЕДРУГ: No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn' feel his legs. ROSS: No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was. RACHEL: Honey.
РОСС: What, what oh.
НЕДРУГ: Shall we?
МОНИКА: It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow. RICHARD: Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand. CHANDLER: So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. MONICA: Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. PHOEBE: Why would you kill his fish?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. RACHEL: Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? ROSS: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Wait, he's not here yet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
РОСС: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Alright.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good.
НЕДРУГ: Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother. AMBER: Oh Drake.
НЕДРУГ: Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
НЕДРУГ: Some guys are just lucky I guess.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
НЕДРУГ: Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?DR. HORTON: No, no, they only said you.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, ok. Alright.
НЕДРУГ: I love you Drake.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, whatever. Oh no.

РОСС: No.
РОСС: C'mon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey.
РОСС: Open up. We want to talk to you.
ДЖОУИ: I don't feel like talkin.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're worried about you.
МОНИКА: And some of us really have to pee.
МОНИКА: Sorry Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We came over as soon as we saw.
РОСС: How could you not tell us?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
ДЖОУИ: Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me wa me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin. PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera. JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
ФИБИ: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say. MONICA: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice. CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?
ДЖОУИ: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna b as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credi card application, and I was pre approved. Huh? I've neve been pre-approved for anything in my life. CHANDLER: I'm sorry man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us. JOEY: No, that means nothin to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhhhaahh.
НЕДРУГ: Pecan sandy, just made em.
