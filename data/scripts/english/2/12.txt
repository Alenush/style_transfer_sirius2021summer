НЕДРУГ: Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth.
НЕДРУГ: With MonkeyShine Beer. MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.
РОСС: That commercial always makes me so sad.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
РОСС: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
ФИБИ: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
МОНИКА: And the fact that they're both monkeys.
РОСС: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
РОСС: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat, all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rhythm?
ДЖОУИ: No, my first fan mail.
НЕДРУГ: Alright!
МОНИКА: 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
МОНИКА: This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.
РОСС: Hey guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
РОСС: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L. A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
ФИБИ: Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
ФИБИ: I know, I know. Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
ФИБИ: Hi Rob Dohnen.
НЕДРУГ: I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
ФИБИ: Oh, wow.
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
ФИБИ: Oh, I would love to have kids, you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: It's Erica.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, the stalker.
НЕДРУГ: Never mind, it's open.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
ДЖОУИ: Let's get out of here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The one time they're not home.
ДЖОУИ: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
ДЖОУИ: She's comin'.
НЕДРУГ: It's me.
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait, wait, wait.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Erica.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
РОСС: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
РОСС: Oh my God, what happened?
НЕДРУГ: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
РОСС: I can't believe this.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
РОСС: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
РОСС: Zoo dollars?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
НЕДРУГ: Ooohhh.
ФИБИ: I know.
МОНИКА: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And she's not crazy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
НЕДРУГ: You OK?
ФИБИ: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
НЕДРУГ: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
ФИБИ: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
РОСС: I was thinkin' about it.
ФИБИ: OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Phoebe.
ФИБИ: OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah it is, what?
НЕДРУГ: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
НЕДРУГ: Who's they?
ДЖОУИ: No one.
НЕДРУГ: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them, but I won't.
ДЖОУИ: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off.
НЕДРУГ: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
ДЖОУИ: Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
НЕДРУГ: Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
НЕДРУГ: Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
РОСС: Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
НЕДРУГ: It's about your monkey. It's alive.
НЕДРУГ: I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
НЕДРУГ: No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?
ДЖОУИ: But that's what.
НЕДРУГ: I should just be happy to be near you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey I.
НЕДРУГ: Hey what?
ДЖОУИ: That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey.
ФИБИ: There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
МОНИКА: Excellent!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Very informative!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not at all inappropriate!
ФИБИ: Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
НЕДРУГ: That was great, the kids loved you.
ФИБИ: Yay, I rock.
НЕДРУГ: And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth. You were incredible.
ФИБИ: But.
НЕДРУГ: How did you know there was a but?
ФИБИ: I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
НЕДРУГ: The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
ФИБИ: I can do that.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
ФИБИ: Thinkin' about it.
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
РОСС: Buddy, my monkey?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.
РОСС: Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
НЕДРУГ: The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
РОСС: That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
НЕДРУГ: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
РОСС: That guy Lipson?
НЕДРУГ: Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
РОСС: No, I, I only know Lipson.
НЕДРУГ: Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with.
РОСС: Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
НЕДРУГ: Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.
РОСС: Of course.
НЕДРУГ: Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
РОСС: This is unbelievable.
НЕДРУГ: So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
РОСС: Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
НЕДРУГ: Maybe.
РОСС: But you already told me everything.
РОСС: Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, so what're you gonna do?
РОСС: Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
ФИБИ: OK, hi again.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!
НЕДРУГ: You're the only one who can save her Drake.
НЕДРУГ: Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
РОСС: Well, there goes my whole belief system.
НЕДРУГ: It's Erica.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
МОНИКА: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Erica, c'mon in.
НЕДРУГ: How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?
ДЖОУИ: Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
ДЖОУИ: Who?
НЕДРУГ: Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
ДЖОУИ: It's not what you think, that was.
НЕДРУГ: You told me I was the only one.
ДЖОУИ: Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
ДЖОУИ: Somebody wanna help me out here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know, I know.
НЕДРУГ: How, how can you be here and there.
ДЖОУИ: 'Cause it's a television show.
НЕДРУГ: Drake, what're you getting at?
ДЖОУИ: I'm not Drake.
РОСС: That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
НЕДРУГ: Is this true?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me.
МОНИКА: And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard.
НЕДРУГ: Is all this true?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
НЕДРУГ: Oh Hans.
РОСС: Hans. Hans. Yo evil twin.
ДЖОУИ: Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care.
НЕДРУГ: I'll never forget you Hans.
ДЖОУИ: OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
ФИБИ: Fired! Why?
НЕДРУГ: The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
ФИБИ: I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
НЕДРУГ: No.
ФИБИ: I see.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
ФИБИ: No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
НЕДРУГ: I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
ФИБИ: Who's Barney.
РОСС: Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're kidding.
ДЖОУИ: This is amazing.
РОСС: I know.
ДЖОУИ: I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
ФИБИ: OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
ФИБИ: Um, yeah I guess that's me.
НЕДРУГ: She's here.
ФИБИ: Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
РОСС: This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
НЕДРУГ: C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
РОСС: Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry guys, closed set.
РОСС: Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
МОНИКА: Ross, there he is.
РОСС: Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema-way, a-weema-way.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh.
ДЖОУИ: Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
РОСС: Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
ДЖОУИ: Woah, dude, burn.
РОСС: I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
НЕДРУГ: Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
НЕДРУГ: In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
НЕДРУГ: Woah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
НЕДРУГ: The one in the director's chair.
ДЖОУИ: Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
ФИБИ: OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
ДЖОУИ: Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
НЕДРУГ: We've got a problem.
НЕДРУГ: Tell me.
НЕДРУГ: I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
НЕДРУГ: Is it bad?
НЕДРУГ: It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, JeanClaude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
НЕДРУГ: I'll talk to her.
НЕДРУГ: I hate actors.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahhhh.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, is your name Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, yes, yes it is.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler Bing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
НЕДРУГ: I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look, great job growing up.
НЕДРУГ: It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
НЕДРУГ: Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What what what what?
МОНИКА: JeanClaude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ya think?
МОНИКА: The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, was he any good in it?
МОНИКА: Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
МОНИКА: Oh, yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
МОНИКА: He could hear me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
МОНИКА: Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me. Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
НЕДРУГ: You don't think I'm cute?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
НЕДРУГ: You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
НЕДРУГ: OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
НЕДРУГ: Oh that's me, I gotta go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh uh, o, OK.
НЕДРУГ: Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, uh, let's try one more, there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
НЕДРУГ: I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No one was around to hear that?
МОНИКА: So what'd he say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
МОНИКА: Well, thanks anyway.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
МОНИКА: Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: JeanClaude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And then JeanClaude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
ДЖОУИ: Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of, no guys around, huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Does anybody need anything?
МОНИКА: Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is so unfair.
ФИБИ: I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
РОСС: Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
ДЖОУИ: You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
РОСС: Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
ФИБИ: Stick a fork what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like, when you're cooking a steak.
ФИБИ: Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
ФИБИ: Well you know, you just, you eat them and you can tell.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
МОНИКА: What did you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
ФИБИ: Oh, you just know.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
НЕДРУГ: But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
НЕДРУГ: Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You want me to wear your panties?
НЕДРУГ: Could ya?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. You're swell.
РОСС: OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.

ДЖОУИ: Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
РОСС: Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.
ФИБИ: OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
ФИБИ: Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share.
МОНИКА: Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is the most ridiculous.
МОНИКА: You sold me out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did not sell you out.
МОНИКА: Yes you did. Absolutely.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would you let me talk.
МОНИКА: Did you just flick me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus Ow. That hurt.
МОНИКА: Quit flicking.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow, you stop flicking.
МОНИКА: You flicked me first.
ФИБИ: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
НЕДРУГ: Ow. Ow. Ow.
ФИБИ: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
МОНИКА: Uh-huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
МОНИКА: OK.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh that's what you want.
МОНИКА: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine.
МОНИКА: Fine,
ФИБИ: There we go. You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
РОСС: Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
ДЖОУИ: Forget about it.
НЕДРУГ: How you doin there squirmy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm hangin in, and a little out.
ДЖОУИ: So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.
НЕДРУГ: I have nothing to do with casting.
ДЖОУИ: So what're you guys gonna eat?
НЕДРУГ: How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
НЕДРУГ: I want you right here, right now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp.
НЕДРУГ: Meet me in the bathroom.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm going to the bathroom now.
НЕДРУГ: C'mon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe we're doing this.
НЕДРУГ: Alright mister, let's see those panties.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alrighty.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
