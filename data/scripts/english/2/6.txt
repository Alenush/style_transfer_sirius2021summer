РОСС: Come on, don't do this.
МОНИКА: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
ДЖОУИ: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
МОНИКА: That is so funny. Let me see that.
ДЖОУИ: Are you ok, Ross?
РОСС: I don't know. What's in this pie?
МОНИКА: Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi.
РОСС: Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
МОНИКА: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
РОСС: And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
МОНИКА: No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and-oh my god.
РОСС: Ugh.
МОНИКА: Oh my god.
РОСС: Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
МОНИКА: Is your tongue swelling up?

МОНИКА: All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
ДЖОУИ: Is he gonna be ok?
МОНИКА: Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
РОСС: You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
МОНИКА: Jacket now.
РОСС: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We'll watch him.
РОСС: I don't think tho.
ДЖОУИ: What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
РОСС: Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
ДЖОУИ: Hat, milk, got it.
РОСС:? Thro up a thro thro-a thro thro!
ДЖОУИ: Consider it done.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You understood that?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
ФИБИ: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
ФИБИ: I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.

НЕДРУГ: F. Y. I. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie, something. She's supposed to be very good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But what about Phoebe?
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
НЕДРУГ: Uh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
ФИБИ: Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
ДЖОУИ: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I got him.
ДЖОУИ: No, seriously.

ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
НЕДРУГ: I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
ДЖОУИ: What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
НЕДРУГ: I think it's great you guys are doing this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we are great guys.
НЕДРУГ: You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?
ФИБИ: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, I'm sorry.
ФИБИ: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying Terry's a jerk! That's where that came from.
ФИБИ: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
НЕДРУГ: I, I don't know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
НЕДРУГ: You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.

ФИБИ: Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
ФИБИ: Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, but Pheebs.
ФИБИ: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la.
РОСС: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
НЕДРУГ: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
МОНИКА: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
РОСС: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
МОНИКА: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
НЕДРУГ: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
РОСС: Tho?
РОСС: Ohhh.
МОНИКА: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
РОСС: Ok.
МОНИКА: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, look at that talent.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you. He's just adorable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
НЕДРУГ: So what are you guys out doing today?
ДЖОУИ: Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You done?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, there's our stop.
ДЖОУИ: Get outta here. This is our stop too.
НЕДРУГ: You guys live around here too?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know it?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?
НЕДРУГ: So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, sure, they love us over there.
НЕДРУГ: Where's your baby?
НЕДРУГ: Ben! Ben! Ben!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
НЕДРУГ: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
МОНИКА: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
НЕДРУГ: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.

ДЖОУИ: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.

НЕДРУГ: Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please tell me you know which one is our baby.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok.
ДЖОУИ: Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
ДЖОУИ: You got a better idea?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, call it in the air.
ДЖОУИ: Heads.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Heads it is.
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Whew!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have to assign heads to something.
ДЖОУИ: Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Oh, hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here. I thought you might be cold.
ФИБИ: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
ФИБИ: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you?
ФИБИ: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang SuSuSuicide, I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, Smelly Cat, I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
ФИБИ: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for Smelly Cat.
ФИБИ: Really? From who?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
НЕДРУГ: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Here you go.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!
РОСС: I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.
МОНИКА: That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
РОСС: Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
МОНИКА: Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
РОСС: Oh.
МОНИКА: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?
РОСС: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
МОНИКА: No. But I remember people telling me about it.
РОСС: I hope Ben has a little sister.
МОНИКА: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
РОСС: I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
МОНИКА: That was you?
РОСС: They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
МОНИКА: Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, he's not crying.
ДЖОУИ: Yes! There's still pie.

ФИБИ: Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: You wanna try it again?

ФИБИ: Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?
НЕДРУГ: Ok.
ФИБИ: Mmmm hmmm.
НЕДРУГ: Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault.
ФИБИ: That's too much. Sorry.
