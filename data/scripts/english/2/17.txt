ДЖОУИ: I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think. 
ФИБИ: Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back? 
ДЖОУИ: You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad. 
МОНИКА: I promise you, he would definitely want you back. 
РОСС: I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together. 
РОСС: Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.

ФИБИ: Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, so what's it about? 
ДЖОУИ: Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I like both eggs equally. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?

МОНИКА: Fun? Fun, you think this is fun? 
РОСС: Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids. 
МОНИКА: Ross, I hated you when we were kids. 
РОСС: You hated me when we were kids? 
МОНИКА: Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts. 
РОСС: Why did you hate me? 
МОНИКА: Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way. 
РОСС: And that wasn't fun for you? 
МОНИКА: Duh-huh!

ФИБИ: Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video. 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ФИБИ: Yes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, how did you find out? 
ФИБИ: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue. 
МОНИКА: So what're you gonna do? 
ФИБИ: Well, I can't work with people who would do this. 
МОНИКА: Sure. 
ФИБИ: I mean this poor woman. 
РОСС: What woman? 
ФИБИ: The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, Phoebs. But what about you? 
ФИБИ: Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't like that show? 
НЕДРУГ: Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running. 
НЕДРУГ: I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh o-, OK man. 
ФИБИ: Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody. 
НЕДРУГ: Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault. 
ФИБИ: Monica. 
МОНИКА: They won't take you to the vet. 
ФИБИ: Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're obviously not their favorite pet. 
МОНИКА: Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: It may not be a bed of roses. 
ФИБИ: Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you're no friend to those with noses. 
ФИБИ: Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.
