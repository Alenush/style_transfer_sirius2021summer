НЕДРУГ: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me! 
РОСС: Rache! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? 
РОСС: It was, it was great. Oh, what happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: You're bleeding. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything! 
РОСС: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. I'm from New York. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. 
МОНИКА: I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross. 
ФИБИ: Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? 
ДЖОУИ: Um, this? 
ФИБИ: Yes. 
МОНИКА: Guys, you got your hair cut. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay. 
ФИБИ: 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes! 
РОСС: That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. 
РОСС: And bus. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god. 
РОСС: You gotta hear this story. 
НЕДРУГ: We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old, and this guy- 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about. 
МОНИКА: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. 
РОСС: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? 
МОНИКА: It's just an expression. 
РОСС: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby. 
НЕДРУГ: And then we've gotta get some sleep. 
РОСС: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen, 'cause I like to be surprised. 
РОСС: Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Rache, can I get- 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you talk to him? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not yet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then, no. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. 
РОСС: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God? 
РОСС: It was you, pal. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe it was God, doing me. 
РОСС: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you owe me one, big guy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here's your lemonade. 
РОСС: I didn't order lemonade. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. 
РОСС: But- 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever. 
РОСС: How is that the silver lining? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have to really wanna see it. 
РОСС: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. 
МОНИКА: Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking? 
ФИБИ: Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? 
МОНИКА: No, although now that's what I'm thinking. 
ФИБИ: All right, so what were you thinking? 
МОНИКА: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? 
ФИБИ: Oh. No. 
МОНИКА: Why not? 
ФИБИ: Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak. 
МОНИКА: No you're not. 
ФИБИ: I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings. 
ДЖОУИ: Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie. 
РОСС: Hello? Hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi. Anybody know a good tailor? 
ДЖОУИ: Needs some clothes altered? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk. 
ДЖОУИ: Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance! 
РОСС: Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y- 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. 
РОСС: Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have. 
МОНИКА: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her. 
ДЖОУИ: You know, I think I was sixteen. 
МОНИКА: Please, just a little bit off the back. 
ФИБИ: I'm still on "no". 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec? 
ДЖОУИ: No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again. 
ФИБИ: What's goin' on? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What stupid thing did you do? 
НЕДРУГ: Bon giorno tutti! 
ФИБИ: Ewww! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. 
МОНИКА: Rachel, how did this happen? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night. 
ФИБИ: Where? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: At his apartment. Is this juice? 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser. 
МОНИКА: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: People do stupid things when they're upset. 
МОНИКА: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't-- but this is about your horrible mistake. 
РОСС: Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching. 
ФИБИ: Hey, hey Ross. 
РОСС: Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here? 
НЕДРУГ: I do Raquel. 
РОСС: So, uh, he's back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem? 
РОСС: No, not a problem. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm glad it's not a problem. 
ФИБИ: Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code? 
МОНИКА: You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. 
ФИБИ: All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it. 
МОНИКА: I promise. 
ФИБИ: All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing. 
ФИБИ: All right, that's it, I quit. 
МОНИКА: What? I didn't say anything. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person. 
МОНИКА: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. 
ФИБИ: Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it. 
МОНИКА: How who wears it? 
ФИБИ: Demi Moore. 
МОНИКА: Demi Moore is not a he. 
ФИБИ: Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten. 
МОНИКА: That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore. 
ФИБИ: Oh, oh, oh my god! 
МОНИКА: Oh my god! 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore? 
МОНИКА: She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost. 
ФИБИ: Oh, she's got gorgeous hair. 
МОНИКА: I KNOW! 
НЕДРУГ: How long do you want the cuffs? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: At least as long as I have the pants. 
НЕДРУГ: I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How is she? 
ФИБИ: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. 
РОСС: How's the hair? 
ФИБИ: I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. 
ДЖОУИ: Can we see her? 
ФИБИ: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in. 
ДЖОУИ: How're you doing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm ok. 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me. 
ДЖОУИ: You gotta tell Ross how you feel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie? 
ДЖОУИ: What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I don't know. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yo, paisan. Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man. 
ДЖОУИ: Frankie? What're you talking about? 
РОСС: Hey, what's goin' on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. 
РОСС: What? 
ДЖОУИ: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite- 
РОСС: what? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cupping. 
ДЖОУИ: That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? 
РОСС: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you? 
ДЖОУИ: What? That's not? Oh my god. 
МОНИКА: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better. 
РОСС: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. 
МОНИКА: Thank you. My hair is very amused. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. 
ФИБИ: Thank you. 
РОСС: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, are you leaving? 
РОСС: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!" 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's ok. 
РОСС: What's goin' on? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what? 
РОСС: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
РОСС: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I think that was the whole all. 
ДЖОУИ: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants. 
НЕДРУГ: I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andy McDowell's new haircut? 
ФИБИ: You wanna do it right now? 
НЕДРУГ: Great! 
ФИБИ: Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes. 
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're welcome.
