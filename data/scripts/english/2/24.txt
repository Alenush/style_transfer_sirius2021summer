РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, how'd the audition go? 
ДЖОУИ: Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. 
НЕДРУГ: Who? 
ДЖОУИ: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'Cause he was just so darn cute. 
ДЖОУИ: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. 
РОСС: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it. 
ДЖОУИ: I did do it, I'm a professional. 
МОНИКА: Then what's the problem? 
ДЖОУИ: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. 
ФИБИ: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, what did your agent say? 
ДЖОУИ: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me. 
МОНИКА: What, forget it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, right. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on, I need your help here. 
ФИБИ: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again. 
ДЖОУИ: You see this, this is a friend. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. 
ДЖОУИ: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem? 
МОНИКА: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that makes sense. 
РОСС: Over my dead body! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield. 
РОСС: Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, you look so good! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous. 
РОСС: So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because I promised Mindy I would. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself. 
ФИБИ: Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I may have. 
МОНИКА: Woo-hoo, stuud! 
РОСС: What's she look like? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet. 
МОНИКА: Woo-hoo, geeek! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy... 
РОСС: Get out! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo! 
МОНИКА: Please! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! What's that like? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's like this, me, no jokes. 
ФИБИ: All right, stop it, you're freaking me out. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye, Richard. 
МОНИКА: Bye sweetie, I love you. 
НЕДРУГ: I love you, too. 
ФИБИ: I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like. 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? What wedding? 
ФИБИ: Come on, like you never talk that. 
МОНИКА: Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Afraid to ask him? 
МОНИКА: Could not be more terrified. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum. 
МОНИКА: Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is. 
НЕДРУГ: Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out. 
МОНИКА: Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure I do. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, am I in it? 
НЕДРУГ: Honey, you are in it. 
МОНИКА: Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah! 
МОНИКА: Keep talkin'. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast. 
МОНИКА: Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner? 
НЕДРУГ: Like a hound? 
МОНИКА: Not a basset, a bassinet. 
НЕДРУГ: You really need the bassinet? 
МОНИКА: Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start. 
МОНИКА: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: Look I want you, now. 
МОНИКА: That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, no means no! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep. 
ДЖОУИ: Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon . 
РОСС: Get away from me I said no! 
МОНИКА: Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him 
НЕДРУГ: Bye. 
ФИБИ: Bye, good luck. 
ФИБИ: So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words. 
ФИБИ: What does she mean by HH? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It means we're holding hands. 
ФИБИ: Are you the cutest? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm afraid I might just be. 
ФИБИ: You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her. 
ФИБИ: It could be like a big giant guy. 
ДЖОУИ: Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on? 
ФИБИ: We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you not fall down more? 
ФИБИ: Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?' 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married! 
ФИБИ: Well at least we know she's a woman. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe she's married. 
ДЖОУИ: Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh . 
МОНИКА: So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun. 
МОНИКА: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about. 
НЕДРУГ: Neither am I. 
РОСС: Hey, there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
РОСС: Are you all right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time. 
РОСС: Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God I know, you're right. 
НЕДРУГ: All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I'll see you after the thing. 
РОСС: Okay, good luck 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you, Okay, Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why the hell didn't you tell me! 
РОСС: I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes. 
РОСС: Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg. 
НЕДРУГ: It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much. 
НЕДРУГ: You told me you didn't see anything. 
НЕДРУГ: I tell ya a lot things! 
НЕДРУГ: Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear. 
НЕДРУГ: Stay well. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today. 
НЕДРУГ: Rach! Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I'm married! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min. 
НЕДРУГ: Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about? 
НЕДРУГ: Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Insane! 
НЕДРУГ: ...from the syphilis. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on. 
ДЖОУИ: Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? 
ФИБИ: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong. 
ФИБИ: Oh, my. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: She wants to meet you in person. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband. 
ФИБИ: What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I'll do it! 
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. 
МОНИКА: Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry. 
МОНИКА: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do. 
НЕДРУГ: Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel... 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! 
РОСС: Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? 
РОСС: Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh dear God. 
РОСС: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See you in the parking lot. 
РОСС: No, Rach! 
НЕДРУГ: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... "Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..." 
РОСС: Marenge, 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: "...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.." 
РОСС: Everybody! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa.... 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'll do it. 
МОНИКА: You'll do what? 
НЕДРУГ: If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will. 
МОНИКА: You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.' 
НЕДРУГ: But you're not. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one. 
НЕДРУГ: God. I love you. 
МОНИКА: I know you do. Me too. So what now? 
НЕДРУГ: I guess we just keep dancing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, oh, oh, that's her. 
РОСС: Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind. 
ФИБИ: Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: OH.....MY.....GAWD!! 
НЕДРУГ: OH.....MY.....GOD!! 
РОСС: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes . 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
