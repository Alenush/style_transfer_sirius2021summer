РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, would you slow down, they're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.
ДЖОУИ: I'm excited, I've never gotten reviewed before.
МОНИКА: You were so amazing as the king, I was really impressed, I was.
ФИБИ: Although, you know what. You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your, royal subject.
ДЖОУИ: Here it is, here it is. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs read yours.
ФИБИ: OK. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
РОСС: I don't want to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
РОСС: Oh c'mon, maybe your just, uhh, your just paying your dues.
ДЖОУИ: NO, no, no, it, it's too hard. It's not worth it, I quit.
МОНИКА: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute, wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani was able to achieve brilliant new levels of, continued on page 153, sucking.
ДЖОУИ: When I was little I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.
РОСС: Hhiii.
ФИБИ: Are, are you OK?
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegasaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Woah, woah, I know this jacket, this is, th. Fun Bobby's jacket, where is he, what. He, he's here isn't he?
МОНИКА: Maybe.
РОСС: Don't toy with me.
НЕДРУГ: Geller!
РОСС: Hey, Fun Bobby!
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Woah, hey, you've been working out, huh?
РОСС: Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear your back with my sister.
МОНИКА: You and me both.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?
ФИБИ: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
ДЖОУИ: No, I'm all right man, really.
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm picking you up.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me. Alright, it still works.
НЕДРУГ: OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.
МОНИКА: OK, I'll see ya later babe.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, public display of affection coming up, you can avert your eyes.
НЕДРУГ: See ya.
НЕДРУГ: Bye. See ya. Later.
ФИБИ: Fun Bobby is so great.
МОНИКА: Oh, isn't he? Oh, ya know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at leas my cup is half full.
ФИБИ: Half full of luuuv.
МОНИКА: And for our two week anniversary he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
ФИБИ: Cabin of luuuv.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
МОНИКА: Really? I only had two glasses.
ДЖОУИ: I just had a glass.
ФИБИ: Two.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I had one glass.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I had about a mugfull in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, so that's, that's what, two bottles, and yet somehow we went through five?
РОСС: Oooh.
ДЖОУИ: Ohhh.
МОНИКА: So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
РОСС: Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a, a drink in his hand.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Ooh, OOOH, yeah, ya know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soo bombed,' or, umm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
ДЖОУИ: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
МОНИКА: Well, we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or, or to a club, or to the, zoo.
МОНИКА: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ehhumm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
МОНИКА: Mm, no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well too late, sorry, you already had some.
НЕДРУГ: Whad'ya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
ФИБИ: Um, cake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna get some cake.
МОНИКА: You know what, it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I would make them Belgian but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
МОНИКА: Bobby.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, OK.
МОНИКА: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know, but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
НЕДРУГ: OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this but, I don't know, I always made excuses about it like, uhh, 'I'm just a social drinker,' or 'C'mon, it's flag day.'
МОНИКА: So, what are you saying now?
НЕДРУГ: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me.
ФИБИ: Soo, what's goin on, huh?
НЕДРУГ: I am gonna try and quit drinking?
ФИБИ: Ohh, why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guess who's back in show business.
ФИБИ: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, Phoebs, you know why? Cause he's dead.
ФИБИ: Oh, no.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but Joey that's who.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, my agent just called me with and audition for Days of Our Lives.
ФИБИ: Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do like a soap opera theme.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, yeah, we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
ФИБИ: Hey, Rach, what time do you get off, we're all gonna do something tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhmm, well actually I'm already done, but I, I kinda got plans.
МОНИКА: You have other friends?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I uhh, I have a, I have a date.
МОНИКА: What?
ДЖОУИ: With a man?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what is so strange about me having a date?
ДЖОУИ: What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo, no, I'm not mad at him, I'm, I'm not really anything at him anymore.
МОНИКА: What are you talking about?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm, not.
ФИБИ: But you guys came so close.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.
НЕДРУГ: Hhiii.
НЕДРУГ: Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh honey give me a break will ya. Ooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.
НЕДРУГ: Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I think it went pretty well, I, I got a callback for Thursday.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, have you ever seen me estatic?
ДЖОУИ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Well, here it is.
ДЖОУИ: OK, uhh, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, yeah she's great but. I kinda got the feeling that she was, sort of, coming on to me. And I definately would get the part if I would of, you know, if I would have sent the Little General in.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terriffic? Uh-huuh Uh-huuuuh. OK doll, talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's the matter?
МОНИКА: It's Fun Bobby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, isn't he sober?
МОНИКА: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh, OK.
МОНИКА: Alright, here you go sweetie.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. You wanna here something funny?
МОНИКА: Oh God yes!
НЕДРУГ: There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
ФИБИ: That is funny.
НЕДРУГ: I needed to buy a hammer the other night and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
МОНИКА: Ahh, hey honey, don't you have to be at your interview now?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah. See ya guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ridiculously dull Bobby.
МОНИКА: Oh my God.
ФИБИ: It's not that bad.
МОНИКА: Not that bad! Did you hear the hammer story?
ФИБИ: Ok, ok, don't get all squinky.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
МОНИКА: But I'm gonna be there, for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him, I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
ФИБИ: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull, you just, you know, set it free.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Ross, bahhhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK.
НЕДРУГ: OK, I'll just sit here and, uh, chat with your, uh, friend type, people.
ФИБИ: Rachel, um, hi.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh, Bob Sagett?
ФИБИ: Oh yeah. No, no, no, no, oh, oh.
ФИБИ: Oh my oh!
РОСС: What, what's wrong?
ФИБИ: I, OK.
МОНИКА: She's just upset becuase she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
РОСС: Alright.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ, Russ, Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РОСС: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachels?
РОСС: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachels?
НЕДРУГ: Actually I'm a, kind of a, you know a, date type thing, of Rachels.
РОСС: A date.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm her date.
РОСС: Oh, oh you're uh, you're, oh you're the date.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, this is actually good because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you are the, uh, paleontologist.
РОСС: Yes, yes I am. And you are a.
НЕДРУГ: Periodontist.
МОНИКА: See, now they're as different as night and, later that night.
РОСС: Well, I am going to, uhh, get a beverage. It was nice, nice, uh, meeting you.
НЕДРУГ: Ditto.
РОСС: I uh, well, I, I met Russ.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we're not seeing each other, so.
РОСС: Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum who's curator of moths and other, uh, winged things, who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a, well you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay but, uh, if this is the deal.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yeah, this is the deal.
РОСС: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, Russ, you ready?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye.
МОНИКА: Bye.
ФИБИ: Bye.
РОСС: She's dating, she's dating.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
РОСС: Whad'ya mean?
МОНИКА: Do you not see it?
РОСС: See what? I don't know what she sees in innn that goober. And it takes him what like, like, I don't know, uhh-huhh, hello, a week to get out a sentence.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
РОСС: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Woah, woah, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part or, uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
ДЖОУИ: Well, the part's mine if I want it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my. God.
ДЖОУИ: Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives that's actually on television.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what're you gonna do?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I guess I could sleep with her, I mean. How can I do that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I, I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
ДЖОУИ: I've never slept with someone for a part.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well is she.
ДЖОУИ: Sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's alright. Is she good looking?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Ya know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Ya know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
ДЖОУИ: I just, I just don't think that I want it that way though, ya know. I mean, let's say I do make it, alright, I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent of because of, ya know, the Little General.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco I had to promote it.
НЕДРУГ: Can I get you something from the bar?
МОНИКА: Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.
НЕДРУГ: If, if you want to drink it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
МОНИКА: No, no really, I, I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.
НЕДРУГ: So the light went out in my refrigerator.
МОНИКА: I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, we're having some fun now, huh Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK, eleven letters, atomic element number 101, ends in ium.
НЕДРУГ: Disprosium.
РОСС: Disprosium. Try mendelevium.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine down, Knights in White Satin, was sung by the Doody Blues.
ФИБИ: You don't see it? You actually do'n't see it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: OK honey, you're dating Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, Phoebs, I'm dating Russ.
ФИБИ: Russ is Ross. Russ Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Steve sleeve.
ФИБИ: OK, no one is named Sleeve.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheobe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than there names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
РОСС: For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
НЕДРУГ: You could not be more wrong. You could try but you would not be successfull.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye poking begins.
НЕДРУГ: I know what your problem is.
РОСС: Oh you do, do ya?
НЕДРУГ: Um-hum, you're jealous.
РОСС: Of, of what?
НЕДРУГ: You're jealous becuase I'm a real doctor.
РОСС: Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss, day two, here's your diploma.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you listen.
РОСС: No, no, let me finish.
НЕДРУГ: No, let me finish.
РОСС: No, you let me fini.
РОСС: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did Joey say what he was gonna do when he left?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, who would I have to sleep with?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why would I have to sleep with you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's my game, you want the job or not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Morning.
РОСС: Where ya goin'.
МОНИКА: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
РОСС: Oohhh.
ФИБИ: What's with all the bottles of liquor?
РОСС: What's goin on, is, uh, Bobby drinking again?
МОНИКА: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, even his knock is boring.
МОНИКА: Hi, I'll be ready in just a second.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, can I talk to you a minute.
МОНИКА: Sure.
НЕДРУГ: This is really hard for me to say.
МОНИКА: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no no, it's about you.
МОНИКА: What about me?
НЕДРУГ: I think you may have a drinking problem.
МОНИКА: What these, oh, these are, um, for cuts and scrapes.
НЕДРУГ: Look, I am just not strong enoughto be in a co-dependant relationship right now, OK.
МОНИКА: Oh, shoot.
НЕДРУГ: Well anyway, I hope we can be friends.
МОНИКА: OK.
МОНИКА: Take care.
НЕДРУГ: You too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What happened?
МОНИКА: Well we, we kinda broke up.
НЕДРУГ: Oohhhhh.
МОНИКА: Does anybody want these?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: How'd the callback go?
ДЖОУИ: It was unbelievable, I walked in there and she was all over me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what'd you do?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
РОСС: Good for you.
ДЖОУИ: But wait, wait, wait. Then after I left her office she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
ФИБИ: So, and.
ДЖОУИ: Soo, you are now looking at Dr. Drake Remore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes.
НЕДРУГ: All right!
ДЖОУИ: All right, I've got to go shower.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hey.
ФИБИ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I'm sorry man.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?
ФИБИ: Oh I do, it's, it's Bob Sagett. She hates him.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Julie!
ФИБИ: Hey, how are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: Um, oh, I don't know, I mean, it's definitely wierd not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he um.
