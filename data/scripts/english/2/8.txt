НЕДРУГ: Ross kissed me.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was unbelievable!
МОНИКА: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
ФИБИ: Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it ended very well.
ФИБИ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
ФИБИ: Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a I gotta have you now kind of thing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.
ФИБИ: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhh.
РОСС: And, uh, and then I kissed her.
ДЖОУИ: Tongue?
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Cool.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
ФИБИ: Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Games and stuff.
МОНИКА: There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
ДЖОУИ: Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
МОНИКА: There's an ad for a naked chef?
ДЖОУИ: No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then.
РОСС: Hi.
ФИБИ: Hey, oh, so, um how'd you make out last night?
РОСС: That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
РОСС: Yeah, it was, but. I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
ДЖОУИ: You got all that from saline solution?
МОНИКА: We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
РОСС: Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, you.
РОСС: How are you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good. How are you?
РОСС: Good.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, honey.
РОСС: Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
НЕДРУГ: Good.
РОСС: Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Oh, well, actually.
РОСС: Play it.
ФИБИ: Ok, all right.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Ssshh.
ФИБИ: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, Two of Them Kissed Last Night. There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!
НЕДРУГ: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.
МОНИКА: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
НЕДРУГ: Mockolate.
МОНИКА: I'm sorry?
НЕДРУГ: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
МОНИКА: Ohh.
НЕДРУГ: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
МОНИКА: All right. Mmm-mmm.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
НЕДРУГ: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F. D. A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.
МОНИКА: Mmm-mmm.
НЕДРУГ: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the mockolate holiday.
МОНИКА: Wow.
НЕДРУГ: Aren't you going to swallow that?
МОНИКА: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, isn't that great?
МОНИКА: Mmm.
НЕДРУГ: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?
МОНИКА: Abso lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
МОНИКА: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
МОНИКА: How about mockolate mousse?
ФИБИ: It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
МОНИКА: Ok, how about pilgrim mockolate mousse?
ФИБИ: What makes it pilgrim?
МОНИКА: We'll put buckles on it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did uh, Ross call?
МОНИКА: No, I'm sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.
ФИБИ: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
РОСС: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, here's a thought, Ross.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.
РОСС: Can't we just use a pen?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, Amish boy.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
РОСС: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
ДЖОУИ: You could say that.
РОСС: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
РОСС: I don't know.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
РОСС: She's not Rachel.
МОНИКА: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god.
МОНИКА: Oh my god good?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
ФИБИ: Oh, oh sweet lord! This is what evil must taste like!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
РОСС: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, Spock actually hugs his father?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, do you guys have hi.
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where you goin'?
РОСС: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?
РОСС: Well, uh.
ДЖОУИ: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
РОСС: Really. It's always been you, Rache.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, god.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.
РОСС: I know, I know, it's, it's almost what do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let me get my coat.
РОСС: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Nothing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well what is it? Let me see.
РОСС: Hey, someone order a coat?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
РОСС: He won't, he won't. Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
НЕДРУГ: No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.
РОСС: That's it? That's all you wrote? You are the worst writer in the whole world.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
РОСС: No, you don't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. What is this? Ross, what is this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good luck.
РОСС: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
РОСС: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type little, the idiot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just a waitress?
РОСС: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rache?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
РОСС: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
РОСС: No, Rache, come on. Rache! Rache, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra-Rachel?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
МОНИКА: You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
ФИБИ: I, I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
МОНИКА: This was your idea?
ФИБИ: What were you thinking?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
МОНИКА: Yeah. You!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
ФИБИ: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
РОСС: Rache! Whoops! Rache, hey, open up, please!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
РОСС: I just wanna read something. It's your pro-list.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not interested.
РОСС: Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben. Number six: the way you smell.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
РОСС: Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, I do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing out there?
РОСС: I am, uh, I am.
МОНИКА: Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate?
РОСС: Rache, come on, open up. Rache, come on, come on, Rache. You got to give me another chance.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
РОСС: No?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's what I said.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, maybe we should go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.
РОСС: rache, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
РОСС: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!
РОСС: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.
ДЖОУИ: I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.
МОНИКА: Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.
НЕДРУГ: Doesn't matter.
МОНИКА: What?
НЕДРУГ: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
МОНИКА: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
МОНИКА: Well, uh, I ate some.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
МОНИКА: Hello?
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
МОНИКА: Listen, I, I don't think this is the best time.
РОСС: Look, can, can you do something for me?
МОНИКА: Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?
НЕДРУГ: The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, thanks for coming in again.
МОНИКА: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
НЕДРУГ: It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called fishtachios. They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?
МОНИКА: Cat hair.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sorry.
