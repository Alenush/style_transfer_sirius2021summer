РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
МОНИКА: Oh, I ordered mine first.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster.
МОНИКА: Give it to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
МОНИКА: Give it to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, you can have it.
МОНИКА: There you go, enjoy your coffee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was there when I got here.
ФИБИ: Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
МОНИКА: Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
ФИБИ: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You went out with a guy in the Navy?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
ФИБИ: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
МОНИКА: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
РОСС: Hiii.
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, what happened?
РОСС: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no.
РОСС: Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I've had it.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I've had it.
МОНИКА: Had it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Had it.
ФИБИ: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
МОНИКА: Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
НЕДРУГ: Monica. Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
МОНИКА: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
НЕДРУГ: What're you doing?
МОНИКА: Just waiting for you sweetie.
НЕДРУГ: Are you remaking the bed?
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
НЕДРУГ: Then, you're redoing it because.
МОНИКА: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
НЕДРУГ: You're pretty much running that risk either way.
МОНИКА: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well that's not so crazy.
МОНИКА: I'm just easing you in.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, alright.
МОНИКА: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
МОНИКА: Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
ДЖОУИ: But don't you need experience for a job like that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
НЕДРУГ: No kidding.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
НЕДРУГ: Where do you work?
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much, processing any more.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
НЕДРУГ: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha.
ДЖОУИ: Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
МОНИКА: You look fabulous honey, you really do.
ФИБИ: Yeah? Are you sure, really.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
ФИБИ: I, I, I'm hideous.
МОНИКА: It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
ФИБИ: Come in.
НЕДРУГ: Hey baby, I'm back.
ФИБИ: Hey Ryan, what's up?
НЕДРУГ: What's goin' on?
ФИБИ: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
НЕДРУГ: Chicken or small?
ФИБИ: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
НЕДРУГ: Why aren't you at home in bed?
ФИБИ: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
ФИБИ: Ohh, ohh.
НЕДРУГ: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
ФИБИ: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
НЕДРУГ: Can I please see your face?
ФИБИ: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
НЕДРУГ: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
ФИБИ: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me. Oh, I am scary.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
ФИБИ: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
ФИБИ: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, how's the first day goin'?
ДЖОУИ: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well there you go.
ДЖОУИ: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Weird world. Your kids?
ДЖОУИ: I figure my character has kids.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
ДЖОУИ: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid. Ya know what? Just did.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
НЕДРУГ: You know what makes the itching even worse?
ФИБИ: That you don't stop talking about it.
НЕДРУГ: Fine.
ФИБИ: Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go. Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice.
НЕДРУГ: What're you doing? Are you scratching?
ФИБИ: No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
НЕДРУГ: You're scratching. Give me the dice.
ФИБИ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Give me the dice.
ФИБИ: No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
НЕДРУГ: We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
ФИБИ: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
НЕДРУГ: No.
ФИБИ: Give it.
НЕДРУГ: No.
ФИБИ: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
НЕДРУГ: Oh God help me.
ФИБИ: Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
РОСС: You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
ДЖОУИ: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
НЕДРУГ: Bye bye Joey.
ДЖОУИ: What a phony.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
ДЖОУИ: Sir.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
НЕДРУГ: I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah Bing, what's that about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
НЕДРУГ: Rough numbers?
ДЖОУИ: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
НЕДРУГ: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, if you say so sir.
ДЖОУИ: Joseph's good, isn't he?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm going to kill you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
ДЖОУИ: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
МОНИКА: This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
НЕДРУГ: You're strict.
МОНИКА: It's for their own good.
НЕДРУГ: You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
МОНИКА: Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
НЕДРУГ: If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
МОНИКА: Very good.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
МОНИКА: You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
НЕДРУГ: You're gonna do what to my clocks.
МОНИКА: I'm gonna set them to my time.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
МОНИКА: No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
НЕДРУГ: Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
МОНИКА: No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
НЕДРУГ: No come on. Come on tell me.
МОНИКА: No. See you don't understand.
НЕДРУГ: Come on.
МОНИКА: No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
НЕДРУГ: No that's not true. That is not true.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Alright, well tell me one of yours.
НЕДРУГ: Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
МОНИКА: What if they get mixed up?
НЕДРУГ: Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
МОНИКА: You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
НЕДРУГ: See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? Wh wh why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
ДЖОУИ: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wha wh why, why, why does he suspect that?
ДЖОУИ: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
ДЖОУИ: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
ДЖОУИ: Karen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No freakshow, she's fictional.
ДЖОУИ: Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
ФИБИ: Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
НЕДРУГ: Well that wasn't easy.
РОСС: Ok, dinner's on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
РОСС: Alright you kids, bye now.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
ФИБИ: It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
НЕДРУГ: Wine?
ФИБИ: Please.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I spilled some.
ФИБИ: I got it.
НЕДРУГ: I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
ФИБИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. You look beautiful.
ФИБИ: Oh.
ФИБИ: You know what, that's it, that's it.
НЕДРУГ: Monica, wake up. Monica.
МОНИКА: What's up?
НЕДРУГ: I thought of a thing.
МОНИКА: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
МОНИКА: No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
НЕДРУГ: Or so I would have you believe.
МОНИКА: No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
НЕДРУГ: Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
МОНИКА: Alright, go on.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, you're a freak.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. How 'bout that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
НЕДРУГ: I really can't say.
РОСС: So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
НЕДРУГ: I can't say.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, but I can't say.
РОСС: Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
НЕДРУГ: I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
ФИБИ: Ok, I'll walk you out.
РОСС: Bye Ryan.
НЕДРУГ: Pleasure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was nice to meet you.
НЕДРУГ: Take care.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
РОСС: You like that do ya?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah.
РОСС: I'll make some calls.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
ФИБИ: I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
НЕДРУГ: Taxi.
ФИБИ: Bye you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-. Hey sailor.
РОСС: Is this what you had in mind?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'll say.
РОСС: I'm shipping out tomorrow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
РОСС: Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
