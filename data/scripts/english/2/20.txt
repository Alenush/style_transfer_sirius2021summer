ФИБИ: Hey. Watcha guys doin?
НЕДРУГ: Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
ФИБИ: Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: What're you talkin' about?
ФИБИ: C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
РОСС: Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
ФИБИ: What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's not the end.
ФИБИ: Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
МОНИКА: What about the part where he has rabies?
ФИБИ: He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
ФИБИ: What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
МОНИКА: Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers. Chicken and potatoes. What am I wearing?. Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
ДЖОУИ: Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
МОНИКА: Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
МОНИКА: Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
ДЖОУИ: No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
МОНИКА: Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
ДЖОУИ: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
НЕДРУГ: Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, that's Eric.
НЕДРУГ: Glad to be of help. Matches.
МОНИКА: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know.
МОНИКА: C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
МОНИКА: So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
ДЖОУИ: How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, this could be tough.
ДЖОУИ: Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, you almost had it.
РОСС: No no, you're fine, you're fine.
НЕДРУГ: Hello.
РОСС: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hi honey.
РОСС: Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
НЕДРУГ: You can watch our tape if you want.
РОСС: I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
НЕДРУГ: Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
РОСС: Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen, I mean, I feel like.
НЕДРУГ: Great. That would be fine.
РОСС: Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
НЕДРУГ: Oh shoot, that would have been fun.
РОСС: Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.
ФИБИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
ФИБИ: Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
МОНИКА: Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.
МОНИКА: So'd you guys have fun?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your boyfriend is so cool.
МОНИКА: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, he must like you the best.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car.
ДЖОУИ: No problem. Hey Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think they get it.
ДЖОУИ: Ok.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's the man.
ДЖОУИ: He-he-eyy.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
ДЖОУИ: Ok. He kept my dollar.
МОНИКА: So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
РОСС: Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
НЕДРУГ: Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
РОСС: Buy mommy.
НЕДРУГ: We love you. Bye.
РОСС: Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
МОНИКА: Ross.
РОСС: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
ДЖОУИ: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
РОСС: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
МОНИКА: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
ДЖОУИ: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
РОСС: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
МОНИКА: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
ДЖОУИ: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
РОСС: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
МОНИКА: You're meeting Richard?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
МОНИКА: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You hear that? We're the guys.
ДЖОУИ: We're the guys.
МОНИКА: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
РОСС: Thank you.
РОСС: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No luck huh?
РОСС: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but. Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
РОСС: What're you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I'm holding Ben.
РОСС: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
РОСС: Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is how I would hold a football.
РОСС: Ok, here, here. There we go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven t been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
РОСС: It's alright, it's no big deal.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You think about stuff like that?
РОСС: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Two, two babies?
РОСС: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then what's gonna happen?
РОСС: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
РОСС: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
РОСС: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
ФИБИ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
ФИБИ: Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
МОНИКА: So you watched the movies huh?
ФИБИ: Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
НЕДРУГ: Charlotte who?
ФИБИ: With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
МОНИКА: Alright, you wanna feel better?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Ok, here, watch this.
ФИБИ: It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
МОНИКА: So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
ФИБИ: Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
ФИБИ: Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, big guy, game time.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, be right there.
МОНИКА: There's a game?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
НЕДРУГ: It's the basketball playoffs.
МОНИКА: Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
МОНИКА: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, it's the college playoffs.
МОНИКА: Oh, then go Vassar.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, they're not in it.
МОНИКА: Ok, then just go.
НЕДРУГ: Ok.
МОНИКА: Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
ФИБИ: Sure.
МОНИКА: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
ФИБИ: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aghh.
ФИБИ: Me too.
МОНИКА: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
МОНИКА: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Christmas candles.
РОСС: Ok, what the hell happened back there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
РОСС: Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
РОСС: C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
РОСС: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What was the book?
РОСС: The big book of childrens' names.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
РОСС: Ok fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
РОСС: We're not done.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn't know that.
РОСС: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine, I will.
РОСС: Good, 'cause I love you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I love you too.
РОСС: Well that's the first time we've said that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes it is.
РОСС: Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well you better.
ФИБИ: Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
МОНИКА: Did you like it?
ФИБИ: Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
МОНИКА: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
ФИБИ: I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kick save and, denied.
НЕДРУГ: But, he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and. BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
ДЖОУИ: Man you are incredible.
НЕДРУГ: Well, we had a table in college.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
НЕДРУГ: Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
МОНИКА: Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, just one more point.
МОНИКА: Score! Now can we go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, that's why we don't let her play.
НЕДРУГ: Is everything all right?
МОНИКА: Um-hmm.
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
НЕДРУГ: Well.
ДЖОУИ: No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
ДЖОУИ: Nooooo.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh, yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
НЕДРУГ: That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
МОНИКА: Nighty-nite.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
ДЖОУИ: Not a dad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe you got us into trouble.
МОНИКА: So are you ok?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
МОНИКА: Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
НЕДРУГ: What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
МОНИКА: Yeah, well they suck too.
РОСС: Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
РОСС: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: It's us.
РОСС: Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.
РОСС: Wha, what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ben just said hi.
РОСС: What, the word hi?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
РОСС: Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
НЕДРУГ: Hello.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
НЕДРУГ: What did he say?
РОСС: Something about hi.
НЕДРУГ: That's so exciting.
НЕДРУГ: Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know, actually it's more like, hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, this could go on for a while.
НЕДРУГ: We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
РОСС: Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.
НЕДРУГ: Tuesday.
РОСС: Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Take care.
РОСС: Bye Ben.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.
НЕДРУГ: Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
НЕДРУГ: We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting.
РОСС: Alright, alright, ok. Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
ФИБИ: Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
НЕДРУГ: Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
