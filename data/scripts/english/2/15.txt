ФИБИ: I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well they were chair shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
РОСС: This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dike is practically life size.
НЕДРУГ: Woah!
МОНИКА: Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.
МОНИКА: Yes but my mom got me this job.
ФИБИ: OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
МОНИКА: Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
ФИБИ: I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.
ФИБИ: It's James Bond.
МОНИКА: Sorry we're late.

МОНИКА: Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
МОНИКА: I've been great, just great. How have you been?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
МОНИКА: The head tilt?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
МОНИКА: I'm sorry.
НЕДРУГ: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
МОНИКА: Oh, that's too bad.
НЕДРУГ: I'll survive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, GellerGreen, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
ДЖОУИ: What if we have to pee?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll cancel the sodas.
МОНИКА: You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
НЕДРУГ: But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
МОНИКА: You're an opthamologist.
НЕДРУГ: Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sheriff.
ФИБИ: That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
НЕДРУГ: See.
МОНИКА: Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
НЕДРУГ: OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
ФИБИ: You are so smitten.
МОНИКА: I am not.
ФИБИ: Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
МОНИКА: Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
ФИБИ: So. You two are totally into each other.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
ФИБИ: OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
МОНИКА: Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
ФИБИ: Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
МОНИКА: Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little, hard to follow.
РОСС: I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica.
РОСС: It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, I'm just checking.
РОСС: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica.
РОСС: Mon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica.

РОСС: And that's, that's funny why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
РОСС: I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK.
РОСС: OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
РОСС: No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just one cheek.
РОСС: Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
РОСС: That's romantic.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: C'mon touch it.

ДЖОУИ: She laughed at you?
РОСС: Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and, why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's the Miracle Wax.
ДЖОУИ: It certainly is a miracle.
