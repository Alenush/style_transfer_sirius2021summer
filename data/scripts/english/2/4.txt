РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, hi can I help you? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her. 
НЕДРУГ: Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, how, how did you do that? 
ДЖОУИ: This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married? 
ФИБИ: Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card. 
МОНИКА: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything. 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve. 
МОНИКА: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? 
РОСС: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental. 
ФИБИ: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend. 
МОНИКА: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. 
НЕДРУГ: Huuh. 
МОНИКА: Well, didn't you? 
ФИБИ: I might have. 
МОНИКА: I can't believe you didn't tell me. 
ФИБИ: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. 
МОНИКА: What have I not told you? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What! 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't know it was a big secret. 
МОНИКА: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple. 
ФИБИ: You have a third nipple? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You bitch. 
РОСС: Whip it out, whip it out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? 
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. 
РОСС: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey was in a porno movie. 
НЕДРУГ: Huuh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me. 
РОСС: You were in a porno? 
ДЖОУИ: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it. 
МОНИКА: That is wild. 
РОСС: So what's it shaped like? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, is there a hair on it? 
ДЖОУИ: What happens if you flick it? 
РОСС: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? 
РОСС: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special. 
МОНИКА: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it. 
НЕДРУГ: Woah. 
ДЖОУИ: Foxy lady. 
НЕДРУГ: Where you goin'? 
ФИБИ: Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades. 
ДЖОУИ: The Ice Capades? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny. 
МОНИКА: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again. 
ФИБИ: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. 
РОСС: Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . 
РОСС: OK sweetie, I'll see you later. 
НЕДРУГ: See you later Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye-bye Julie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, c'mon, cut it out. 
РОСС: Hey? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: Can I ask you somethin'? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure. 
РОСС: Naa. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? C'mon, talk to me. 
РОСС: OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? 
РОСС: Technically, huh, no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? 
РОСС: No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no no no, don't need to know the details. 
РОСС: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think it's sexy. 
РОСС: Sexy? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. 
РОСС: No kidding? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'd wait. 
РОСС: You'd wait? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more. 
РОСС: Really? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. 
РОСС: Women really want this? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: More than jewelry. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Ta-da. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, look at you, you look great. 
ФИБИ: Do I? Thank you, so do you. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. 
ФИБИ: Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice. 
НЕДРУГ: You always said I'd make it. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo. 
НЕДРУГ: I missed you. I'm gonna get changed. 
ФИБИ: OK. 
НЕДРУГ: Um, now. Phoebs. 
ФИБИ: Oh, right, OK. Ole. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ФИБИ: Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha. 
РОСС: Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Julie. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. 
РОСС: Hi everyone. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
РОСС: I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing? 
РОСС: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What did, what did he say? 
РОСС: Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. 
РОСС: Pop it in. 
ДЖОУИ: I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. 
РОСС: What's wrong with people having sex? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here. 
МОНИКА: Hell, I wanna see Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: So is there like a story or do they just start doing it right. . . oh, never mind. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen. 
МОНИКА: All I say is, she better get the job. 
РОСС: Looks to me like he's the one getting the job. 
ДЖОУИ: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice work my friend. 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . . 
ФИБИ: So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce. 
ФИБИ: Ohh. . .K. How come? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, actually, I'm getting married again. 
ФИБИ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight. 
ФИБИ: Huuh. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know, I. 
ФИБИ: I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties. 
НЕДРУГ: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore. 
ФИБИ: So how long have you known? 
НЕДРУГ: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in. 
ФИБИ: And um, and there's actually a, a woman? 
НЕДРУГ: Her name's Debra. 
ФИБИ: Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. 
ФИБИ: Sure. 
НЕДРУГ: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way. 
ФИБИ: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.' 
НЕДРУГ: I'm, I'm still me. 
ФИБИ: Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago? 
МОНИКА: You know, it still smells like monkey in there. 
НЕДРУГ: That saves us a conversation. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too, we should get goin'. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. 
МОНИКА: Rachel, that's all we do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie? 
НЕДРУГ: What about Julie? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, that could take a while. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got the time to get to know Julie. 
ДЖОУИ: I got time. 
МОНИКА: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, in a nutshell. . . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
ФИБИ: So, um, have you told your parents? 
НЕДРУГ: No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . . 
ФИБИ: Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better. 
НЕДРУГ: I love you Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: So your brother's straight huh? Seriously. 
НЕДРУГ: And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb. 
НЕДРУГ: Mrs., Mrs. Gobb? 
НЕДРУГ: No Cobb, as in cobb salad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm goin' home. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? 
РОСС: Goodnight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . . 
РОСС: Oh, no no, I am. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous? 
РОСС: Um, no, I uh, I have done it before. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce? 
РОСС: I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, gook luck. 
РОСС: Wha, uhh, what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. 
РОСС: OK, now I'm nervous. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe you should put it off. 
РОСС: No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, yeah, sorry. 
РОСС: What, it's not your fault. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that. 
РОСС: Really? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. 
РОСС: Uh-huh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. 
РОСС: Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, God. 
РОСС: Good morning. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, somebody got some last night. 
РОСС: Twice.
