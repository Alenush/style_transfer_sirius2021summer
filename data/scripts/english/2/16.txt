ДЖОУИ: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Waaa-aaah.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
ДЖОУИ: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
ДЖОУИ: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
ФИБИ: Ahh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, ready when you are.
ФИБИ: Okey-doke.
МОНИКА: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
ФИБИ: Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
ДЖОУИ: So where you gettin' it?
ФИБИ: I think on my shoulder.
РОСС: What? What's on your shoulder?
ФИБИ: Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
РОСС: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
РОСС: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
МОНИКА: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
МОНИКА: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
МОНИКА: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
ФИБИ: No, I think you should tell them.
МОНИКА: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
РОСС: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
РОСС: Alright, shall we?
МОНИКА: OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
РОСС: Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
МОНИКА: Happy birthday dad.
НЕДРУГ: Oh thank you.
РОСС: Hi ma.
НЕДРУГ: Happy birthday.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
РОСС: Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you kids take the train in?
НЕДРУГ: No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
МОНИКА: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
НЕДРУГ: Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
МОНИКА: Are we still on that?
НЕДРУГ: We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
НЕДРУГ: She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
ДЖОУИ: Can you believe this place?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, this is a great apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. You want it?
ДЖОУИ: Huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
НЕДРУГ: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
НЕДРУГ: C'mon, tell us.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, is she really 20.
НЕДРУГ: I am not telling you guys anything.
НЕДРУГ: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
РОСС: Dad, you really don't want to do that.
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
НЕДРУГ: Jack, would you let it go?
НЕДРУГ: Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You, you got your own little speedster.
НЕДРУГ: Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
НЕДРУГ: Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou.
РОСС: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
НЕДРУГ: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
ФИБИ: OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I.
ФИБИ: I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
ФИБИ: Here we go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: You're not going?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Well, yeah, maybe.
ФИБИ: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's 1922?
ФИБИ: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is.
ФИБИ: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
ФИБИ: OK, who is the boss of you?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You?
ФИБИ: No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!
НЕДРУГ: How ya doin'?
МОНИКА: I'm a twinkie.
НЕДРУГ: Really? I'm a hero.
МОНИКА: Oh, this is so hard.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
МОНИКА: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
НЕДРУГ: My parents are dead.
МОНИКА: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean, you know what I mean.
НЕДРУГ: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
МОНИКА: Alright.
НЕДРУГ: Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
НЕДРУГ: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
НЕДРУГ: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
НЕДРУГ: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
НЕДРУГ: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
НЕДРУГ: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
НЕДРУГ: Really.
НЕДРУГ: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
НЕДРУГ: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
НЕДРУГ: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
НЕДРУГ: Oh Jack stop.
НЕДРУГ: C'mon, it's my birthday.
ДЖОУИ: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
ДЖОУИ: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
ДЖОУИ: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
ДЖОУИ: Well that's how I feel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well then maybe you should take it.
ДЖОУИ: Well then maybe I will.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine with me.
ДЖОУИ: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
НЕДРУГ: Who's drink can I freshen?
НЕДРУГ: Almost time for cake.
РОСС: Mon, Mon, are you OK?
МОНИКА: You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
РОСС: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Well, I just caught the live show.
РОСС: Eww.
МОНИКА: Hey there.
НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
НЕДРУГ: Humm, really?
НЕДРУГ: Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, not that I know of.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
НЕДРУГ: That - that's an idea.
МОНИКА: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
НЕДРУГ: Oh?
НЕДРУГ: Oh?
РОСС: Ohh.
НЕДРУГ: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
РОСС: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
НЕДРУГ: So, who's the mystery man?
МОНИКА: Well, uh, he's a doctor.
НЕДРУГ: A real doctor?
МОНИКА: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
НЕДРУГ: Well that's wonderful. I.
МОНИКА: Mom, it's OK.
НЕДРУГ: It is Judy.
НЕДРУГ: Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
НЕДРУГ: Found it.
РОСС: I'll take that dad.
НЕДРУГ: It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
НЕДРУГ: That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
МОНИКА: Dad, I'm the twinkie.
НЕДРУГ: You're the twinkie?
НЕДРУГ: She's not a twinkie.
МОНИКА: Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in.
НЕДРУГ: Oh please, a relationship.
МОНИКА: Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
МОНИКА: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
МОНИКА: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
НЕДРУГ: When did I say that?
МОНИКА: Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
ФИБИ: Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
ФИБИ: Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
ФИБИ: Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You didn't get it?
ФИБИ: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why didn't you get it?
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
ФИБИ: I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah me too.
ДЖОУИ: I know. Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. So do we need to hug here or.
ДЖОУИ: No, we're alright.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I got ya something.
ДЖОУИ: Plastic spoons. Great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lick away my man.
ДЖОУИ: These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
ДЖОУИ: I'm movin' out like we talked about.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
ДЖОУИ: Well, it was a fight, based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or, whatever.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, there you go.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
ДЖОУИ: Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did pay for half of it.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
ДЖОУИ: Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
МОНИКА: So, are you sorry that I told them?
НЕДРУГ: No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is Ross here?
МОНИКА: No he went out to get pizza.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh really, OK.
МОНИКА: That's great.
НЕДРУГ: Very tasteful.
ФИБИ: Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
МОНИКА: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You didn't get one.
ФИБИ: OK, well then what is this?
НЕДРУГ: What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
ФИБИ: OK, that's my tattoo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
ФИБИ: OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
РОСС: You got a tattoo?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
РОСС: Lemme see.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well?
РОСС: Well it's really, sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but, wow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I guess.
РОСС: Hey, save us some pizza.
ДЖОУИ: Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop talkin' to your men.
ДЖОУИ: Yes! And the table is mine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Congratulations.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time, except when we are here.
ФИБИ: I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
МОНИКА: I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I remember.
РОСС: Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
ДЖОУИ: Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks.
ДЖОУИ: So, I guess this is it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
ДЖОУИ: Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
ДЖОУИ: Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
