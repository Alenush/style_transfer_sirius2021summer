ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
МОНИКА: So how was Joan?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I broke up with her.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhhh!
РОСС: Oh why?. don t tell me, because of the huge nostril thing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, they were not that huge.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
МОНИКА: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
ДЖОУИ: Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You or me?
РОСС: I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
ДЖОУИ: You guys are messin' with me, right?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa.
ФИБИ: You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maureen Rosilla.
РОСС: Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
МОНИКА: Hello, Mr. Heckles.
НЕДРУГ: You're doing it again.
МОНИКА: We're not doing anything.
НЕДРУГ: You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don't have birds.
НЕДРУГ: I could have birds.
МОНИКА: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, bye-bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
РОСС: We'll give you Janice.
ФИБИ: I miss Janice though. Hello, Chandler Bing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, my, god.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!
МОНИКА: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We won. We won!
МОНИКА: Mr. Heckles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How did this happen?
НЕДРУГ: He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
МОНИКА: That's terrible.
НЕДРУГ: I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
РОСС: Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
НЕДРУГ: You never know.
ФИБИ: Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, Phoebe.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
ДЖОУИ: Such as?
ФИБИ: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
РОСС: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
ФИБИ: Nah. Not really.
РОСС: You don't believe in evolution?
ФИБИ: I don't know, it's just, you know monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
РОСС: Too easy? Too. The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I just don't buy it.
РОСС: Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
ФИБИ: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
РОСС: You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
ФИБИ: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just. I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: UhOh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
НЕДРУГ: There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
МОНИКА: What can we do for you?
НЕДРУГ: All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to the noisy girls in the apartment above mine.
МОНИКА: Well, what about his family?
НЕДРУГ: He didn't have any.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, so let's talk money.
НЕДРУГ: All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
МОНИКА: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?. Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Have you ever seen so much crap?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.
ДЖОУИ: Check this out. Can I have this?
РОСС: How can you not believe in evolution?
ФИБИ: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
РОСС: Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
ФИБИ: Really? You can actually see it?
РОСС: You bet. In the U. S, China, Africa, all over.
ФИБИ: See, I didn't know that.
РОСС: Well, there you go.
ФИБИ: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look at this. My Big Book of Grievances.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate brings home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
МОНИКА: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is really cool.
МОНИКА: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what about my stuff?
МОНИКА: You don't have any stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
МОНИКА: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
МОНИКА: Mmmmm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, while you mmm on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
РОСС: Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
ФИБИ: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
РОСС: Please tell me you're joking.
ФИБИ: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
РОСС: No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because.
ФИБИ: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
РОСС: Is there blood coming out of my ears?
ДЖОУИ: Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, he looks so normal.
ФИБИ: He's even kind of cute.
ДЖОУИ: Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Funniest? Heckles?
ДЖОУИ: That's what it says.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
ФИБИ: I'd call that excessive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa!
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
ДЖОУИ: So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles. Would you knock it off?. Baaah!
ДЖОУИ: Have you been here all night?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
ДЖОУИ: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it supposably?
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you know that? How?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I understand.
ДЖОУИ: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
ДЖОУИ: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, it's me.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my, god.
ФИБИ: Janice? You called Janice?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
РОСС: You remember Janice, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
НЕДРУГ: Helloo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, my, god!
ДЖОУИ: Geez, look how fat she got.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, it's everybody.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice, you're.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, I am.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it-?
НЕДРУГ: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Congratulations.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
НЕДРУГ: And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
МОНИКА: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: Hide the Lamp.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, let it go.
МОНИКА: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
ФИБИ: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
РОСС: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
ФИБИ: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
РОСС: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
РОСС: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
ФИБИ: I can't believe you caved.
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am. Let me just get my coat.
МОНИКА: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
МОНИКА: Phoebe, tell her!
ФИБИ: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, you win.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
ФИБИ: Uh huh. Why is that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. Run away from Crazy Snake Man, they'll shout!
МОНИКА: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
МОНИКА: You are not a freak. You're a guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In a bad way?
МОНИКА: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
ФИБИ: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
МОНИКА: You made it!
ФИБИ: You're there!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are ready to make a commitment!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa! Don't know about that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
МОНИКА: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
МОНИКА: That's fine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll take that.
ДЖОУИ: You want his yearbook?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
МОНИКА: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's really not that big!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Takin' that with you, huh?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah.
РОСС: You comin'?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see Philosopher wanted?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure.
