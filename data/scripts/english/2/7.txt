ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something, repellant, about me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, how was the party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it couldn't have been worse, a woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive.
ФИБИ: No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Woah, woah, I've put on a little wieght?
ФИБИ: No, not wieght, ya know, more like insulation.
МОНИКА: Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you know, I would but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
МОНИКА: Please.
НЕДРУГ: C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin, home.
ФИБИ: Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make hands meet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, let's do it. What?
МОНИКА: Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And we're changing.
МОНИКА: C'mon give me five more. Five more.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
МОНИКА: Five more and I'll flash you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: One. Two. Two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?
ФИБИ: Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champange, nice.
ДЖОУИ: The guy still won't put out, huh?
ФИБИ: Nope, zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry Phoebs.
ФИБИ: Look, I, ya know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, ya know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe he, uhh, drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
ФИБИ: No, whad'ya mean. He's not British.j.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe he's, gay.
ФИБИ: Oohh, um, no I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like, definitely felt something.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
ФИБИ: No, I felt it on my hip, you could tell.
МОНИКА: Yo Bing. Raquetball in 15 minutes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, be a pal, lift up my hand and smack her with it.
ФИБИ: Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.
ДЖОУИ: Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.
ДЖОУИ: But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, ya know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you really OK about all this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on, he can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
РОСС: Hi guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РОСС: Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
МОНИКА: Only if you say his full name.
РОСС: Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
МОНИКА: Alright.
ДЖОУИ: You're getting a cat?
РОСС: Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Together?
РОСС: Uh huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Both of you?
РОСС: Yep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Together.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah we figure it'll live with Ross half the time and with me half the time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
РОСС: Hopefully.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date, with a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really uh, have a really good night and you two have a uh, have a uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
НЕДРУГ: I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I ve gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How long do cats live?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't, you know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
НЕДРУГ: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's just great.
НЕДРУГ: Um, cheers.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, right, clink.
НЕДРУГ: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that does sound. Ahh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean he just started going out with her.
НЕДРУГ: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
НЕДРУГ: Alright.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
ФИБИ: So, I figured it out.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ФИБИ: Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, Excellent butt, great rack.
ФИБИ: Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
ДЖОУИ: Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
ФИБИ: You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, it's a cat, ya know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, ya know, one of those fruitflys, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?
НЕДРУГ: Fruitflys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: So would you like any dessert?
НЕДРУГ: No! No dessert, just a check, please.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
НЕДРУГ: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie. I just want to get over him gosh, why can't I do that?
НЕДРУГ: Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, I'm over you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel, woo.
НЕДРУГ: Hang on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello, excuse me.
НЕДРУГ: What.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
НЕДРУГ: I'm talkin'!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can see that. I, just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, fine. I'll call you back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. OK Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
НЕДРУГ: Good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that uhm, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
МОНИКА: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it's Sunday, it's God's day.
МОНИКА: OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, stop.
МОНИКА: No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo.
РОСС: Hey Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahhhh.
РОСС: Oh. And how was the date?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhmm, I think there was a restraunt, I know there was wine.
РОСС: Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
РОСС: OK. Oh, oh, oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
РОСС: No, I stayed at Julie's last night.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, what, so, you had feelings for me first.
РОСС: Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had, you know?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler told me.
РОСС: Chandler. When did he, when did he, when did he.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When you were in China.
РОСС: China.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Meeting Julie.
РОСС: Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha, and now, now, now you're over me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you over me?
РОСС: That's, that's Julie. Ju, Julie, Julie. Hi Julie.
НЕДРУГ: Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
РОСС: I'll be right down.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, so, you're going?
РОСС: Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, ya know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm, I'm gonna go get a cat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, OK.
РОСС: Cat.
ФИБИ: Hey Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Phoebs.
ФИБИ: How come your watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
ДЖОУИ: I can't find the remote. Thank you.
ФИБИ: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
ДЖОУИ: And?
ФИБИ: And we did.
ДЖОУИ: All right Phoebs, way to go.
ФИБИ: Yay me.
ДЖОУИ: So, so how did it happen?
ФИБИ: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
ДЖОУИ: And what did he say?
ФИБИ: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I would gonna get all, ya know, like, ohh, is he gonna call me the next day and, ya know, where is this going and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
ДЖОУИ: Wow.
ФИБИ: Yeah, so I said, OK, relax please, ya know, I mean sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, ya know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. I convinced him.
ДЖОУИ: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
ФИБИ: Um-hum.
ДЖОУИ: This man is my God.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
РОСС: I didn't get a cat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's um, interesting.
РОСС: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, I got it Ross.
РОСС: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
РОСС: Then you should have said something before I met her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
РОСС: There was never a good time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.
РОСС: Not, not, not every night. You know, and, and it's not like I didn't try Rachel but things got in the way, ya know, like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?
РОСС: The point is I, I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?
РОСС: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
РОСС: Fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
РОСС: Good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good. And ya know what, now I've got closure.
РОСС: Try the bottom one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
МОНИКА: No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
МОНИКА: Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
МОНИКА: Well, thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
МОНИКА: Well, you know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
МОНИКА: Uh-huh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
МОНИКА: Well no, but um.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
МОНИКА: Ya know, I try to stay positive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you feel like goin' for a run?
МОНИКА: Alright.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
МОНИКА: OK. Just for a little while.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK.
