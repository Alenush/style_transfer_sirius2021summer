РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will have one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
РОСС: Neither will I.
ФИБИ: No, no, it's just my tooth.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right I'll have one.
РОСС: So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
ФИБИ: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
РОСС: Why? Why can't you go to him?
ФИБИ: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, what? Umm what?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And all these people actually died?
ФИБИ: Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
РОСС: Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
ФИБИ: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
РОСС: Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, like you don't already have everything.
ФИБИ: Ow! Ow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
ФИБИ: All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I promise.
ФИБИ: Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
РОСС: No, no he's not.
МОНИКА: You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
РОСС: What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
ДЖОУИ: It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
ФИБИ: Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
ДЖОУИ: Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a PlayDoo Fat Factory.
ФИБИ: Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or. All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um.
РОСС: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
ДЖОУИ: What did they do?
РОСС: Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
МОНИКА: So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
РОСС: Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
РОСС: You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, Ross?
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: I've got a science question.
РОСС: Hmm?
ДЖОУИ: If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
РОСС: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
МОНИКА: He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We're not?!
МОНИКА: No we're not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I like that.
МОНИКА: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot push it in!
МОНИКА: Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, okay, okay.
МОНИКА: I got it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Or. We could put a hat on his head.
МОНИКА: A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We need a hat.
МОНИКА: Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!
МОНИКА: Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
МОНИКА: Give it. Give it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
ДЖОУИ: I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a HubbaBubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
ДЖОУИ: I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
МОНИКА: It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right.
МОНИКА: Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
ФИБИ: No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.

НЕДРУГ: How's my Bing-a-ling?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
НЕДРУГ: Why are your eyes so white?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right!

ФИБИ: Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
МОНИКА: Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I. What?!
ДЖОУИ: You said number two.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I also said number one.
ДЖОУИ: I know.
РОСС: Hey! Everyone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: How's my little boy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's perfect, he's never been better.
РОСС: What'd you do, take him whaling?
НЕДРУГ: Monica.
РОСС: Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
НЕДРУГ: Monica bang!
МОНИКА: Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
ФИБИ: WooHoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
ДЖОУИ: Uh.
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
ДЖОУИ: I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
МОНИКА: All right, we should call somebody.
РОСС: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
МОНИКА: How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
ДЖОУИ: Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Well, now we got a reason.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right.
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh, what's a matter?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I talked to Janice.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, is she going back to him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
ДЖОУИ: What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
ДЖОУИ: Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, tell me.
ДЖОУИ: All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? What are you, what are you talking about?
ДЖОУИ: They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
РОСС: Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
РОСС: It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did!
РОСС: I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
РОСС: Monica did it?
РОСС: Monica?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РОСС: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
МОНИКА: No. Why?
РОСС: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
МОНИКА: Really?!
РОСС: Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
МОНИКА: You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
РОСС: Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'll get the hat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
НЕДРУГ: Wow!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then don't leave me!
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
НЕДРУГ: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, III've got to give my marriage another chance.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhh. Don't go.
НЕДРУГ: No, III gotta go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No! No! No!
НЕДРУГ: Honey, honey, people are looking.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't care! I don't care!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can't leave! I have your shoe!
НЕДРУГ: Good-bye Chandler Bing.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel has those in burgendy.
ДЖОУИ: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
РОСС: Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
ФИБИ: I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
ДЖОУИ: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
ФИБИ: He's alive! He's a-live!
МОНИКА: And yet, we're still poking him.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
РОСС: He does not look happy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love.'
ФИБИ: 'Love.'
НЕДРУГ: 'I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'No you know I don't mind.'
НЕДРУГ: 'Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'I know.'
ФИБИ: 'I know.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'I've found.'
ФИБИ: 'I've found.'
НЕДРУГ: ' in you, my endless love.' 'My endless love.'
