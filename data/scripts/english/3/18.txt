МОНИКА: What’s so funny?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.
МОНИКА: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: What-what’s so funny?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.
РОСС: Pffhah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s your problem?
РОСС: Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
РОСС: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
ФИБИ: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or what my Father called Thursday night.
РОСС: Here you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.
РОСС: Sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Frank! Hi!
НЕДРУГ: How are you?
ФИБИ: What are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well y'know, I would’ve called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn’t find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So.
ФИБИ: What happened?
НЕДРУГ: Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
ФИБИ: But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
НЕДРУГ: Well, we got into a fight ‘cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
ФИБИ: Your getting married?!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Wow!
ФИБИ: My little brother’s getting married!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I knew you’d be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
ФИБИ: Do I?
НЕДРУГ: Do you?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I do, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I’m gonna, I’m gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.
ФИБИ: Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?
МОНИКА: Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?
ФИБИ: What, he’s 18.
РОСС: Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Always illegal Joe.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know it-it’s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I’m a big surprise.
МОНИКА: So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
НЕДРУГ: Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
НЕДРУГ: And he was my best student.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, she was my best teacher.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?
РОСС: And so now you guys are gonna be married?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Great!
ФИБИ: Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?
НЕДРУГ: I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right?
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us.
ФИБИ: Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
НЕДРУГ: You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
МОНИКА: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
МОНИКА: Pete, can I get you something else?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.
МОНИКА: Haven’t you and I covered that topic?
НЕДРУГ: Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
МОНИКА: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
МОНИКА: I mean really, think about it.
НЕДРУГ: Ho-ho, I will.
ФИБИ: No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!
РОСС: Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
ФИБИ: No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
ФИБИ: But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.
ДЖОУИ: Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
ФИБИ: Yes. Not out loud.
РОСС: Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no-no-no.
ФИБИ: Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
НЕДРУГ: No.
ФИБИ: Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank.
ДЖОУИ: So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, let’s just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
МОНИКА: Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?
МОНИКА: Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids. All right, I get your point.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
МОНИКА: Uh, yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, pretty good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
МОНИКА: Here you go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What check thing?
МОНИКА: As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a 20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pete Becker. Pete Is this him?
МОНИКА: That’s Bill Clinton.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who’s he huggin’?
МОНИКА: Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We use it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There you go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.
МОНИКА: I’m not gonna go out with him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real 20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
МОНИКА: Or incredibly offensive.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, sure, that too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РОСС: All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.
НЕДРУГ: What, you don’t think I know that?
ДЖОУИ: Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet!
РОСС: Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, in a poem maybe.
РОСС: No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: You don’t have it anymore?
РОСС: No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
РОСС: It didn’t.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice.
ДЖОУИ: Now, wh-what, what is that like?
НЕДРУГ: It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
РОСС: Yeah, yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Why can’t I find that?
РОСС: Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!
ДЖОУИ: Well, I want it!
НЕДРУГ: You can have it!
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.
РОСС: Oh, no! No!
НЕДРУГ: It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it!
ДЖОУИ: Then you hold on to it!
НЕДРУГ: All right, man!
ДЖОУИ: All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
ФИБИ: You’re Frank’s best man?!
ДЖОУИ: I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.
ФИБИ: Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
РОСС: I’m the ring bearer.
ФИБИ: Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, who died on this?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to.
ФИБИ: Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
ФИБИ: Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
НЕДРУГ: Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
НЕДРУГ: You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, absolutely, yeah, send her in. Hi.
МОНИКА: What the hell is this?
НЕДРУГ: Hang on a second. I’llI’ll talk to you in the morning. I’m sorry what?
МОНИКА: Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
НЕДРУГ: Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.
МОНИКА: You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
НЕДРУГ: Umm, I’m still here.
НЕДРУГ: You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.
МОНИКА: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.
МОНИКА: Okay, umm, you’re a loon.
НЕДРУГ: Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say?
МОНИКА: I don’t know.
НЕДРУГ: Why not?
МОНИКА: ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
НЕДРУГ: One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
НЕДРУГ: Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!
ФИБИ: Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
НЕДРУГ: Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.
ФИБИ: What umm, what happened?
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
ФИБИ: Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
ФИБИ: Oh, sweetie, oh.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!
ФИБИ: Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
ФИБИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
ФИБИ: Okay, but.
НЕДРУГ: Wait, y'know what, II came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
МОНИКА: I know!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, then get the lobster!
МОНИКА: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
МОНИКА: And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Oh-no-no-no-no….
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just one drink?!
МОНИКА: So, where do you want to go?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you like pizza?
МОНИКА: Oh, that’s sounds great.
НЕДРУГ: I know a great little place.
НЕДРУГ: You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!
МОНИКА: Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that.
МОНИКА: Why, how much is that?
НЕДРУГ: That’s about 60 cents.
ДЖОУИ: Every night!
НЕДРУГ: You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
ФИБИ: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Frank.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Mrs. Knight.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. III was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
ФИБИ: Yeah, but not just that.
НЕДРУГ: Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less.
ФИБИ: None the less.
НЕДРУГ: None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want.
ФИБИ: That’s right, exactly. All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good.
НЕДРУГ: Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
ДЖОУИ: Joey’s your best friend. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
