ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it’s like to be you? 
МОНИКА: Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart! 
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this! 
РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РОСС: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away. 
МОНИКА: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
РОСС: We were all pretty shaken up about it. 
ФИБИ: Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way. 
РОСС: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person. 
МОНИКА: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? 
РОСС: You get the dollhouse. 
МОНИКА: I get the dollhouse! 
ФИБИ: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse? 
ФИБИ: No, just a barrel. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse. 
ФИБИ: Really?! Really?! 
МОНИКА: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Sophie! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Rach! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I realise that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Summer catalogue! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s the stuff! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don’t work for me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna. 
НЕДРУГ: Bing! That’s a great name. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you. 
НЕДРУГ: Me too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye, Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: So ah, what’s wrong with him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too? 
НЕДРУГ: Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, uh, uh, I am here. 
НЕДРУГ: I know that. 
МОНИКА: Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello. 
ФИБИ: Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful. 
МОНИКА: I know!!! 
ФИБИ: So, I’m here, ready to play. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ФИБИ: I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. 
МОНИКА: What’s this? 
ФИБИ: That’s a dog, every house should have a dog. 
МОНИКА: Not one that can pee on the roof. 
ФИБИ: Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And is this in case the house sneezes? 
ФИБИ: No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic. 
МОНИКА: I don’t want a ghost. 
ФИБИ: Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. 
РОСС: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen. 
ФИБИ: Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I need to talk to you! 
РОСС: Sure, what’s up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler. 
РОСС: I-I know. Well if something comes up... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me. 
ФИБИ: Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof! 
МОНИКА: Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go. 
ФИБИ: Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination. 
РОСС: Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof! 
ФИБИ: The little ones do. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Kate! 
НЕДРУГ: Morning. 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week... 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! 
ДЖОУИ: And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah... 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani. 
НЕДРУГ: I know! I-I’m a big fan of yours. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. 
ДЖОУИ: Get out of here, really?! 
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft. 
ДЖОУИ: They gave me the shaft all right. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something? 
ДЖОУИ: Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great. 
НЕДРУГ: Cool! I-I’ll see you then. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: All right, it’s time to act, my talking props. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow!! 
ФИБИ: Look, look! 
РОСС: Hey, what’s this?! 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. 
МОНИКА: It’s very interesting, Phoebe. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s this? 
ФИБИ: The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed. 
РОСС: This is the coolest house ever!! 
ФИБИ: Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! 
РОСС: I would! 
МОНИКА: Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. 
ФИБИ: Watch, watch. 
НЕДРУГ: Ooohhhh!! 
ФИБИ: And, and! 
НЕДРУГ: Ahhhh!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, my Father’s house does that! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud! 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler is fantastic!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I.... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a good heart? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. 
НЕДРУГ: Isn’t this great?! 
НЕДРУГ: Don’t spoil it. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say? 
НЕДРУГ: Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! 
ДЖОУИ: That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway? 
НЕДРУГ: He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care? 
ДЖОУИ: Do you want me to want you to care? 
НЕДРУГ: Do you? 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say? 
НЕДРУГ: I’ve got no reason to stay. 
НЕДРУГ: Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I’ll see you in the morning. 
НЕДРУГ: I can’t believe we go on in, in a week. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it’s gonna be all right. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs? 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: You know! At the place I told you about last night? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll see you tomorrow. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: G’night. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah, are you okay? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know. 
НЕДРУГ: Well umm, maybe if it had more heat. 
ДЖОУИ: How do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know? 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe he could slip her the tongue. 
НЕДРУГ: Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist. 
НЕДРУГ: And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach! 
ДЖОУИ: And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her! 
НЕДРУГ: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal.... 
ДЖОУИ: Something like that? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hi. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hi. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: It’s a little early to be drinkin’. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate. 
РОСС: Ohhhhh! 
МОНИКА: You’re kidding?! That’s great! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making... 
МОНИКА: Oh my. 
ДЖОУИ: Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s what you say at the end of a date. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’ 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion. 
МОНИКА: Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, they always called. 
МОНИКА: Hmm, bite me. 
НЕДРУГ: Did he call? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called? 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women. 
НЕДРУГ: Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. 
НЕДРУГ: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well... 
НЕДРУГ: The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. I... 
НЕДРУГ: Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Call her! Call her now! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Multiple, so many paper cuts. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well give me the phone then. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then you’re going to have to take her out again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s fine! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. 
РОСС: Mon? 
МОНИКА: I’m in the shower! 
РОСС: Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
ДЖОУИ: So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall? 
НЕДРУГ: About what? 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know, about what happened with us. 
НЕДРУГ: Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay? 
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress. 
НЕДРУГ: Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you? 
ДЖОУИ: Nooo. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Kate! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Lauren. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi, Lauren. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, pig! 
РОСС: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there. 
МОНИКА: Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire. 
ФИБИ: What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?! 
РОСС: Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room. 
ФИБИ: All right. Did everyone get out okay? 
МОНИКА: Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate. 
ФИБИ: Ohh. What is this? 
РОСС: No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!! 
ФИБИ: Ohh, the-the Foster puppets! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, and it’s all the time. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, thanks again for lunch. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, this, this was pleasant. 
НЕДРУГ: It was, wasn’t it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The food there was, was great. 
НЕДРУГ: Wasn’t it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So take care. 
НЕДРУГ: You too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. 
НЕДРУГ: Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sophie’s desk. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler!! Are you gonna call her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Noo! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahhhh--I’m not going to call you. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, o-okay. 
НЕДРУГ: So... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she’s not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
