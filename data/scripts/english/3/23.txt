ДЖОУИ: Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or... Dick. 
РОСС: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РОСС: Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Was it like a sneeze only better? 
РОСС: No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body. 
ДЖОУИ: What was it? 
РОСС: Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!! 
РОСС: Come on you guys, it's no big deal! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh. 
РОСС: Well what is it? Is it a mole? 
ДЖОУИ: No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole. 
РОСС: Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey guys! What's... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter. 
РОСС: Ahhh. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, right. 
ФИБИ: Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. 
НЕДРУГ: Good deal. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Vince is a fireman. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before? 
НЕДРУГ: 98 hot saves, highest in the force. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred. 
НЕДРУГ: Fire safety is not a joke, son. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're right, I know. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher. 
ФИБИ: Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you. 
ФИБИ: I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler. 
ДЖОУИ: So Pheebs, do they know about each other? 
ФИБИ: Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't. 
РОСС: Hey guys! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Well?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's? 
РОСС: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign. 
ДЖОУИ: Well what is it?! 
РОСС: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. 
РОСС: At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross." 
РОСС: Yeah, that'd be cool! 
МОНИКА: Pete's breaking up with me. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
МОНИКА: I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And? 
МОНИКА: Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you. 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you. 
НЕДРУГ: ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life. 
ФИБИ: That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God!!! 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department! 
ФИБИ: No! No! 
НЕДРУГ: No, no? 
ФИБИ: Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here! 
НЕДРУГ: W-w-w-wait! Why?! 
ФИБИ: Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? 
РОСС: Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off! 
НЕДРУГ: Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing? 
РОСС: Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple. 
НЕДРУГ: Well that's not a third nipple. 
РОСС: No? 
НЕДРУГ: First of all, it's on your ass. 
РОСС: Well then, what is it?! 
НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm with Hamilton! 
НЕДРУГ: He's good with rear things, bring him in too. 
МОНИКА: I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean. 
ДЖОУИ: Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them. 
ФИБИ: and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them? 
ФИБИ: Uh. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field? 
ФИБИ: Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Pheebs, pick one of them. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. Which one do you like more? 
ФИБИ: Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well sensitive is important, pick him. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh sure, go with the sissy. 
ФИБИ: Jason is not a sissy! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler. 
РОСС: Y'know I have dinner plans!! 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped. 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa. 
МОНИКА: Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command. 
РОСС: Yes, and the dimmer switch. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV. 
МОНИКА: No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I-kea! This is comfortable. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This place is amazing. 
ФИБИ: God, that is the nicest kitchen. 
МОНИКА: I know. 
ФИБИ: No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day. 
ДЖОУИ: Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook. 
МОНИКА: Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!

НЕДРУГ: Hey Monica, how's it going. 
МОНИКА: Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants. 
НЕДРУГ: Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!

НЕДРУГ: Hey Pete. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi, how ya doing? 
МОНИКА: Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going? 
МОНИКА: Oh no-no-no, it's still me. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back. 
МОНИКА: Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I love you. 
МОНИКА: I love you. 
НЕДРУГ: I love you, love you. 
МОНИКА: Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you thing the good news is? 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is? 
МОНИКА: Oh my. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!! 
РОСС: Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello. 
МОНИКА: And that's Pete's Mom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we’ve got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it. 
МОНИКА: Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing. 
МОНИКА: Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy. 
РОСС: Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian! 
ФИБИ: All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck! 
НЕДРУГ: Good luck! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet. 
ФИБИ: Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh sure. Vince?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yo!! 
ФИБИ: Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those. 
НЕДРУГ: So, what’s up? 
ФИБИ: Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. G-good deal. 
ФИБИ: I’m sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: No-no it’s okay. It’s just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and… That there’s so much in me I have to share with you yet. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, I didn’t. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, I can’t talk. I’m gonna go write in my journal. 
ФИБИ: Wait-wait-wait! Wait!! 
ФИБИ: I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. 
РОСС: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory. 
МОНИКА: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. 
РОСС: Gimme this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist. 
МОНИКА: Brides magazines? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. 
ФИБИ: Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing. 
МОНИКА: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
МОНИКА: I know. I need more pie. 
ФИБИ: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You didn’t break up with that fireman? 
ФИБИ: No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal. 
МОНИКА: So then, are you going to dump Jason? 
ФИБИ: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and, Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so’s Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So, It’s really just about the math. 
ФИБИ: Jason? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, come on in. 
НЕДРУГ: So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong? 
ФИБИ: Nah-ha! 
НЕДРУГ: You must be Ross. 
РОСС: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: I am Guru Saj. 
РОСС: Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so... 
НЕДРУГ: Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I’ve attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let’s take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it’s a koondis! 
РОСС: What’s a koondis? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know, what’s a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I’ve got a save that oughta shrink that right up. 
РОСС: I guess it’s worth a try. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh sure, we should see results.Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! 
РОСС: What?! What?! 
НЕДРУГ: We appear to have angered it. 
РОСС: We?! We angered it?! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love. 
РОСС: Oh God! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to.... 
РОСС: Ow!! 
НЕДРУГ: Oops. 
РОСС: What was, what was that? 
НЕДРУГ: Well it’s gone. 
РОСС: What?! How’s that? 
НЕДРУГ: It got caught on my watch. 
РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Lights. Uh, romantic lights. 
МОНИКА: Ooh, nice. 
НЕДРУГ: So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about. 
МОНИКА: Oh, right! I completely forgot about that. 
НЕДРУГ: Well ah, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life. 
МОНИКА: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world. 
МОНИКА: Wow. 
НЕДРУГ: There’s one thing missing. 
МОНИКА: What’s that? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s time for me to conquer the physical world. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion. 
МОНИКА: You wanna what?! 
НЕДРУГ: I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states! 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed. 
МОНИКА: And I suppose you used a ring designer for that. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think? 
МОНИКА: My parents will be so happy. 
ФИБИ: Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-- wear Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. I was. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: I was passin’ by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it’s kinda cool seeing you up there. 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa! Hey-hey! What’s going on here? Who is this guy? 
ФИБИ: I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince! 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it’s okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break. 
ФИБИ: Really?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven’t been going out that long. Come on, we haven’t even slept together yet. Huh. 
НЕДРУГ: You haven’t? 
НЕДРУГ: You have? 
ФИБИ: Well, this is none of my business. 
НЕДРУГ: I-I can’t believe this! You-you’ve slept with him?! 
ФИБИ: Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know Phoebe, I’m gonna make this real easy for you. 
ФИБИ: Well, that could’ve been really awkward. 
НЕДРУГ: You made him a candle light dinner in the park? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh yeah, I can’t believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick? 
НЕДРУГ: Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That’s supposed to be a duck right? ‘Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do? 
НЕДРУГ: Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
