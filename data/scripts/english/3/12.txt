РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tell him.
РОСС: It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
РОСС: Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
РОСС: Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
РОСС: Hmm? Oh, yeah.
ФИБИ: Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It must take you forever to find your keys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
ФИБИ: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
РОСС: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm, why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
РОСС: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
ФИБИ: Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
РОСС: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
ФИБИ: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich'. Why don't you get a magician?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right.
РОСС: She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
ДЖОУИ: It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
РОСС: Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
ДЖОУИ: Who?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
ДЖОУИ: The what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The abridgment.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, okay. The what?
НЕДРУГ: and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
НЕДРУГ: Twenty percent.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
НЕДРУГ: Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
РОСС: Hi, is Rachel there?
НЕДРУГ: And who may I say is calling?
РОСС: This is Ross?
НЕДРУГ: Ross of.
РОСС: Of Ross and Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
РОСС: Oh hey, hey Mark.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hold on a second.
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi honey!
РОСС: Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, he's just goofing around.
РОСС: Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
РОСС: Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!
РОСС: Okay, bye-bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow! Ross!
РОСС: Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number.
НЕДРУГ: All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
МОНИКА: Please, I'm not going for anything.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you don't, I will.
МОНИКА: Would you please go?
НЕДРУГ: Night Mon. Night Julio.
НЕДРУГ: Adios.
МОНИКА: Look Julio, someone left their book here.
НЕДРУГ: Ah actually, that is mine.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, what are you reading?
НЕДРУГ: Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
МОНИКА: Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?
НЕДРУГ: I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
МОНИКА: Your a poet and don't know it.
НЕДРУГ: Actually I ah, I am a poet.
МОНИКА: Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
НЕДРУГ: Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
МОНИКА: Mine? Right here?
НЕДРУГ: I can write an epic poem about this lip.
МОНИКА: How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
ДЖОУИ: You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two.
НЕДРУГ: Lovely, just lovely.
ДЖОУИ: Really? Thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
ДЖОУИ: Excellent, I'll be there.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
ДЖОУИ: Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
ФИБИ: Well, can you dance at all?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, no, no, no.
ФИБИ: What, what is that?
ДЖОУИ: Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
МОНИКА: Hi!
ФИБИ: Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
МОНИКА: It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
ДЖОУИ: Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
ДЖОУИ: Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
МОНИКА: Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
ДЖОУИ: The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
МОНИКА: Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Oh yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, I'm not done.
МОНИКА: All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye-bye.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, what, what?!
ФИБИ: What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You really think that is what he meant?
МОНИКА: Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
ДЖОУИ: Done.
НЕДРУГ: Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm.
НЕДРУГ: Wh-what's that?
РОСС: It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: One, two, three.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
НЕДРУГ: Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
НЕДРУГ: And you know who will be there to support, you?! Your one and only boyfriend.
НЕДРУГ: It's nice to have a boyfriend.
НЕДРУГ: Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross. Ross!
РОСС: I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right Ross! I get it!
РОСС: I mean my God.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're hurt!
РОСС: can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
РОСС: I would never do that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
РОСС: Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
ДЖОУИ: Mark's a genius!
РОСС: Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
РОСС: What am I going to do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
РОСС: I don't know you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
ДЖОУИ: And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Harddd,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
НЕДРУГ: Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
НЕДРУГ: And wait, I've got something for you.
НЕДРУГ: Mark!
НЕДРУГ: It's okay, Rachel knows.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but even soo.
НЕДРУГ: I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
РОСС: All right that's, that's it! Get off her!
НЕДРУГ: What is going on?
РОСС: What's going on?! That's what's going on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross!
РОСС: I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
НЕДРУГ: Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
ДЖОУИ: So, does that mean the audition is off?
НЕДРУГ: Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
ДЖОУИ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, out a beret, out a beret, big turn here, grand dechant, desont, desont, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
ДЖОУИ: It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
НЕДРУГ: Have fun.
ДЖОУИ: Bye.
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey.
ФИБИ: What are you wrapping?
МОНИКА: Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
ФИБИ: Yeah, it's a vase.
МОНИКА: Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
ФИБИ: Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
МОНИКА: What do you mean?
ФИБИ: Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
МОНИКА: So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
МОНИКА: You don't even know me.
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
МОНИКА: What?
НЕДРУГ: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
МОНИКА: Oh yeah.
НЕДРУГ: All right, let's do it!
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no. What was that?
ДЖОУИ: I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
НЕДРУГ: Well, people!
ДЖОУИ: People, people, people.
НЕДРУГ: Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
РОСС: I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A big idiot.
РОСС: A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
РОСС: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
НЕДРУГ: Let it be me! Let it be me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
РОСС: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where ya going?
РОСС: Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, with who?
РОСС: Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There was a woman at the. The stripper?!
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You have a play date with a stripper?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, I gotta get a kid.
РОСС: Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure, is she married?
РОСС: Ahh, no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Are you jealous?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
РОСС: You are totally jealous.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I.
РОСС: Honey, I love you too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
РОСС: What?
РОСС: Huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
НЕДРУГ: Is there a Julio here?
НЕДРУГ: I am Julio.
НЕДРУГ: Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
НЕДРУГ: Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
НЕДРУГ: No one likes a buttmunch.
НЕДРУГ: And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!
