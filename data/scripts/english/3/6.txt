НЕДРУГ: Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
ФИБИ: Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.
РОСС: I’m sorry the answer there would be none of us.
НЕДРУГ: Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
ДЖОУИ: Well, that’s really a different question.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
ДЖОУИ: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me, there was no time!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever, almost?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Does anybody need more coffee?
РОСС: Yeah, I’ll take some.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, there’s a dog out there!
ФИБИ: Oh, that is so unfortunate.
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
МОНИКА: Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
ФИБИ: You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
МОНИКА: Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye.
ФИБИ: Bye-bye! That’s why I moved out.
РОСС: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
ФИБИ: I think on some levels she already knows.
РОСС: Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
ФИБИ: Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РОСС: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.
ФИБИ: Why, nobody good?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
РОСС: So how many more do you have tomorrow?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’
МОНИКА: Ross, foot on the floor or come over no more!
РОСС: Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
МОНИКА: What?
РОСС: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm, how’s it going with you guys?
РОСС: Oh, better, actually. Y'know III think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
ФИБИ: Oh, really?
РОСС: Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and III think it’s gonna make a difference.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know, never.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.
ДЖОУИ: Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure. Ummm. What’s up?
ДЖОУИ: Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What gay thing?
ДЖОУИ: Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do I ever.
МОНИКА: Chris says they’re closing down the bar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No way!
МОНИКА: Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
МОНИКА: Got me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I get a beer.
МОНИКА: Hey, did you pick a roommate?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You betcha!
МОНИКА: Is it the Italian guy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Um-mm, yeah right!
МОНИКА: He’s so cute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
МОНИКА: Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.
НЕДРУГ: I am so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, isn’t it exciting, I mean it’s like having a boyfriend for life.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I know.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel stop!
НЕДРУГ: You’re so bad!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some, meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, so?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And now I’ve picked it up again.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
МОНИКА: Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.
МОНИКА: Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
МОНИКА: Aww, not right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, but that’s okay.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city?
МОНИКА: Oh, that’d be great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay!
МОНИКА: Thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye!
МОНИКА: Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
РОСС: No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye.
ФИБИ: So what are they doing?
РОСС: I don’t know, something girlie.
ФИБИ: Hey, you’re early.
МОНИКА: What are you doing with the lamp?
ФИБИ: I’m just taking it to be re-wired.
МОНИКА: Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.
ФИБИ: No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
НЕДРУГ: You’re disturbing my oboe practice.
ФИБИ: You don’t play the oboe!
НЕДРУГ: I could play the oboe!
ФИБИ: Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
НЕДРУГ: Who are you?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate.
НЕДРУГ: I’m Chandler’s new roommate.
НЕДРУГ: III don’t think so.
НЕДРУГ: I could be Chandler’s new roommate.
НЕДРУГ: But, he told me over the phone.
НЕДРУГ: He told me in person.
НЕДРУГ: That’s weird.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!
МОНИКА: Hi, again.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
МОНИКА: Thank you soo, much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
МОНИКА: You want some help with that?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don’t!
МОНИКА: Whoa! Are you okay?
ДЖОУИ: Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
МОНИКА: It’s the heat. And-and the humidity.
ДЖОУИ: That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.
МОНИКА: Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
ДЖОУИ: Like you wouldn’t believe. Wow! This is a great place.
МОНИКА: Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
ДЖОУИ: Gotcha.
МОНИКА: This place is really my Grandmother’s. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you bet I am!
МОНИКА: Okay, here’s your penis!
МОНИКА: Oh my God! What are you doing?!
ДЖОУИ: You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
МОНИКА: So?!
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, ah! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
МОНИКА: Yeah huh! Cover yourself up!
ДЖОУИ: Oh right, right.
МОНИКА: I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
ДЖОУИ: Well usually yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.
МОНИКА: It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but. By the way I can still see it.
МОНИКА: Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Huh?
МОНИКА: Where’s your bed?
ФИБИ: It’s not in the apartment? Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Okay, enough with the third degree! II’ve, I don’t live here anymore.
МОНИКА: What are you talking about?
ФИБИ: I’m sorry, IIII don’t live here anymore. II didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
МОНИКА: Everybody knows!
ФИБИ: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
МОНИКА: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
МОНИКА: What?!?!
ФИБИ: Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. II need to live in a land where people can spill.
МОНИКА: You can spill. In the sink.
ФИБИ: Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.
МОНИКА: I love you, too.
ФИБИ: Aww, good. What?
МОНИКА: What? I’m just said.
ФИБИ: No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So ah, whatcha watching?
ДЖОУИ: Baywatch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s it about?
ДЖОУИ: Lifeguards.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it sounds kinda stupid. Who’s she?
ДЖОУИ: Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Look at them run.
ДЖОУИ: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ll go get one.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, hello!
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
МОНИКА: Help yourself.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You okay?
МОНИКА: Phoebe moved out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right.
МОНИКА: I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Noo! You don’t have a boyfriend because. I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
МОНИКА: Well, I think so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.
РОСС: Hi. Where is everybody?
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
РОСС: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
ФИБИ: Oh no! Why?
РОСС: ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
РОСС: I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!
ФИБИ: Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
РОСС: Well, now I do!
ФИБИ: I’m sorry.
РОСС: Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’veI’ve ever.
ФИБИ: Aw, God Ross. Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm, this is nice.
МОНИКА: I know, it is isn’t it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
МОНИКА: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
МОНИКА: Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be.
МОНИКА: I know. Thanks.
РОСС: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I, had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
ФИБИ: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.
РОСС: Thanks.
ФИБИ: And you’re so sweet. And you’re kind.
РОСС: Thanks.
РОСС: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
ФИБИ: Huh?
ФИБИ: Okay, it’s okay.
ФИБИ: Oh.
РОСС: Wait, wait, wait.
ФИБИ: What?
РОСС: My foot is stuck in the pocket.
ФИБИ: What?
РОСС: No, I can’t get it out.
ФИБИ: Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.
РОСС: No, come on don’t start. Ouch!
ФИБИ: What?
РОСС: Stupid balls are in the way.
РОСС: Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
ФИБИ: You have chalk on your face.
РОСС: Huh?
ФИБИ: Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.
МОНИКА: Hey, are you okay?
РОСС: My wife’s a lesbian.
ДЖОУИ: Cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: RossJoey, JoeyRoss.
РОСС: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t believe you came back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel! Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, sorry.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, Barry.
