НЕДРУГ: Here you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you’d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!
НЕДРУГ: Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay.
НЕДРУГ: I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, II didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Umm.
НЕДРУГ: I dropped a cup.
НЕДРУГ: so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.
МОНИКА: Oh, this is so great.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it was.
МОНИКА: All right then. Bye.
МОНИКА: Hello, people who do not live here.
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Hello!
МОНИКА: I gave you a key for emergencies!
ФИБИ: We were out of Doritos.
РОСС: Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
МОНИКА: He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!
РОСС: Still?!
МОНИКА: Noo! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
МОНИКА: Two.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
ДЖОУИ: Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!
РОСС: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
НЕДРУГ: Joe. How’s it going?
ДЖОУИ: Good. Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
ДЖОУИ: So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
НЕДРУГ: Where do I know you from?
ДЖОУИ: Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
НЕДРУГ: No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.
НЕДРУГ: That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!
ДЖОУИ: See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.
НЕДРУГ: Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that was real.
ФИБИ: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
ФИБИ: What, so what are you gonna tell him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.
ФИБИ: Huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
ФИБИ: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t have any issues with my Father.
ФИБИ: Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.
ДЖОУИ: I hate this woman! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.
РОСС: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
РОСС: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me, a-sucks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive.
РОСС: Then be supportive like a guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: You ah, wanted to see me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff.
РОСС: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.
РОСС: What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?
РОСС: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
РОСС: Yes, I do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good.
РОСС: Yeah, II really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
РОСС: It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.
РОСС: No! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
РОСС: I’m just trying to help you, move on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty.
РОСС: Petty.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Petty.
РОСС: Petty.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Petty.
РОСС: Petty.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Small.
РОСС: Small.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are so just doing this out of spite.
РОСС: Awwwahuh, no, no, no!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh?
РОСС: I’mI’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!
РОСС: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: yeah-yeah-yeah!
РОСС: Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening.
ФИБИ: So, you’re like a zillionaire?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you’re our age. You’re our age.
ФИБИ: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
НЕДРУГ: What like Pete Dakota?
ФИБИ: Yeah, or, or, or, MississPete.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh, I got it! PeteChicago.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s not a state Joe.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, and MississPete is?
НЕДРУГ: I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re our age!
НЕДРУГ: So ah, we on for tomorrow?
МОНИКА: Absolutely! Now get out of here you! Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, kinda.
НЕДРУГ: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
ДЖОУИ: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. Nothing.
НЕДРУГ: Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.
НЕДРУГ: I have a question about this scene.
НЕДРУГ: Yes?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.
НЕДРУГ: Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, II don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.
НЕДРУГ: It doesn’t say that in the script.
ДЖОУИ: It does in mine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?
РОСС: You bug me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
РОСС: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You didn’t just break up.
РОСС: Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
РОСС: Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
РОСС: She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
РОСС: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop what?!
РОСС: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice! I need juice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! You can’t!
РОСС: Look, they must be stopped!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this! You are surprisingly strong!
РОСС: I need juice! People need juice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look man!
РОСС: People need juice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen to me!
РОСС: Juice, I need.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.
РОСС: Yeah, okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
РОСС: It’s just I miss her so much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know.
НЕДРУГ: Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what?
НЕДРУГ: No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can’t do this.
НЕДРУГ: Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.
НЕДРУГ: Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I sayI say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
НЕДРУГ: That’s okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You sure?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
НЕДРУГ: has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, can I ask you something?
МОНИКА: Sure.
НЕДРУГ: Where are we?
МОНИКА: Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.
НЕДРУГ: Just tell me the truth.
МОНИКА: Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago?
МОНИКА: So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. I know that.
МОНИКА: I so wanna be attracted to you.
НЕДРУГ: But you’re not. Okay, good.
МОНИКА: I’m sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘cause it’s not so bad.
МОНИКА: It’s not?
НЕДРУГ: I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
МОНИКА: Well, um, look II don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you wanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda depressing.
НЕДРУГ: And the man who made all this possible. Mr. Peter Becker.
НЕДРУГ: One second.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wasn’t doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?
ДЖОУИ: Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
ДЖОУИ: God, I just, I hate her! I hate her! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
НЕДРУГ: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
ДЖОУИ: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. Nothing.
НЕДРУГ: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
НЕДРУГ: Well, that was ah.
ДЖОУИ: Better?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, Kate?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: You ah, you forgot your shoes.
НЕДРУГ: I’m probably gonna need those. Huh?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, listen you ah.
НЕДРУГ: Hmm?
ДЖОУИ: feel like getting a cup of coffee?
НЕДРУГ: Umm.
НЕДРУГ: Kate?
НЕДРУГ: Yep.
НЕДРУГ: You ready to go?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Very nice. Very nice.
НЕДРУГ: So umm, I’ll see you tomorrow, huh?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
ФИБИ: Hey! Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
ФИБИ: It isn’t?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.
ФИБИ: Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey, Rach, how was work?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
МОНИКА: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and.
МОНИКА: Something wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Nothing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
ФИБИ: Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about things that are already gold?
ФИБИ: Ahh, his work is done.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, let’s play my game now.
ФИБИ: Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-liveredDRAW!
