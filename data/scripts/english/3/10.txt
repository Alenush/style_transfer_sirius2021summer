ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh, I don't, I don't know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
НЕДРУГ: Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eh, do you believe that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
РОСС: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
РОСС: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl, is not a backhand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was shrieking, like a Marine.
РОСС: All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
МОНИКА: You broke a little girl's leg?!
РОСС: I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were you around ten-ish?
РОСС: Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
МОНИКА: Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm gonna get back to retraining.
РОСС: All right, see you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look out kids, he's coming!
ДЖОУИ: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
ФИБИ: Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
ДЖОУИ: What? Me having a job?
ФИБИ: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
ФИБИ: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
НЕДРУГ: and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
НЕДРУГ: What if you put them here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
НЕДРУГ: They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
НЕДРУГ: It's all right. Sweetheart.
РОСС: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
РОСС: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
РОСС: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
НЕДРУГ: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
РОСС: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
НЕДРУГ: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: So far, I've sold seventy-five.
РОСС: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
НЕДРУГ: Five dollars a box.
РОСС: And what is second prize?
НЕДРУГ: A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
РОСС: Well, that makes sense.
НЕДРУГ: Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
РОСС: Yeah, Sarah, anything.
НЕДРУГ: Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
НЕДРУГ: Yesss?
РОСС: Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
НЕДРУГ: You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
РОСС: No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird.
НЕДРУГ: What does that mean?
РОСС: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
НЕДРУГ: I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
РОСС: No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
НЕДРУГ: I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
РОСС: Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
НЕДРУГ: I can still see you!
РОСС: All right!
ФИБИ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. What, what are you doing here?
ФИБИ: Well, II thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh.
ДЖОУИ: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas.
ФИБИ: Destiny.
ДЖОУИ: Sure.
ФИБИ: Yes.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
ФИБИ: Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
ФИБИ: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
ДЖОУИ: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
ФИБИ: So, what happens to the old guys?
ДЖОУИ: Well, they go into the chipper.
ФИБИ: Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Hey!
РОСС: and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
ДЖОУИ: All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
РОСС: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
РОСС: No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
РОСС: Mon?
МОНИКА: All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. II started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
РОСС: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
МОНИКА: No.
РОСС: Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
МОНИКА: Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
РОСС: I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
МОНИКА: Oh God! I gotta go!
РОСС: Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
НЕДРУГ: And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
ДЖОУИ: Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How, exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I'm also sending out, good thoughts.
ДЖОУИ: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The fear?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because, I'm too afraid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer. Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can't I just look at the handles on them?
НЕДРУГ: You would think.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gunther, I quit.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
РОСС: and 12, 22, 18, four. What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I spelled out boobies.
МОНИКА: Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
РОСС: Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
МОНИКА: What?
РОСС: Monica, I'm cutting you off.
МОНИКА: No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'mI'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
РОСС: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
МОНИКА: Oh God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, how many have you sold so far?
РОСС: Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, how did you do that?
РОСС: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.
РОСС: Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me! On my computer.
РОСС: Well you sure used a large font.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Something else I might have said?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
РОСС: Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I got great news!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Run, Joey! Run for your life!
ДЖОУИ: What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
ДЖОУИ: Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Not a problem.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks.
ДЖОУИ: And now for the great news.
РОСС: What, that wasn't the great news?
ДЖОУИ: Only if you think it's better than this, snow-in-a-can! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
МОНИКА: Christmas cookie?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
НЕДРУГ: Looks good. I'll take it.
ФИБИ: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
НЕДРУГ: It's-it's-it's almost dead!
ФИБИ: Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
НЕДРУГ: II think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
МОНИКА: Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
ФИБИ: Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
МОНИКА: Is this the one that I threw out last year?
ФИБИ: All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
МОНИКА: Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
ФИБИ: Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
МОНИКА: Oh.
РОСС: Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
НЕДРУГ: I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
РОСС: Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
НЕДРУГ: You're a big scrud.
РОСС: What's a scrud?
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
РОСС: I don't have too. I can just look at you.
НЕДРУГ: All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
РОСС: Not nice enough.
НЕДРУГ: Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
РОСС: Good for a scrud.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
РОСС: That's crap! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
НЕДРУГ: Who's next?
РОСС: Hi there!
НЕДРУГ: Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
РОСС: Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious, nuget, diffency.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
РОСС: Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! How'd the interview go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
РОСС: Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
ФИБИ: This is the worst Christmas ever.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin, swans.
РОСС: That word was swans.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
ФИБИ: Oh! Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Merry Christmas!
ФИБИ: You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got the job!
НЕДРУГ: That's great! Hey! Excellent!
ФИБИ: Oh, God bless us, everyone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Should I tell her I ordered tea?
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
НЕДРУГ: Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
РОСС: I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!
НЕДРУГ: Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
РОСС: Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
ДЖОУИ: Ten, ten, nine, nine, nine, eight, eight, eight. Okay, Blast off!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
РОСС: Oh no! An asteroid!
