ФИБИ: Like a date type person? 
РОСС: Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.

НЕДРУГ: So. How’d you guys meet? 
НЕДРУГ: Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle. 
НЕДРУГ: How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation? 
ДЖОУИ: No, they-they weren’t in the play. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We’re not actors. 
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could I borrow it? 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Remember me? 
РОСС: Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, I’m gonna go. 
РОСС: Go? Why? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know. Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream. 
РОСС: But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream. 
НЕДРУГ: Good bye Ross. 
РОСС: Uh, oh-ho bye. 
НЕДРУГ: Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la, Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production. 
ДЖОУИ: Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha! 
НЕДРУГ: Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is Thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother’s crab cakes! Excuse me!! 
ДЖОУИ: Anyone mind if I save this?

ДЖОУИ: Hey! Are you okay? 
НЕДРУГ: Fabulous. 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do? 
НЕДРУГ: Become a drama critic! 
НЕДРУГ: I am hurt! A plague on both your houses! 
НЕДРУГ: By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, classy. 
НЕДРУГ: Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.

ДЖОУИ: Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again. 
НЕДРУГ: What? So you never went out with an actress before? 
ДЖОУИ: Kate, do you even like me? 
НЕДРУГ: Of course I do. 
ДЖОУИ: Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy. Why can’t I just pick someone like you?

МОНИКА: Joey, you had the night! 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
МОНИКА: When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
