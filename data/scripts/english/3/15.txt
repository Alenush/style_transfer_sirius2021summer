МОНИКА: Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!
НЕДРУГ: Can I help you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-oh.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
НЕДРУГ: Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, that hurt us.

ДЖОУИ: We'll be there.
НЕДРУГ: Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, rock on.
НЕДРУГ: He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
ФИБИ: Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here.
НЕДРУГ: Your eyes are very pretty.
ФИБИ: Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!
НЕДРУГ: He would like to kiss you.
ФИБИ: Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Oy!
ФИБИ: See there it is right there.
МОНИКА: Wow! It's small.
ФИБИ: Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
МОНИКА: So you had fun, huh?
ФИБИ: Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
МОНИКА: No.
РОСС: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РОСС: What is ah, Rach in her room?
МОНИКА: Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
РОСС: Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
МОНИКА: All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel.
РОСС: What's that on the bottom?
МОНИКА: Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello.
РОСС: Hey, honey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi.
РОСС: Hey, what's going on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
РОСС: What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
ФИБИ: Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
МОНИКА: Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
ФИБИ: Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, 10:30.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What time is it now?
ДЖОУИ: 4:30.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Vividly.
ДЖОУИ: She was kidding about that right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, III think so. Yeah, II think so.
ДЖОУИ: God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
ДЖОУИ: Dude, I don't know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was kidding.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was. But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.
ДЖОУИ: Ah! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we, y'know each would, y'know be?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And. What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
РОСС: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! My God, what are you doing here?
РОСС: Well you said you couldn't go out so.
НЕДРУГ: You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but II got a crisis.
РОСС: Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
РОСС: Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I don't, hmm. Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
НЕДРУГ: I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
РОСС: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I.
РОСС: Pepper?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: None for me.
РОСС: Okay sorry, whew.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's. Oh my God!
РОСС: Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
РОСС: I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
РОСС: Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't have ten minutes!
РОСС: What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Ross! I told you I don't!
РОСС: Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
РОСС: Yeah, but wait.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good bye!
НЕДРУГ: Actually, that's our three hole punch.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier.
РОСС: No, hey, well, II completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
РОСС: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
РОСС: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I told you, I didn't have the time!
РОСС: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit me job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
РОСС: No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just a job!
РОСС: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that.
РОСС: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well neither do I!
РОСС: Is this about Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God.
РОСС: Okay, it's not, it's not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
РОСС: Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I don't know. Look, maybe we should take a break.
РОСС: Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. A break from us.
НЕДРУГ: And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
РОСС: Oh, hi Chloe.
НЕДРУГ: I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that's the only colour that comes in.
НЕДРУГ: Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
РОСС: Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
МОНИКА: Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez vous couchet avec moi, saiz soi. Why? What did I say?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
ФИБИ: Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
ФИБИ: You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
НЕДРУГ: Boutros Boutros Gali.
НЕДРУГ: He says he was too.
ФИБИ: Interesting.
НЕДРУГ: So I was wondering.
ФИБИ: Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
НЕДРУГ: Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So your a chef?
МОНИКА: I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, really.
ФИБИ: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
МОНИКА: Well, I was having a conversation.
ФИБИ: Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
МОНИКА: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
ФИБИ: That would be great. Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi. It's Mark.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: What? Is it my breath?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Well, umm.
НЕДРУГ: Rach, are you okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I'm fine.
НЕДРУГ: You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
НЕДРУГ: All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
НЕДРУГ: It's for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Okay, bye.
ДЖОУИ: So what are you gonna do?
РОСС: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
РОСС: Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? What happened to him?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
НЕДРУГ: Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
НЕДРУГ: Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello.
РОСС: Hi! It's me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
РОСС: Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, what do you want to drink?
РОСС: Who's that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nobody.
НЕДРУГ: Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
РОСС: Is that Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, honey, look he just came over to.
РОСС: Yeah! Got it!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
РОСС: Ah, that's okay, thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
РОСС: Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
НЕДРУГ: And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog, In seven languages.
МОНИКА: Oh. Can I have a tissue?
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
НЕДРУГ: Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
ФИБИ: Well, tell him, apology accepted.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
ФИБИ: Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
МОНИКА: Hey, the man's dog just died.
НЕДРУГ: I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
МОНИКА: It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, plate?
ФИБИ: Plate! Yes, plate.
НЕДРУГ: Plate. Plate. Plate.
ФИБИ: See, we don't need them.
НЕДРУГ: Plate?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РОСС: I like this song.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
РОСС: Oh, no, no.
НЕДРУГ: What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
НЕДРУГ: Still no smile?
НЕДРУГ: Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan.
ФИБИ: Ameri-can.
НЕДРУГ: Ameri-ccan.
ФИБИ: Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
НЕДРУГ: Everybody!
