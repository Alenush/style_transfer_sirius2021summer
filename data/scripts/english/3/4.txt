НЕДРУГ: Monica and Rachel's: everyone is there and they are watching an info-mercial that stars Joey.
НЕДРУГ: Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
ФИБИ: Oh, oh! It's on again!
ДЖОУИ: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
НЕДРУГ: Shhhh!
НЕДРУГ: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
НЕДРУГ: And there is Kevin.
ДЖОУИ: Can we please turn this off?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo way, Kevin.
НЕДРУГ: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
РОСС: Are you intrigued?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
НЕДРУГ: Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's official there are no good movies.
НЕДРУГ: Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
МОНИКА: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, man. What's up?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
ФИБИ: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!
ДЖОУИ: How is it you?
ФИБИ: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. III meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
ДЖОУИ: Yep, that's my audition.
МОНИКА: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
ФИБИ: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
НЕДРУГ: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
ДЖОУИ: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
ФИБИ: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
ФИБИ: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh.
ДЖОУИ: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
ФИБИ: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
ДЖОУИ: Hang up, hang up.
ФИБИ: 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is anybody else scared?
ФИБИ: 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
МОНИКА: Oh, now you want a pad.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
НЕДРУГ: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
НЕДРУГ: He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
РОСС: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
НЕДРУГ: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
НЕДРУГ: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
РОСС: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
РОСС: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
МОНИКА: I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
ДЖОУИ: I love that movie.
МОНИКА: There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
РОСС: And that's bad because, you hate chicken piccata?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Noo.
РОСС: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Men are unbelievable.
МОНИКА: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
МОНИКА: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you know about that?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
РОСС: Where there is no fear of commitment.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do we have any. Do we have any thoughts here?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs, get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Amazingly, that makes sense.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You think?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
ФИБИ: Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
ДЖОУИ: Come on baby, come on!
ФИБИ: 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Very nice touch.
ФИБИ: 'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next. Op, went through a tunnel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Unbelievable.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you so much.
ФИБИ: It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
ДЖОУИ: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
ФИБИ: Two?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
ФИБИ: Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right.
ДЖОУИ: Nooo, four.
НЕДРУГ: So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you didn't have to do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
НЕДРУГ: We should?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
НЕДРУГ: I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
НЕДРУГ: You probably want us to move in together?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It doesn't scare me!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and II should just, um.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, III just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, this will help.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
НЕДРУГ: Uff.
МОНИКА: That is never good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then I got all needy and clingy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She said she'd call me.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God.
МОНИКА: Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
МОНИКА: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you don't think I'm terminal?
МОНИКА: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
НЕДРУГ: Nooo!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
МОНИКА: She has to know that your not ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G. I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: G. I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
ДЖОУИ: G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
РОСС: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U. S. oil interests overseas!
НЕДРУГ: Go Joe!
ФИБИ: Helloo! Oh!
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! There you are!
ФИБИ: No it's not, sorry.
ДЖОУИ: But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those. pants.
ДЖОУИ: Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
ФИБИ: Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
ДЖОУИ: It's okay, these things happen.
ФИБИ: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
ДЖОУИ: I'm, I'm okay. See.
ФИБИ: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
ДЖОУИ: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
ФИБИ: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
ДЖОУИ: They actually said that?
ФИБИ: Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.
ФИБИ: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
РОСС: You'll never get me, Joe!
НЕДРУГ: No, thank you. Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello, Janice.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
НЕДРУГ: Are you being British?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. Not anymore.
НЕДРУГ: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
НЕДРУГ: Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
НЕДРУГ: Where is this party?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here in Chelsea.
НЕДРУГ: Who's party is it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A woman's.
НЕДРУГ: What woman?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chelsea.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I be that guy?
ФИБИ: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, shoot.
ФИБИ: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
ДЖОУИ: I didn't get it?
ФИБИ: No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, what else?
ФИБИ: Um, the offBroadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb'.
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
ФИБИ: Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
ДЖОУИ: Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
ФИБИ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
ФИБИ: Yeah, no, I understand.
ДЖОУИ: You do, thanks.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute.
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
ФИБИ: Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
ДЖОУИ: That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
МОНИКА: My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it is.
МОНИКА: You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shhh. I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
МОНИКА: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello!
МОНИКА: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, and grumpy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got stupid, and, and scared, and. stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you too.
МОНИКА: Aw, it's soo unfair.
НЕДРУГ: G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
РОСС: Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
НЕДРУГ: What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
РОСС: Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
МОНИКА: What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
РОСС: What?
МОНИКА: Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
РОСС: What are you talking about?
МОНИКА: The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
РОСС: Okay, you are totally making this up.
МОНИКА: How can you not remember? You made us call you. Bea.
РОСС: Oh God.
НЕДРУГ: I've literally never been this happy.
МОНИКА: Wasn't there a little song?
НЕДРУГ: Oh please God, let there be a song.
РОСС: There was no song. There was no song!
МОНИКА: 'I am Bea.'
РОСС: Okay.
МОНИКА: 'I drink tea.'
РОСС: Okay, that's, that's enough.
МОНИКА: '. Won't you, won't you, won't you. '
РОСС: Won't you dance around with me.
МОНИКА: A-ha!
НЕДРУГ: 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with.' Ohhh!
НЕДРУГ: Ross!
