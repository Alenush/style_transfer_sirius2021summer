РЕЙЧЕЛ: So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
МОНИКА: Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, they took my idea!
МОНИКА: That was you?!
ФИБИ: Yeah! Okay, here you go.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, are you guys okay?
НЕДРУГ: Are you all right?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
ДЖОУИ: Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РОСС: I’m gonna be on TV!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No way!
РОСС: Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
РОСС: Thanks. You ready to go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Saw a girl with that vest.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks.
НЕДРУГ: While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won’t live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Skates!
МОНИКА: Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?
НЕДРУГ: Well.
МОНИКА: Oh, what’d ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure, that’d be great.
МОНИКА: Regular or decaf?
НЕДРУГ: Ah, which ever is closest.
МОНИКА: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: So ask me what I did today.
МОНИКА: So what did you do today Pete?
НЕДРУГ: I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
МОНИКА: What?! Oh.
МОНИКА: Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
МОНИКА: I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
МОНИКА: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? IIII can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
МОНИКА: Oh, please.
МОНИКА: What? Honey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
МОНИКА: Oh God, I’m so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow!
МОНИКА: Oh God!
РОСС: Hey, you guys! Guess what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Got a job on a river boat?
РОСС: Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
РОСС: Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
РОСС: You like it right?
МОНИКА: Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, come here!
МОНИКА: What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
РОСС: Okay, good bye!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
ФИБИ: Umm, oh, about three months.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: I got you something! Open it! Open it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. It’s a chicken.
ДЖОУИ: It’s cute, huh?
ФИБИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
ФИБИ: Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, well no problem there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Easy Lenny.
НЕДРУГ: So? I mean have you thought about it?
МОНИКА: Okay. Here’s the thing.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?
МОНИКА: I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me.
НЕДРУГ: Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.
МОНИКА: Huh?
НЕДРУГ: No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
МОНИКА: Oh?
НЕДРУГ: Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
МОНИКА: Oh, that’s great! I mean I’mI’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
НЕДРУГ: I guess you can.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
НЕДРУГ: All right.
МОНИКА: Okay. Can you give me a little push?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure. Good luck!
МОНИКА: I’m quitting! Woo-hoo! I’m okay! I’m all right!
ФИБИ: Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
НЕДРУГ: Why would you say that?
ФИБИ: ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and.
НЕДРУГ: You’re good. You’re good!
ФИБИ: Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
НЕДРУГ: Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?
ФИБИ: Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
НЕДРУГ: Thanks a lot.
ФИБИ: No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: How’s she doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She?
ДЖОУИ: Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know. I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
ДЖОУИ: Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me?
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don’t think I get up when you get up?
ДЖОУИ: Ohhh, here it comes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
ДЖОУИ: That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know what you meant! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll take her back tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, II have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?
ДЖОУИ: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
РОСС: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oww!
РОСС: Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oww!
РОСС: Oh my God, is that still.

РОСС: Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, I’m fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!
РОСС: Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.
РОСС: And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.
РОСС: Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
РОСС: Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, either help me or go.

РОСС: Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, just sweep it.
РОСС: I’m sweeping.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right.
РОСС: Sweep, sweep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t.
РОСС: What? What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
РОСС: No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
РОСС: Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Blow it.
РОСС: Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sophisticated like a hooker?
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
ФИБИ: Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
МОНИКА: I know.
ФИБИ: Ooh, I have to tell you something.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: But I can’t tell you.
МОНИКА: Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
ФИБИ: Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
МОНИКА: Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
ФИБИ: No.
МОНИКА: Does it have to do with Joey?
ФИБИ: No.
МОНИКА: Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
ФИБИ: No, but let’s come back to that later!
РОСС: There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure.
РОСС: Yep?

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
РОСС: Sure, okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t want you to see me naked!
РОСС: Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, II sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird.
РОСС: Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! Stop that!
РОСС: Ah, I’m sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
РОСС: Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
РОСС: Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen. Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.

ФИБИ: I, but you’re so close! No!
МОНИКА: Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?
ФИБИ: Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!
ДЖОУИ: That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
МОНИКА: I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.

МОНИКА: Pete.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
МОНИКА: No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.
НЕДРУГ: Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
МОНИКА: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.
НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, yeah. I mean. If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.
МОНИКА: Okay, bye.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry things didn’t work out.
МОНИКА: All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?
РОСС: Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.

РОСС: I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?
РОСС: Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe you.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is the sweetest thing, I just.
РОСС: You should get some sleep.
