РОСС: So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out..... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda. 
МОНИКА: Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best. 
НЕДРУГ: What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife. 
ФИБИ: Who's singing? 
РОСС: Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie. 
МОНИКА: I was always Joanne. 
ДЖОУИ: Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood? 
ФИБИ: Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King! 
ДЖОУИ: Booo!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel! 
НЕДРУГ: Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine. 
НЕДРУГ: 'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What a wank! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses. 
МОНИКА: I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.' 
РОСС: We? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay. 
РОСС: Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, my father doesn't hate you. 
РОСС: Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll go. 
РОСС: Fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. 
РОСС: Hi Gunther. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we'll see! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you guys! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Guess what? 
РОСС: What? 
ДЖОУИ: I got a gig! 
НЕДРУГ: Yay!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: What's the part? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension. 
РОСС: Come on! That's great. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community. 
РОСС: Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students. 
ДЖОУИ: I know! 
ФИБИ: Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler. 
МОНИКА: Not at these prices. 
ФИБИ: Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo! 
МОНИКА: Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy. 
ФИБИ: Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends. 
ДЖОУИ: Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.' 
ФИБИ: Ooooh, nice. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children. 
ФИБИ: Oh, yay! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller? 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Sign here. 
ФИБИ: Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler. 
ДЖОУИ: You want me to lie to Chandler? 
ФИБИ: Is that a problem? 
ДЖОУИ: No. 
ФИБИ: Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough. 
ДЖОУИ: Ahh! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey now! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding. 
ФИБИ: Oh! Oh! Oh! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, great. 
ФИБИ: Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: 'Kay, put your head back. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. I can't see. 
ФИБИ: All right, I have ya. Oh God. 
НЕДРУГ: Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller? 
ФИБИ: Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Gotcha. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Daddy! 
НЕДРУГ: This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You remember Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: Um-hmm. 
РОСС: Nice to see you again Dr. Green. 
НЕДРУГ: So! How's the library? 
РОСС: Ugh, museum. 
НЕДРУГ: What happened to the library? 
РОСС: There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one. 
НЕДРУГ: You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three. 
РОСС: Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster. 
НЕДРУГ: What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library. 
РОСС: It's not a library... 
НЕДРУГ: I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. 
РОСС: So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat. 
НЕДРУГ: They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat? 
РОСС: It gives it a nice antiquey look. 
НЕДРУГ: Rust, is boat cancer, Ross. 
РОСС: Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
РОСС: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw honey stop! It's not that bad. 
РОСС: Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. That's Daddy. 
РОСС: That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers. 
РОСС: So? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change. 
РОСС: You really serve people sneezers? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well um, I don't. 
НЕДРУГ: You kids ready? 
РОСС: Thanks again, Dr. Green. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt. 
РОСС: Oh, ah, you don't need that. 
НЕДРУГ: Why not? 
РОСС: The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness. 
НЕДРУГ: What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh? 
РОСС: Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that. 
РОСС: I know. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, you think I'm cheap? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't. 
РОСС: Nothing I do means anything, really. 
НЕДРУГ: This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. 
РОСС: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Mr. Trib. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Guess what, I got an audition! 
ДЖОУИ: Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud. 
НЕДРУГ: I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it? 
ДЖОУИ: You bet! What's the part? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone. 
РОСС: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. 
РОСС: Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. 
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? 
ФИБИ: I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um. yeah. 
ФИБИ: I am soo dead. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. 
РОСС: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here. 
РОСС: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? 
РОСС: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! 
РОСС: Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels. 
МОНИКА: What's this? 
ФИБИ: Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom! 
МОНИКА: This is not the bed I ordered! 
ФИБИ: I know, you must've won like a contest or something! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! 
МОНИКА: Why is this car in my bedroom? 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it... 
МОНИКА: When did I sign for it? 
ФИБИ: When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open! 
МОНИКА: Did you make brownies today? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Knock, knock. 
МОНИКА: Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp. 
ФИБИ: It's Monica's bed. What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. It's a racecar. 
ФИБИ: So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress? 
МОНИКА: Sometimes I have bad dreams. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa. That was really good. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks, any suggestions? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You told him to play the boxer gay!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I-I might've said supergay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You totally screwed him over. 
МОНИКА: Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this? 
ДЖОУИ: Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part. 
ФИБИ: Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Daddy. 
НЕДРУГ: Baby. Ross. 
РОСС: Dr. Green. How are you? 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for dinner last night. 
РОСС: Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here? 
РОСС: Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here. 
РОСС: Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that.... 
НЕДРУГ: Ross? What's with the neck? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor... 
НЕДРУГ: You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa! 
РОСС: Thank you! That's what I keep saying. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. 
РОСС: Uh. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that's his last name. 
РОСС: And his first name. 
НЕДРУГ: He's Bobby Bobby? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's Robert Bobby. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And um, excuse me, he helps me. 
РОСС: Oh-ho please. Ask her how? 
НЕДРУГ: What do you need help for? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh God! 
РОСС: Argue with that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine! 
РОСС: I know that! 
НЕДРУГ: So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, let her? 
РОСС: What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?! 
РОСС: Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice? 
НЕДРУГ: I'd love some juice. Thanks. 
РОСС: Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet. 
РОСС: Excellent! 
ДЖОУИ: There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, may I help you? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. 
НЕДРУГ: Nobody sees the king! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You can't go back there! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
