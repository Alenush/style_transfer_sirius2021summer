ДЖОУИ: All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Taste it. 
ДЖОУИ: Yep, it's fat. I drank fat! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago. 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, mister tux! 
РОСС: Why aren't you guys dressed? 
ДЖОУИ: We have a half hour. 
РОСС: No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight. 
ДЖОУИ: Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed. 
РОСС: Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy. 
РОСС: Really. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi. 
РОСС: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How come you didn't come over earlier? 
РОСС: 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Ross, want some cider? 
РОСС: No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I just have to get dressed. 
РОСС: Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing. 
ДЖОУИ: Glass of fat? 
ДЖОУИ: What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech? 
РОСС: No! Do you wanna hear it? 
ДЖОУИ: Am I in it? 
РОСС: Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey. 
ФИБИ: Hello. 
РОСС: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! 
РОСС: Wow, hello! You look great! 
ФИБИ: Thank you! I know, though. 
РОСС: You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up. 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're in my seat. 
ДЖОУИ: How is this your seat? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'Cause I was sitting there. 
ДЖОУИ: But then you left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back. 
ДЖОУИ: What's the big deal, sit somewhere else. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo... 
РОСС: You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So.. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!! 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Ooh, Phoebe, you look great! 
ФИБИ: All right all ready. 
МОНИКА: Ooh, are you gonna do magic? 
РОСС: That's, that's funny. Change! 
МОНИКА: Hang on a second I just got in. 
РОСС: Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late. 
ФИБИ: We could not, would not want to wait. 
РОСС: Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts. 
МОНИКА: Has somebody been drinking my fat? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear? 
ФИБИ: I don't know, you might be the first one. 
МОНИКА: Rach, did you check the machine? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up. 
ДЖОУИ: All right! You can have the chair. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my, would you look at that! 
ФИБИ: "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky? 
РОСС: "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: Nevermind. 
НЕДРУГ: "Monica, it's Richard. Call me." 
МОНИКА: Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?! 
РОСС: It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep? 
МОНИКА: What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old. 
РОСС: Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did? 
МОНИКА: Huh? 
РОСС: I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! 
ФИБИ: Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys! 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry Phoebe. 
ДЖОУИ: I'm so sorry. 
ФИБИ: What am I gonna do? 
РОСС: No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out humus?! What gets out humus?! 
ФИБИ: Monica, Monica, you know what gets out humus. 
МОНИКА: If it is a new message, what is he calling to say? 
ФИБИ: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy. 
МОНИКА: So, should I call him back? 
НЕДРУГ: Noo! NO! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! 
РОСС: Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened? 
ФИБИ: Humus. I got the humus. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket? 
ФИБИ: That won't go with this dress though. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on. 
РОСС: No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress? 
МОНИКА: I called him. 
НЕДРУГ: Nooo. 
МОНИКА: Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy? 
ФИБИ: Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place. 
МОНИКА: Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough. 
ДЖОУИ: Monica, how are you gonna do that? 
МОНИКА: I know the code to his answering machine. 
РОСС: Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing. 
НЕДРУГ: "Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone." 
НЕДРУГ: "You have two new messages." 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.' 
МОНИКА: "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy." 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy. 
НЕДРУГ: Ola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Now she sounded breezy. 
МОНИКА: He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone. 
ФИБИ: Monica, you don't know that. 
МОНИКА: Well, who's voice was that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's. 
МОНИКА: Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle? 
РОСС: Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab. 
МОНИКА: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?! 
РОСС: You don't, you don't know what your wearing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night. 
РОСС: Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Mim, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!" 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing? 
ДЖОУИ: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The cushions are the essence of the chair! 
ДЖОУИ: That's right! I'm taking the essence. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room. 
РОСС: Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep. 
РОСС: Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days. 
ФИБИ: Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight. 
ФИБИ: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi! 
РОСС: Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We used them as pillows when we went camping. 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The sheep. 
РОСС: Hey, what you do on your own time... 
ДЖОУИ: Where's my underwear?! 
РОСС: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He took my essence! 
РОСС: Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now? 
ДЖОУИ: Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now. 
РОСС: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight? 
ДЖОУИ: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you, what are you gonna *show* me my clothes? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, opposite, is opposite! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's got nothing! 
ФИБИ: Okay, I'm ready. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, aaaah! 
ФИБИ: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.' 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you supporting? 
ФИБИ: Duh!! Christmas! 
РОСС: Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? 
РОСС: Just, just, just pick one! 
ФИБИ: Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants? 
РОСС: Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I... 
РОСС: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. 
РОСС: Thank you! 
МОНИКА: Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to. 
РОСС: It was, it was her voice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place. 
НЕДРУГ: Ola! Hello. Hello? 
МОНИКА: Okay. That was her right? 
ФИБИ: Definitely. 
МОНИКА: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now. 
РОСС: Yay! 
ФИБИ: I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. 
МОНИКА: Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about? 
МОНИКА: Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back. 
РОСС: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick. 
МОНИКА: Okay, fine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They got a phone in there, right? 
ФИБИ: Okay, we're on it. We're on it. 
РОСС: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not gonna gooo. 
РОСС: You're not going to go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. 
РОСС: How, how, um how can you not be going? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going. 
РОСС: Um, you know, just out of curiosity... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. 
РОСС: Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's fine. 
РОСС: No, but, your-your mad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not mad. 
РОСС: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm just not going. 
РОСС: Your not going. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. 
РОСС: Okay. You know that I-I have to go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, hum. 
РОСС: Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
РОСС: No, because your not upset. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. 
РОСС: About the yelling. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right, and the humiliating. 
РОСС: Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, hum. 
РОСС: We're good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. 
РОСС: Okay. Honey? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, Ross. 
РОСС: I love you. 
ФИБИ: Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! 
ДЖОУИ: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I *be* wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooo-ooh! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
РОСС: Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jeez, what a baby. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed. 
РОСС: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there. 
ДЖОУИ: You could drink the fat. 
РОСС: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think you *should* drink the fat. 
ДЖОУИ: Yaaaay! 
РОСС: Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do. 
ФИБИ: Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out. 
РОСС: I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go! 
РОСС: You will?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were really gonna do that, weren't you? 
РОСС: Well, yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were gonna drink the fat. 
ДЖОУИ: Let's see what else he'll do! 
РОСС: How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop it. Stop it! 
ФИБИ: Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, this is Richard. 
НЕДРУГ: You have three new messages. 
МОНИКА: Not any more! 
НЕДРУГ: Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone. 
МОНИКА: Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye. 
НЕДРУГ: Your outgoing message has now been changed. 
МОНИКА: Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!! 
МОНИКА: "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!! 
ФИБИ: How did you do that? 
МОНИКА: I don't know! 
НЕДРУГ: Good-bye. 
МОНИКА: Noooo!!!! 
РОСС: Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go! 
МОНИКА: Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself. 
РОСС: Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds. 
РОСС: So we're a little late. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way.... 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm going commando, too. 
РОСС: Awwww!!! 
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. 
РОСС: Wow! What a pleasure. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me. Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, your kind of sitting in my seat. 
НЕДРУГ: What do you mean, your seat? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, I was sitting there. 
НЕДРУГ: But, you got up! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But, I never left the room! 
НЕДРУГ: But, you left the chair area. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
