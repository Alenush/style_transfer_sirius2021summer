ДЖОУИ: Can I see the comics?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is the New York Times.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, may I see the comics?
МОНИКА: Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are. He’s meeting us here.
МОНИКА: No! Rachel is meeting us here.
ФИБИ: Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
ФИБИ: Why? What happened now?
ДЖОУИ: Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
ДЖОУИ: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
ФИБИ: Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.
ДЖОУИ: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
ФИБИ: Whoa! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
ФИБИ: Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy.
ДЖОУИ: I had the same dream!
ФИБИ: Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I had the opposite dream.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
МОНИКА: It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
МОНИКА: Okay, let’s go! Let’s hit the road!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Let’s get the show on it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
МОНИКА: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Closer than here?
ФИБИ: Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let’s scidaddle.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.
ФИБИ: Okay, your highness.
ФИБИ: Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is he here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
ФИБИ: No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hm-mm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh!
МОНИКА: We’re sorry honey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s okay.
ДЖОУИ: Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And heels.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair.
ФИБИ: Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah.
МОНИКА: Very bad.
ФИБИ: Chandler what are you doing?!
МОНИКА: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: You’re smoking again?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.
ФИБИ: Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
МОНИКА: Weren’t you nine?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.
ФИБИ: Him? Him, Ross?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?! I mean I’m playing by the rules.
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely, yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, shut up! You’re not my real Mom!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
ФИБИ: Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.
РОСС: Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
РОСС: Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it’ll be great!
ДЖОУИ: It’ll be great for next weekend.
РОСС: No, no, no, this weekend guys!
ДЖОУИ: It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, it’ll be grrreat.
РОСС: What’s going on?
ФИБИ: Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin.
РОСС: So, for the whole weekend?
МОНИКА: We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
РОСС: Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
ФИБИ: Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.
МОНИКА: Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.
РОСС: What a pity stay?
МОНИКА: No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
РОСС: Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
МОНИКА: Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
ДЖОУИ: What? Mine aren’t tinted.
ФИБИ: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ФИБИ: What does the sign say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Beam me up Jesus.
ФИБИ: No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well, then, II have to go to the bathroom.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ФИБИ: Please!
МОНИКА: No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooo.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, now I have to go!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
МОНИКА: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Ow!
ФИБИ: Aren’t you gonna go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Thank you.
МОНИКА: No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ Well, if everybody’s going.
ФИБИ: No, y'know what don’t close it ‘cause the, keys, are in there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!
ДЖОУИ: What’s going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My lighter’s in there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Damn! The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
ДЖОУИ: Relax okay, III can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
МОНИКА: So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?
ДЖОУИ: Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
МОНИКА: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ДЖОУИ: Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
МОНИКА: Please!
ДЖОУИ: Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
НЕДРУГ: No, not getting my bra!
ДЖОУИ: If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
ФИБИ: Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.
МОНИКА: These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, III actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
МОНИКА: All right then, your bra would still be big.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I stuff outside the bra.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.
ФИБИ: All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
ФИБИ: Okay, there.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.
ДЖОУИ: And there you go!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeahhhhh!
МОНИКА: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: At least let me smoke it to the good part.
ФИБИ: Okay. Oh, no!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what’s it, what’s going on?
ФИБИ: Yeah, this has happened before.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you know how to fix it?
ФИБИ: Yep. Put more gas in.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, what are you doing here?
РОСС: Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M A S H and half the hostages coming home?
НЕДРУГ: Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
РОСС: Where’s Ben?
НЕДРУГ: He’s sleeping.
РОСС: Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
НЕДРУГ: Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary.
РОСС: Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
НЕДРУГ: It’s not that kind of anniversary.
РОСС: Ah! Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Sooo! Anyway.
РОСС: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
НЕДРУГ: Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
РОСС: Yeah, well.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
РОСС: Oh yeah, I’d love that.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, great! Me too.
РОСС: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
ФИБИ: Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great!
ФИБИ: Yeah, what town are we near?
МОНИКА: Freemont. WestWestmont, ah Westburg?
ФИБИ: Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
ФИБИ: Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
ФИБИ: Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don’t do that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
МОНИКА: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
ФИБИ: But if.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.
ФИБИ: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
МОНИКА: So the going for help went well?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
МОНИКА: Then why are you smoking?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it’s very unsettling.
РОСС: right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
РОСС: 717? Where’s 717? Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?
НЕДРУГ: No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.
ФИБИ: Ross, thank God.
РОСС: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
ФИБИ: I ate a bug.
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up.
ФИБИ: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.
РОСС: Oh, now you want a favour?
ФИБИ: Yes, please.
РОСС: Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
РОСС: No, I’m not gonna pick them up.
НЕДРУГ: Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
РОСС: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to.
НЕДРУГ: Look, III am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
РОСС: Yeah, you’re right.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
РОСС: We were on a break! Okay! We were, we were, yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you.
НЕДРУГ: You slept with another woman?
РОСС: Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, done.
МОНИКА: What’s ‘pleh’?
ДЖОУИ: That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
МОНИКА: Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op, op, car! Car! Ugh!
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is he doing here?!
РОСС: He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
НЕДРУГ: No! Come on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! Fine! Fine.
ДЖОУИ: Arrrghh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!
ФИБИ: You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.
ДЖОУИ: Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
МОНИКА: I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ask me what?
МОНИКА: Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
НЕДРУГ: No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
РОСС: Excuse me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s horrible.
РОСС: Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
РОСС: Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
МОНИКА: Here we go again.
ДЖОУИ: II can’t handle this, you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.
РОСС: All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, let’s go!
РОСС: You’re welcome.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
РОСС: We were on a break!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!
РОСС: Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
МОНИКА: I don’t know.
РОСС: That’s what you said last night.
МОНИКА: What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really Joey?
ДЖОУИ: What?
ФИБИ: Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
РОСС: Obviously not to Joey.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
ФИБИ: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look what you’re doing to Chandler! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
ФИБИ: Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: I can.
ФИБИ: Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
ДЖОУИ: Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?
РОСС: Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
ДЖОУИ: Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
РОСС: No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
МОНИКА: All right, we’ll call you when we get back.
РОСС: Okay.
ФИБИ: Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
РОСС: Okay.
ФИБИ: Or, or the rodeo!
РОСС: That would be great.
ФИБИ: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
РОСС: I know!
ФИБИ: Bye!
НЕДРУГ: Ugh. Ross!
РОСС: Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, nooo!
РОСС: Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
НЕДРУГ: You’re a genius, Ross.
РОСС: Yeah, well it came to about 112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
