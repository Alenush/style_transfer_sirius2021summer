ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says "You’re in Sample." 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How’d it go with Pete?! 
ДЖОУИ: Tell us! 
МОНИКА: You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over... 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded. Do you mind if we... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, could you scooch? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, move over just a little bit. 
НЕДРУГ: Keep on scooching. 
МОНИКА: So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm... 
НЕДРУГ: Why? Why?! What’s wrong with me?! 
НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter? 
НЕДРУГ: I have a feelin’... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist. 
НЕДРУГ: How do you know? 
НЕДРУГ: Well y'know, he’s got access. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know it’s that feeling you get, y'know? 
НЕДРУГ: Like when you go bowling and you know you’re in somebody else’s shoes? 
НЕДРУГ: That’s the one. 
ФИБИ: All right, so, so you went to Pete’s... 
РОСС: What happened? 
МОНИКА: I... 
НЕДРУГ: Why is this happening to me?! I don’t know, maybe it’s my wound. 
МОНИКА: Forget it. 
НЕДРУГ: So it’s-it’s not heeled yet? 
НЕДРУГ: No-no, it’s ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any--Oh, there’s the cream. 
НЕДРУГ: Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else. 
НЕДРУГ: What is it, Tim? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife. 
ДЖОУИ: So you’re the gynaecologist? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?! 
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!! 
НЕДРУГ: Thomas, come back here! 
ФИБИ: So Monica, what were you gonna tell us? 
МОНИКА: I have no idea. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker? 
ФИБИ: No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name. 
МОНИКА: He didn’t ask me to marry him. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh. 
ФИБИ: Well then definately don’t take his name. 
МОНИКА: He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy. 
НЕДРУГ: Pete?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?! What is it? 
МОНИКА: I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling. 
ФИБИ: Oh?! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, but without the costumes. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
ДЖОУИ: And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: "They’re are no rules." 
МОНИКА: So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff? 
РОСС: Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking. 
МОНИКА: What’s fish hooking? 
РОСС: Huh, what’s fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste? 
ДЖОУИ: What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath. 
НЕДРУГ: So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but there’s two in martini, so everybody back to my office. 
НЕДРУГ: You! Chuckles! What’s your name? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah... 
НЕДРУГ: No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! 
РОСС: That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right buddy, way to go! 
РОСС: Dude, what are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal. 
ФИБИ: Yeesh, what’d you do about it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom. 
МОНИКА: I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em. 
МОНИКА: Okay, can we please go eat? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. What are we getting? 
МОНИКА: Anything but stew. 
РОСС: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if Joey were president? 
ФИБИ: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ah with who? 
ФИБИ: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again? 
ФИБИ: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! That’s fine. 
ФИБИ: Great! Okay, good for you! 
НЕДРУГ: You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half? 
НЕДРУГ: I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get! 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Monica! Hi honey. 
НЕДРУГ: All right, on the table. 
МОНИКА: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter. 
МОНИКА: Promise me you’ll be careful. 
НЕДРУГ: I promise. 
МОНИКА: Hey, are we still on for tonight? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own... 
НЕДРУГ: No! No boom-boom before big fight! 
МОНИКА: How ‘bout just a boom? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies? 
ФИБИ: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You’re Bonnie? 
НЕДРУГ: I can show you an ID if you want? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that must be it. 
ФИБИ: Well I hope you have fun tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks! You too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You said she was bald. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How could you not tell me that she has hair? 
ФИБИ: I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, well, this is just perfect! 
ФИБИ: Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head! 
ФИБИ: Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, does she have a bad personality? 
ФИБИ: Oh no, Bonnie’s the best! 
НЕДРУГ: Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is with him? 
НЕДРУГ: With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy! 
НЕДРУГ: We never get smacked. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once. 
НЕДРУГ: Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall. 
НЕДРУГ: Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No sir. 
НЕДРУГ: There you go. 
РОСС: Hey! 
МОНИКА: God Ross, what is that? 
РОСС: Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!! 
НЕДРУГ: From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!! 
МОНИКА: I love you, Pete!!! 
НЕДРУГ: And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!! 
МОНИКА: Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge! 
НЕДРУГ: Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him. 
РОСС: Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble. 
РОСС: All right! You go get him! Let’s go! 
НЕДРУГ: Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let’s get it on!! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh. 
МОНИКА: Hey! It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you. 
НЕДРУГ: It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!" 
МОНИКА: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets. 
НЕДРУГ: What, look back? 
МОНИКА: Well, you’re not gonna get going are you? 
НЕДРУГ: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion? 
МОНИКА: Well, no. But... 
НЕДРУГ: Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion. 
МОНИКА: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out! 
НЕДРУГ: Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck. 
МОНИКА: You didn’t know that already? 
НЕДРУГ: Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you. 
МОНИКА: Okay, just get a lot better. Fast. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. That-that was the problem. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey! How long until Pete’s fight? 
МОНИКА: Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. 
РОСС: Hot dog? 
МОНИКА: Four, please. I’m really nervous. Thank you. 
ФИБИ: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? 
РОСС: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, that’s too bad! 
РОСС: No, I-I’m saying I liked her. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. 
РОСС: Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger? 
РОСС: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, the fight’s starting! 
РОСС: Okay, we’ll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. 
ДЖОУИ: Fight’s over! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!! 
НЕДРУГ: Bing! You got those numbers for me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I ah, I didn’t do them. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you forgot? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy! Bing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Doug!! 
НЕДРУГ: Hmm. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Ha! Ahhhhhhh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahhhhh! 
ФИБИ: Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl. 
ФИБИ: No! No! Look at that! It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh... 
ФИБИ: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault. 
ФИБИ: You said it was okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You said she was bald!! 
ФИБИ: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!! 
ФИБИ: Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
ФИБИ: Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
ФИБИ: So? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! 
ФИБИ: Oh no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ФИБИ: Oh, we killed them all. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
НЕДРУГ: It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine. 
МОНИКА: Please tell me you’re stopping now. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror. 
МОНИКА: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up! 
НЕДРУГ: I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid. 
МОНИКА: Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt. 
МОНИКА: Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me. 
НЕДРУГ: Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this. 
МОНИКА: Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. 
НЕДРУГ: Mon-Monica? 
МОНИКА: Yes? 
НЕДРУГ: Could you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow. 
НЕДРУГ: So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn’t have done it without ya. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you, sir. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident. 
НЕДРУГ: Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous. 
НЕДРУГ: Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do! 
НЕДРУГ: Now get on out of here, you! 
НЕДРУГ: Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Run! Run you crazy, rich freak! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I can’t watch this. 
ДЖОУИ: Check it out, he’s winning! Pete’s winning! 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
ДЖОУИ: No-o-o!! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Oh! 
ФИБИ: Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? 
РОСС: Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh!!
