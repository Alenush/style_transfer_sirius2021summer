ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off? 
ДЖОУИ: No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're building a post office? 
ДЖОУИ: No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. My word! Those are snug. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's. 
ДЖОУИ: Power saw kinda got away from me there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Any sign of your brother? 
ФИБИ: No, but he's always late. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I thought you only met him once? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well relax, he'll be here. 
ФИБИ: No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute? 
МОНИКА: No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list. 
ДЖОУИ: Her what? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad. 
РОСС: Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities. 
МОНИКА: So, Chandler, who's on your list? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Monica, who would yours be? 
МОНИКА: First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list. 
ДЖОУИ: It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson. 
РОСС: Spiderman? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hardy Boy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Peter Parker. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What about you honey, who would be on your list? 
РОСС: Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What a geek! 
ФИБИ: Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi. 
ФИБИ: This is everybody. This is Ross.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa!! 
ФИБИ: I'm gonna get coffee. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, how do you guys get anything done? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don't, really. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city. 
ДЖОУИ: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!! 
ДЖОУИ: Calm down, do you want this unit or not? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do NOT want this unit!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine! 
МОНИКА: Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor. 
МОНИКА: Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor? 
ДЖОУИ: Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all. 
МОНИКА: I highly doubt that. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah. 
МОНИКА: I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? 
ДЖОУИ: Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off. 
МОНИКА: That's a little more than I wanted to see. 
ДЖОУИ: Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. 
МОНИКА: I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor. 
ДЖОУИ: Eh! There you go. 
МОНИКА: You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon! 
ФИБИ: Oh, ew! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ФИБИ: Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad. 
НЕДРУГ: What, wait, you mean like this? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. 
НЕДРУГ: Your not doing it. 
ФИБИ: Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that.... 
НЕДРУГ: When's your birthday? 
ФИБИ: Feburary 16th. 
НЕДРУГ: I know a guy who's the 18th. 
ФИБИ: Wow, that's close. When's yours? 
НЕДРУГ: October 25th. 
ФИБИ: That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home? 
НЕДРУГ: Melt stuff. 
РОСС: Okay, I've got three of my five. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Three of your five, what? 
РОСС: Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. 
РОСС: Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? 
РОСС: Okay, Elizabeth Hurely.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. 
РОСС: Susan Sarandon. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. 
РОСС: And!! Isabella Rosselini. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography. 
ФИБИ: Okay so, by melting, you meant melting. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: So is it like art? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone? 
ФИБИ: Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom? 
НЕДРУГ: No, I wanna melt it. 
ФИБИ: Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: G'night, bro. 
НЕДРУГ: G'night. 
ФИБИ: Here. Y'know, just in case. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, excellent. 
МОНИКА: What kind of karate is that? 
ФИБИ: No kind. He just makes it up. 
МОНИКА: So how's it going with you guys? 
ФИБИ: So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and.... 
МОНИКА: Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head. 
ФИБИ: Ah!! 
МОНИКА: Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game. 
ФИБИ: Oh, how do you play the shadow game? 
МОНИКА: Oh, how do you play the shadow game? 
ФИБИ: I just asked you. 
МОНИКА: I just asked you. 
ФИБИ: I don't have time for this. 
МОНИКА: No, that is what the game is. 
ФИБИ: Which you just gave up really quickly. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have you seen Joey? 
МОНИКА: What's the matter? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's going on? 
МОНИКА: He's retiling my floor. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up! 
МОНИКА: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He started mine first! 
ФИБИ: Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly. 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa! Big octopus. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, what kind of work do you do? 
ФИБИ: Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: You-you work at one of those massage parlors? 
ФИБИ: Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea. 
ФИБИ: All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me? 
НЕДРУГ: You mean like watch? 
ФИБИ: No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't think this, y'know. 
ФИБИ: No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there? 
МОНИКА: It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, like a number? 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! Bye! 
РОСС: Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it's about time. 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, very official. 
РОСС: Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer. 
МОНИКА: And who laminated it? 
РОСС: That would be me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? 
РОСС: Hey, it's my list. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice. 
НЕДРУГ: Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow! 
ФИБИ: Hey!-Hey! What's going on? 
НЕДРУГ: She broke my arm. 
НЕДРУГ: He touched my fanny. 
НЕДРУГ: No, she touched mine first! 
НЕДРУГ: That's my job! 
НЕДРУГ: So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you? 
НЕДРУГ: Ewww!!! 
ФИБИ: You can't have sex with her! 
НЕДРУГ: What'd you think I was, a hooker? 
НЕДРУГ: No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop. 
ФИБИ: Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes. 
НЕДРУГ: Fine. I don't like you! 
ФИБИ: So that's what you thought I did! God! That's not what I do! 
НЕДРУГ: Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do? 
ФИБИ: Nooo! Why would you think that? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know. 
ФИБИ: Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad. 
ФИБИ: You really thought it was perfect? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you? 
НЕДРУГ: Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes... 
ФИБИ: I don't.... 
НЕДРУГ: How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt. 
ФИБИ: Right, okay, um-mm. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I guess I do, yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me. 
ФИБИ: Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know. 
НЕДРУГ: You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry. 
ФИБИ: Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this. 
НЕДРУГ: This? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker... 
ФИБИ: She wasn't a hooker. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, on three. One....Two.... 
ДЖОУИ: Why don't we just go on two. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why two? 
ДЖОУИ: Because it's faster. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, but in the future... 
РОСС: Okay!! Okay!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on! 
РОСС: Heavy thing, not getting lighter! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, one...two... 
ДЖОУИ: So we are going on two? 
НЕДРУГ: All right!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, good job Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, it's big! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe, my ruler's wrong. 
ФИБИ: Maybe all the rulers are wrong. 
ДЖОУИ: Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Um, coffee to go, please. 
РОСС: Isabella Rosselini. 
МОНИКА: Are you serious? Oh my God. 
РОСС: Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list. 
МОНИКА: Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it? 
РОСС: Yeah, maybe. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh, you lie. 
РОСС: What you don't think I'd go up to her? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. 
РОСС: Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate. 
РОСС: Okay, hold my crawler. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Rach, are you really gonna let him do this? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn. 
РОСС: Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one? 
НЕДРУГ: Aren't you with that girl over there? 
РОСС: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. 
РОСС: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, for you. Is that the list? 
РОСС: Um, yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: May I see it? 
РОСС: Um, no. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on! 
РОСС: But, okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not on the list! 
РОСС: Um, see, but that's not the final draft. 
НЕДРУГ: It's laminated! 
РОСС: Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know it's ironic... 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. 
РОСС: We're just gonna be friends. 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know what? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm? 
ДЖОУИ: I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've got five bucks says you can't. 
ДЖОУИ: Get out your checkbook, mister. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I think I have the cash. 
ДЖОУИ: You are dogged man! I totally fit! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go. 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!
