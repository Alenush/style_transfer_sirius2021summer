НЕДРУГ: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
ФИБИ: Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
НЕДРУГ: We will.
МОНИКА: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
МОНИКА: Every year.
ФИБИ: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things.
РОСС: Halftime.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
ФИБИ: Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
ДЖОУИ: Great, you can cover Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
ДЖОУИ: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, all right, I'll play.
ФИБИ: Yay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let's do it! Ross?
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you wanna play football?
РОСС: Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
ДЖОУИ: Says who? Your mom?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no, you say that proudly.
МОНИКА: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
РОСС: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
МОНИКА: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
РОСС: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
МОНИКА: I won the game.
РОСС: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, there was a Geller Cup?
РОСС: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and, threw it in the lake.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And was the curse lifted?
РОСС: Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
МОНИКА: Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
РОСС: Can I see you for a second?
МОНИКА: Once!
РОСС: All right, we're gonna play.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
МОНИКА: Okay. Let's bring it in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
РОСС: Here you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That almost hit me in the face.
ДЖОУИ: All right, we have to pick captains.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then Tineals.
ФИБИ: Okay, so how do we decide that?
МОНИКА: Well, why don't we just bunny up.
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Bunny!
МОНИКА: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, I'm your best friend.
РОСС: Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross!
МОНИКА: Phoebe.
РОСС: Sweetie, now I pick you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
РОСС: Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
МОНИКА: All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Just like in the pros.

РОСС: Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, what am I gonna do?

РОСС: Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need.
МОНИКА: I heard that!
РОСС: Well, I said it loud.
НЕДРУГ: It is okay, if I stay and watch?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that went well.
ДЖОУИ: I think so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
ДЖОУИ: Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Math! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
РОСС: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
РОСС: Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I see that for second.
РОСС: Yeah.
РОСС: Okay. Hut! Hike!
ДЖОУИ: Fumble!
ДЖОУИ: What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
ДЖОУИ: All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
МОНИКА: All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two! Thirty-eight! Hike!

ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, run!
МОНИКА: Run, Phoebe, run!

МОНИКА: After the snap!
РОСС: Before the snap!
ДЖОУИ: After!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Before!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, does it really matter?
НЕДРУГ: Yes!
ФИБИ: Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
РОСС: Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
МОНИКА: Does so count!
РОСС: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
РОСС: Oh-ho, okay.
МОНИКА: Dead leg!
РОСС: Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
ФИБИ: Woo-yay!
МОНИКА: No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
РОСС: Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!
МОНИКА: Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
РОСС: Oh really! Why is that?
МОНИКА: Because the winner gets this!
РОСС: The Geller Cup.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, good.
РОСС: Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
МОНИКА: When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
РОСС: That cup is mine!
МОНИКА: No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
МОНИКА: Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
ДЖОУИ: It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
МОНИКА: All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
ДЖОУИ: What are you gonna do?
МОНИКА: All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Break!
ДЖОУИ: Here you go!
РОСС: Chandler! Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
МОНИКА: Whoa! Whoa! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
РОСС: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
МОНИКА: What?! I just touched him and he went over.
РОСС: Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
ФИБИ: I love this game!
РОСС: Hey, where'd you get that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I went really long.
МОНИКА: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
РОСС: It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
МОНИКА: You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
МОНИКА: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
РОСС: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
МОНИКА: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
РОСС: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can not believe your trading me!
МОНИКА: Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you gonna let me play?
МОНИКА: All right then.
НЕДРУГ: The game is over, we eat now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
РОСС: Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
ДЖОУИ: Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
ДЖОУИ: Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my.
РОСС: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa, no, no, II'm not playing with this guy, now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine with me.
РОСС: Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: Which do I like?
РОСС: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!
НЕДРУГ: I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wh-what?
НЕДРУГ: I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
ДЖОУИ: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
РОСС: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're not gonna lose to girls.
РОСС: Hey! It's 42-21!
ДЖОУИ: This sucks, I was just up by that much!
МОНИКА: Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
МОНИКА: We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
МОНИКА: Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Kill 'um!
ФИБИ: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
МОНИКА: All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points. Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
МОНИКА: Honey, there's a reason.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
ФИБИ: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
МОНИКА: All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! Break!
МОНИКА: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
НЕДРУГ: OneMississippi! TwoMississippi! ThreeMississippi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
МОНИКА: No! I'm not okay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
ДЖОУИ: Thirty seconds left on the timer!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
МОНИКА: Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
ФИБИ: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
МОНИКА: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Break!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got a touchdown! We did it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
ФИБИ: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
РОСС: Let go! Let go!
МОНИКА: Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!
МОНИКА: Ow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
ФИБИ: Isn't there a national football league.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
ФИБИ: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
ДЖОУИ: When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
МОНИКА: Let go!
РОСС: No! You let go!
МОНИКА: No!
РОСС: How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
МОНИКА: I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
РОСС: Hey! It's starting to snow.
РОСС: Gimme the this!
МОНИКА: Let go!
