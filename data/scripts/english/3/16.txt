НЕДРУГ: Previously on Friends.
РОСС: I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?
РОСС: Is this about Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God.
РОСС: Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
РОСС: Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. A break from us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.
РОСС: I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, what do you want to drink?
РОСС: Who’s that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nobody.
РОСС: Is that Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, honey, look he just came over to.
РОСС: Yeah! Got it!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
МОНИКА: How’s the big anniversary dinner?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we never actually got to dinner.
МОНИКА: Ohhh, nice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, we kinda broke up instead.
МОНИКА: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.
МОНИКА: That’s okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
МОНИКА: Oh no!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
МОНИКА: Rachel, you and Mark?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
НЕДРУГ: Morning!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
РОСС: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.
РОСС: Na-huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, I love you.
РОСС: I love you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye.
РОСС: Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
РОСС: Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?
НЕДРУГ: But my apartment is so.
РОСС: Well then a small one! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!
НЕДРУГ: Wait! Where’s my shoes?
РОСС: You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Do I know why we’re rushing?
РОСС: Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!
НЕДРУГ: That’s so great for you guys!
РОСС: Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: You must be so happy!
РОСС: Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.
НЕДРУГ: Good luck, with your girlfriend.
РОСС: Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
РОСС: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
РОСС: Yes, you can, very much.
РОСС: Ahhhh!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
МОНИКА: Oh, there’s banana on it.
ФИБИ: Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
МОНИКА: So then you know?
ФИБИ: The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
МОНИКА: Oh, good. Thanks.
ФИБИ: Now what is Fabutec?
МОНИКА: Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing.
ФИБИ: Waxine!
МОНИКА: Yes! Have you seen it?
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
МОНИКА: I know!
ФИБИ: God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?
МОНИКА: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
ФИБИ: They have the best stuff in there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
РОСС: You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
РОСС: What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
ДЖОУИ: Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.
РОСС: Yeah, but don’t you think.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.
РОСС: Yeah, okay.
ДЖОУИ: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
РОСС: What trail?
ДЖОУИ: The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
РОСС: Oh, II don’t think there’s any trail.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!
ФИБИ: After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
МОНИКА: Did that!
ФИБИ: Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
МОНИКА: Okay. Ow! Ow-oh-oh!
ФИБИ: Was it not pain-free?
МОНИКА: No. It was painful. Oh my God, they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
ФИБИ: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.
МОНИКА: That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.
ФИБИ: Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?
РОСС: Chloe? Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Is this about me taking your watch?
РОСС: You took my watch?
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, I do that.
РОСС: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
НЕДРУГ: Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.
РОСС: Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
РОСС: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met.
НЕДРУГ: You dog!
РОСС: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see II happen to have a girlfriend.
НЕДРУГ: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
РОСС: Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
РОСС: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
НЕДРУГ: Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.
РОСС: Actually, no, we’re not.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we are.
РОСС: No, we’re not.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we are.
РОСС: No, we’re not!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, we’re not.
РОСС: Right.
НЕДРУГ: But, we are.
РОСС: Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.
НЕДРУГ: I can promise not to tell her again.
РОСС: Jasmine?
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh.
РОСС: We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.
НЕДРУГ: You did a bad thing!
РОСС: Yes, I did.
НЕДРУГ: Very bad!
РОСС: Very bad.
НЕДРУГ: Very, very bad.
РОСС: I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
НЕДРУГ: No.
РОСС: Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
НЕДРУГ: All right.
РОСС: Thank you, thank you.
НЕДРУГ: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
РОСС: Who’s your roommate?
РОСС: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?
МОНИКА: Ow!
ФИБИ: Oh!
МОНИКА: Ow! Ow!
ФИБИ: Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
ФИБИ: We’re all right.
МОНИКА: It’s okay, it’s okay.
ФИБИ: We’re all right.
МОНИКА: We were just waxing our legs.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Off?!
ФИБИ: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, II think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, come here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that’s mature.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: That’s right.
РОСС: Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing, nothing.
МОНИКА: Rachel said everything was okay.
ФИБИ: What, what are they talking about?
РОСС: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just get away from me!
РОСС: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
ФИБИ: Whe-where did he put it?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you had sex with another woman!
МОНИКА: Oh my God.
ФИБИ: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk.
МОНИКА: Oh! You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
РОСС: No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just get out! Now!
РОСС: No! No! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! All right! How was she?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-oh.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Was she good?
ДЖОУИ: Don’t answer that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it! How was she?
РОСС: She was.
ДЖОУИ: Awful! Horrible!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was not good. Not good.
ДЖОУИ: She was nothing compared to you.
РОСС: She, she was different.
ДЖОУИ: Ewwwww!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good different?
РОСС: Nobody likes change.
РОСС: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
ФИБИ: Should we do something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
РОСС: I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I waI was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
РОСС: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!
РОСС: Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We were on a break!
РОСС: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
РОСС: Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
ДЖОУИ: Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore.
МОНИКА: What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.
ДЖОУИ: Why not?! I’m hungry.
МОНИКА: Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
РОСС: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we’ll be fine.
РОСС: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, II did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.
ФИБИ: Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.
РОСС: Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
РОСС: Yes I would.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
РОСС: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.
РОСС: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhhh!
РОСС: What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.
РОСС: Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’
ДЖОУИ: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
ФИБИ: We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh great, food with hair on it.
ФИБИ: No, not the used wax.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because that would be crazy?
РОСС: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine. Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.
РОСС: No anchovies.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: With ah, extra anchovies.
РОСС: That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
РОСС: You can have the last piece, if you want.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
ФИБИ: They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.
МОНИКА: What if they don’t?
ДЖОУИ: You think I need a new walk?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you actually saying these words?
РОСС: What, now you’re not even taking to me? Look Rachel, II’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? II don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
МОНИКА: Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
ФИБИ: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
РОСС: Y'know what, y'know what, I’mI’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s.
РОСС: That’s what?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is neither here nor there.
РОСС: Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Ross! Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
РОСС: Okay, okay, okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think you should go.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I really think you need to go now.
РОСС: Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, what the hell did I know!
РОСС: Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.
РОСС: Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then how come it is?
ФИБИ: They’ve been quiet for a long time.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe she killed him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let’s go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that your new walk?
ДЖОУИ: No, I really have to pee.
