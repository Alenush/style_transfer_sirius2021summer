ДЖОУИ: I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
НЕДРУГ: Did not, she did not wink at you.
НЕДРУГ: Huh.
РОСС: I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
НЕДРУГ: Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
НЕДРУГ: See, II think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
НЕДРУГ: What song was that, Pheebs?
НЕДРУГ: Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Monica!
РОСС: Hey Mon!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Mon!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, has she slept at all?
РОСС: Nope.
НЕДРУГ: No, it's been three nights in a row.
РОСС: Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Morning.
ДЖОУИ: Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Good morning.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
НЕДРУГ: I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
НЕДРУГ: III gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
НЕДРУГ: Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
ДЖОУИ: Kiss her! Kiss her!
НЕДРУГ: I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
ДЖОУИ: B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
НЕДРУГ: Nope, not this time.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, quite yankin' me.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not yanking you.
ДЖОУИ: This is Janice.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not breaking up with her!
НЕДРУГ: God, look what I found in the drain.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
РОСС: Getting it away from me would be job one.
НЕДРУГ: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
НЕДРУГ: Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
НЕДРУГ: God, what is wrong with me.
РОСС: You need to get some sleep.
НЕДРУГ: I need to get some Richard.
НЕДРУГ: Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
НЕДРУГ: I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
НЕДРУГ: Maybe, because you told him not to.
НЕДРУГ: What are you the memory woman?
ДЖОУИ: Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
ДЖОУИ: Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
ДЖОУИ: There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
РОСС: Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
НЕДРУГ: Honey, I was wondering.
РОСС: Hmm?
НЕДРУГ: Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
РОСС: Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
НЕДРУГ: Hmm.
РОСС: I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
НЕДРУГ: You remember not having sex in high school, right?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Well honey, what about you?
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
РОСС: No.
НЕДРУГ: Come on you gotta have one!
РОСС: Nope.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, you know what.
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: if you tell me, I might do it.
РОСС: Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
НЕДРУГ: Oooh!
РОСС: Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
НЕДРУГ: Really!
НЕДРУГ: Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
НЕДРУГ: Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
НЕДРУГ: Really! That-that great huh?
НЕДРУГ: No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi you guys!
РОСС: Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
НЕДРУГ: Mon. Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Why aren't you at work?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, they-they sent me home.
НЕДРУГ: Why?
НЕДРУГ: Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
РОСС: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
НЕДРУГ: I know I do.
РОСС: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РОСС: Guess what?
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: They published my paper.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
НЕДРУГ: Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Wheel!
НЕДРУГ: Of!
ДЖОУИ: Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!
НЕДРУГ: You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
ДЖОУИ: I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
НЕДРУГ: No, Janice.
ДЖОУИ: Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
НЕДРУГ: You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
ДЖОУИ: No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair?
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
ДЖОУИ: Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
НЕДРУГ: Well, there you go.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
ДЖОУИ: Look, what do you want me to say?
НЕДРУГ: I want you to say that you like her!
ДЖОУИ: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
РОСС: How could you have told her?
НЕДРУГ: Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
РОСС: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
РОСС: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
РОСС: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
НЕДРУГ: Were both of those Joey?
РОСС: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
НЕДРУГ: Not even with your best friend.
РОСС: Noo!
НЕДРУГ: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
РОСС: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
НЕДРУГ: Pretty much.
РОСС: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
РОСС: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
НЕДРУГ: Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
НЕДРУГ: Richard's living room, drinking wine.
НЕДРУГ: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
НЕДРУГ: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
НЕДРУГ: All right, I'll try not to.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky.
НЕДРУГ: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
НЕДРУГ: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees.
НЕДРУГ: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
НЕДРУГ: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
НЕДРУГ: So, I hear, you hate me!
ДЖОУИ: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
НЕДРУГ: A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
ДЖОУИ: And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there.
НЕДРУГ: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
ДЖОУИ: But what does that gonna do.
НЕДРУГ: For Chandler!
ДЖОУИ: Okay. I'm in.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN! '
ДЖОУИ: Does it have to be a whole day?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
НЕДРУГ: So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
НЕДРУГ: Monica, do you want us to take you home?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
РОСС: Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
НЕДРУГ: Umm, yeah.
РОСС: No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.
НЕДРУГ: Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
РОСС: Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
НЕДРУГ: We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
РОСС: Nooo!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, okay.
РОСС: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! All right! You go first.
РОСС: Okay, okay, I'll go first.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing.
НЕДРУГ: Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
РОСС: Yes!
НЕДРУГ: I know!
РОСС: Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
РОСС: Hmph.
НЕДРУГ: And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.
РОСС: With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
НЕДРУГ: I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know. You don't know!
РОСС: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
НЕДРУГ: You said.
РОСС: I said ' share ' not ' scare '. Go sit over there!
НЕДРУГ: We're baack!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: What are you guys doing together?
НЕДРУГ: Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!
НЕДРУГ: Really.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
НЕДРУГ: I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
НЕДРУГ: You still can't stand her can you?
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
ДЖОУИ: But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess that's something.
ДЖОУИ: No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Oh God!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
НЕДРУГ: April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, SixtyOne, 4:30 A. M. on Tuesday, the United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon it is now under bombardment by.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
НЕДРУГ: I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
НЕДРУГ: What makes you think that I might not be okay?
НЕДРУГ: I saw Richard.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: So, how are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
НЕДРУГ: You don't wanna know.
НЕДРУГ: No, I really, really do.
НЕДРУГ: Well, he's doing terrible!
НЕДРУГ: Really!
НЕДРУГ: Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
НЕДРУГ: You're not just saying that are you?
НЕДРУГ: No, the man is a mess.
НЕДРУГ: Was he crying?
НЕДРУГ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
НЕДРУГ: Maybe.
НЕДРУГ: I think so.
НЕДРУГ: Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
НЕДРУГ: Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
РОСС: No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's.
НЕДРУГ: Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
РОСС: I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
