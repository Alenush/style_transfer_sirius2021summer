МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Six dollars, please. 
МОНИКА: Six? I just had it for one night. It's three. 
НЕДРУГ: Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02. 
МОНИКА: Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three. 
НЕДРУГ: I can help with that. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God. Richard? Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks. 
НЕДРУГ: So, you look great. 
МОНИКА: Right. 
НЕДРУГ: No you do. You... just... 
МОНИКА: What? 
НЕДРУГ: You've got panties stuck to your leg. 
МОНИКА: That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity. 
НЕДРУГ: It's good to see you. 
МОНИКА: It's good to see you too. 
МОНИКА: You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn. 
НЕДРУГ: He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: I missed this. 
МОНИКА: Me too. 
НЕДРУГ: So, you wanna get a hamburger or something? 
МОНИКА: Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise. 
МОНИКА: No, I just I think that it's too soon. 
НЕДРУГ: No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, baby! 
РОСС: What are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Making chocolate milk. Do you want some? 
РОСС: No thanks. I'm 29. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I gotta go to work! 
РОСС: Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late. 
РОСС: Oh come on, not again. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay? 
РОСС: Hmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work... 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past. 
РОСС: Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Look at you. Since when do you roller blade? 
ФИБИ: Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff. 
РОСС: And what are you going to do for him? 
ФИБИ: I'm going to let him. 
РОСС: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Cool. 
МОНИКА: Morning. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Somebody got in late last night. 
МОНИКА: Yeah well, I ran into Richard. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When did this happen? 
МОНИКА: Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger. 
ФИБИ: Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger. 
РОСС: So, are you gonna see him again? 
МОНИКА: Tomorrow night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him. 
МОНИКА: It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex. 
МОНИКА: We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends. 
РОСС: Naked friends. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you have any ice? 
ДЖОУИ: Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day? 
ДЖОУИ: I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How often do you read it? 
ДЖОУИ: Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining? 
ДЖОУИ: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, you got it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little? 
ФИБИ: Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
РОСС: Hey. 
ФИБИ: You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed. 
РОСС: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm from California. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything? 
ФИБИ: I'll have coffee. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, me too. 
РОСС: Yeah, make that three. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay Ross, why don't you come with me? 
РОСС: Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Robert's coming out. 
РОСС: What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts. 
РОСС: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The man is showing brain. 
РОСС: Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a.... 
НЕДРУГ: Coffee. 
РОСС: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: We could write it down for you? 
РОСС: No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wellll? 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do we do? What do we do? 
РОСС: Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like an eclipse. 
НЕДРУГ: So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say? 
МОНИКА: You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes. 
НЕДРУГ: Ew, this feels very weird. 
МОНИКА: You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand. 
МОНИКА: Oops. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Gotta keep squishing. 
НЕДРУГ: Tomatoes are squishing. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Op. 
МОНИКА: Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be..... 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
МОНИКА: Umm, you've got some on your pants. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll just throw them out. 
ДЖОУИ: These little women. Wow! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your liking it, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her. 
РОСС: Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine. 
ДЖОУИ: But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, actually Laurie's a boy. 
ДЖОУИ: No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go? 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean a three pointer? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I get more because I'm dainty. 
НЕДРУГ: So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock. 
ДЖОУИ: What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah, good to meet you. Robert. 
ФИБИ: What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?! 
РОСС: Calm down. There's no reason to get testy. 
ФИБИ: You guys!! Come on! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped. 
ФИБИ: What do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
МОНИКА: So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure. 
НЕДРУГ: You really sure? 
МОНИКА: I'll call you back. 
МОНИКА: So we can be friends who sleep together. 
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball. 
МОНИКА: Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies? 
НЕДРУГ: Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday. 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: You want me to cancel it? 
МОНИКА: No! No! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: 'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends. 
НЕДРУГ: Exactly. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down! 
НЕДРУГ: You ready to go to the batting cage? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. And, first here's a gift. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Wow! Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day! 
НЕДРУГ: Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry. 
ФИБИ: That's all right, that's well, I figured.... 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! How's it going? 
РОСС: Good. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Danny just went into room 217. 
ДЖОУИ: Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it! 
ДЖОУИ: All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hmmm, that's very cool. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! I can't believe you just did that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe she cracked your code! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eh. Beth dies. 
ДЖОУИ: Beth, Beth dies? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um-hmm. 
ДЖОУИ: Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. She doesn't die. 
ДЖОУИ: Then why would you say that?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because, I wanted to hurt you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my.... 
НЕДРУГ: Got 'em. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry. I'm sorry. 
МОНИКА: You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire. 
МОНИКА: What are you smiling at? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, right. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello. 
МОНИКА: I love this friend thing! 
ФИБИ: Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him? 
РОСС: Oh. 
ФИБИ: Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?' 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. 
РОСС: He's right, even if it's to say something complementary. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other. 
ФИБИ: No, I can spot you from here. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ФИБИ: Okay, listen Robert... 
РОСС: Hey, don't we have to... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we got, um-hmm. 
ФИБИ: Umm, I think you're really, really great... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts? 
ФИБИ: I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house. 
МОНИКА: Ow! 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Ah well, this is the living room. 
НЕДРУГ: Impressive. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. This is the kitchen. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom? 
НЕДРУГ: The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom. 
НЕДРУГ: We're still on this side of the door. 
НЕДРУГ: Um-hmm. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but I didn't get to see it. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening. 
МОНИКА: So um, who was she? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today. 
МОНИКА: Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you seem fine. 
МОНИКА: Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people? 
НЕДРУГ: You mean like exclusive friends? 
МОНИКА: Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed. 
МОНИКА: That's not true, you don't have a moustache. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again. 
НЕДРУГ: I know I couldn't. So.... 
МОНИКА: How 'bout one last game of racquetball? 
МОНИКА: Watch the thorns! 
НЕДРУГ: Ow!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Beth is really, really sick. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awwww. 
ДЖОУИ: Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you want to put the book in the freezer? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
