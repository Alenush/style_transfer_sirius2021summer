ДЖОУИ: WHOAA!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed. 
МОНИКА: Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. 
РОСС: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning? 
МОНИКА: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn't know there were docks. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: Aww, is it broken? 
ДЖОУИ: No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed? 
ДЖОУИ: Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket. 
ДЖОУИ: What is this? Fruit? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica's making jam. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because the kids need new shoes. 
МОНИКА: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. 
ДЖОУИ: This will just be my batch. 
ФИБИ: Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you. 
НЕДРУГ: You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters.... 
ФИБИ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: One more chance Ursula, please? 
ФИБИ: Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. 
НЕДРУГ: Wh.. 
ФИБИ: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus! 
ФИБИ: Oh, you're not a dingus. 
НЕДРУГ: I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones. 
ФИБИ: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Well thanks. 
ФИБИ: Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying? 
НЕДРУГ: Not really. 
ФИБИ: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here 
ФИБИ: Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, okay. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon? 
РОСС: Mon? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.' 
РОСС: Wait a minute, look. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: Look, look, look. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what, what? 
РОСС: It's an empty apartment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oooh. 
РОСС: We're all alone in an empty apartment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. 
РОСС: There it is. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey. 
РОСС: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do I look fat? 
НЕДРУГ: Noo. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her.... 
РОСС: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo! 
РОСС: And it works both ways. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so you both just know this stuff? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on. 
РОСС: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's easy, baggage claim. 
РОСС: Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work. 
РОСС: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right are you guys gonna come down? 
РОСС: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good luck Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you Rachel. 
РОСС: Bye sweetie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye hon. 
РОСС: Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers. 
РОСС: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
РОСС: I'm gonna use the cushion. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
РОСС: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, the old hug and roll. 
РОСС: Yep. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, one question. 
РОСС: Shoot. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right? 
ДЖОУИ: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're so pretty. 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today. 
ДЖОУИ: You talked to him. Are you crazy? 
ФИБИ: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom. 
ФИБИ: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute. 
РОСС: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker. 
ФИБИ: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean 
ФИБИ: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather. 
МОНИКА: Hey guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Mon. 
МОНИКА: Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin. 
ДЖОУИ: Aww. Ohh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. 
ДЖОУИ: Put your hands together. 
МОНИКА: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch. 
ДЖОУИ: No more jam?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what happened to your jam plan? 
МОНИКА: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars. 
РОСС: What are you talking about? 
МОНИКА: I'm talking about me having a baby. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you serious? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan. 
РОСС: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad! 
МОНИКА: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That, that's what's stupid. 
МОНИКА: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Down at the docks again? 
НЕДРУГ: Night-night Bing-a-ling. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' 
НЕДРУГ: Here's my binoculars. 
ФИБИ: Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going. 
НЕДРУГ: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun. 
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah. What's this? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it? 
ФИБИ: Um, not even a little bit. 
НЕДРУГ: It's about you. 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay then. 
НЕДРУГ: I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool. 
ФИБИ: Good. So what were you thinking? 
НЕДРУГ: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you. 
ФИБИ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you. 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard. 
МОНИКА: Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean there's more than one of us. 
РОСС: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna..... 
МОНИКА: You're gonna what? 
РОСС: I'm gonna tell Mom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy. 
РОСС: Crazy. 
МОНИКА: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something.... 
РОСС: Oh, it's not the ideal way... 
МОНИКА: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know? 
ДЖОУИ: Check it out!! Jam crackers! 
МОНИКА: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!' 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, the Knicks rule! 
МОНИКА: Joey, this is you! 
ДЖОУИ: Let me see. Oh, right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When did you go to a sperm bank? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that's how you bought it? 
ДЖОУИ: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left. 
МОНИКА: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little. 
ФИБИ: Hellooo! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РОСС: How's the maniac? 
ФИБИ: Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, what are you doing? 
ФИБИ: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that. 
ФИБИ: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. 
РОСС: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles? 
ФИБИ: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order. 
ФИБИ: What are you saying I should do? 
МОНИКА: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him. 
ФИБИ: Thank you, Monica. 
ДЖОУИ: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes. 
МОНИКА: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, what happened? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross's what? 
НЕДРУГ: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: Yes? Yes! Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Were you following me? 
ФИБИ: Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister. 
НЕДРУГ: So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. 
ФИБИ: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic. 
ФИБИ: No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh, I don't know. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?

МОНИКА: Really, is he a swimmer?

МОНИКА: I like that. What? 
ДЖОУИ: You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know. 
МОНИКА: We do not have one of those signs.

МОНИКА: Two girls and a boy? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!

МОНИКА: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. . 
ДЖОУИ: I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person.
