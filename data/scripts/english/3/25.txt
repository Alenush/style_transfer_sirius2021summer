ЧЕНДЛЕР: So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
НЕДРУГ: All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell it again. Seriously.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
МОНИКА: Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
ДЖОУИ: Well, I think we all learned something.
ФИБИ: Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
ФИБИ: Y'know what that means?
ДЖОУИ: That you're actually 50?
ФИБИ: No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B. F. F. Best Friends Forever.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is so cool.
ФИБИ: I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Yeah, we can!
НЕДРУГ: Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
РОСС: That's too bad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
ФИБИ: So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
МОНИКА: Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
МОНИКА: Thanks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
МОНИКА: Yeah right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why is that so funny?
МОНИКА: You made a joke right? So I laughed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
МОНИКА: Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
МОНИКА: Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
ДЖОУИ: No, it's just my luggage.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
