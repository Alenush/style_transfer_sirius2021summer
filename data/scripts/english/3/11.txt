ДЖОУИ: Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it? 
МОНИКА: Um-mm. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts. 
РОСС: Real magic does exist. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. 
МОНИКА: Wow. Joey, how do you do it? 
ДЖОУИ: I can't tell you that, no. 
РОСС: Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor. 
МОНИКА: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything. 
ФИБИ: Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?' 
МОНИКА: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down. 
МОНИКА: All right, be my guest. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good luck. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I got it. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... . 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, you are very beautiful. 
ФИБИ: Oh, thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end? 
МОНИКА: Honey, what's the matter? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just saw Janice. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them. 
ДЖОУИ: Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon. 
ДЖОУИ: Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know.... 
РОСС: Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me. 
МОНИКА: It's Joey's birthday. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him. 
МОНИКА: Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh. 
НЕДРУГ: How's that coffee comin,' dear? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! 
НЕДРУГ: I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op. 
НЕДРУГ: Eh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you got me. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that sounds great. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on over here, sweetheart. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much. 
НЕДРУГ: I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it. 
МОНИКА: I know honey, I'm sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in. 
МОНИКА: Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Is my misery amusing to you? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not funny, this is actually my job. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah, just one other thing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes?! 
НЕДРУГ: I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you want my pickle? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys. 
МОНИКА: Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs? 
ФИБИ: Well, he's very charming. 
МОНИКА: I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him. 
ФИБИ: Well, you're just gonna have to try. 
МОНИКА: Joey, where are the Jello shots? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around... 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello-dillillio!! 
РОСС: Oh, somebody's feeling better. 
МОНИКА: Stick out your tongue. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Take off your shirt! 
МОНИКА: Oh my!! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Jello just like Mom used to make. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The most unbelievable thing happened to me today. 
РОСС: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview! 
РОСС: Wow! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! 
РОСС: What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh! 
РОСС: And he's, he's a total stranger? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! His name is um, Mark something. 
РОСС: Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What!? 
РОСС: Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: To be nice. 
РОСС: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason? 
ДЖОУИ: No, only for sex. 
РОСС: Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell. 
РОСС: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey!! Hey-hey-hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing? 
МОНИКА: How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi Joey's sisters! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. What are we drinkin' over here. 
ФИБИ: Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice. 
НЕДРУГ: No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband. 
ФИБИ: Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you. 
НЕДРУГ: What 'cha doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have. 
РОСС: Hi. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
РОСС: Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today. 
МОНИКА: Isn't that great? 
РОСС: Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy. 
МОНИКА: Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.' 
РОСС: That's excellent. 
РОСС: So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job. 
МОНИКА: How ya feelin'? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it. 
ФИБИ: Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. 
НЕДРУГ: Woooo hoooo!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.' 
ФИБИ: Why, what happened? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part. 
МОНИКА: What is the worse part? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't remember which sister. 
РОСС: You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!! 
МОНИКА: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! You don't think I thought of that? 
ФИБИ: How can you not know which one? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean that's unbelievable. 
МОНИКА: I mean, was it Gina? 
РОСС: Which one is Gina? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. 
МОНИКА: No, no, no, that's Dina. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!! 
ФИБИ: We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat. 
МОНИКА: That was me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry. 
МОНИКА: That's okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's all right. 
РОСС: That's okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Can I talk to you for a second?! 
РОСС: Hey, Joey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses. 
ДЖОУИ: I just got off the phone with my sister. 
РОСС: Ah, which, which one? 
ДЖОУИ: Mary-Angela. 
РОСС: Mary-Angela. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Y'know which one was she again? 
ДЖОУИ: Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's gotta be the first one. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep, I'm in a tree. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did he call? Did Mark call? 
МОНИКА: No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe? 
МОНИКА: I guess they're back from their date. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Music. Very nice. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, how are you? 
МОНИКА: I am good. I finished my book. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, what's it about? 
МОНИКА: I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I do. 
РОСС: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba. 
РОСС: All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? 
РОСС: Where in Cuba? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here? 
ДЖОУИ: Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm here to see Mary-Angela. 
ДЖОУИ: You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Mary-Angela? 
ДЖОУИ: She's right in there. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Chandler! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call. 
РОСС: Bummer. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy. 
РОСС: No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you. 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen. 
РОСС: But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy. 
МОНИКА: Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number. 
РОСС: What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me. 
РОСС: That's right good things, that-that is what I said. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. 
РОСС: That is so made up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview! 
МОНИКА: Yay! 
РОСС: There you go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it. 
МОНИКА: Oh, that is amazing! 
РОСС: Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got to figure out what I'm going to wear. 
РОСС: High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo! 
РОСС: You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way? 
МОНИКА: What? 
РОСС: 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend! 
МОНИКА: Are you crazy?! 
РОСС: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal. 
МОНИКА: What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too? 
РОСС: No. 
МОНИКА: I mean don't you trust her? 
РОСС: Well, yeah! 
МОНИКА: Then get over yourself! Grow up! 
РОСС: You grow up. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela? 
НЕДРУГ: No! I did! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it? 
НЕДРУГ: Of course! It's her favorite. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite? 
НЕДРУГ: More of Grandma's teramisu. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you just please....give me the recipe 'cause this is great. It's top notch. 
НЕДРУГ: That dies with me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So will I. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything. 
НЕДРУГ: Just do it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will you excuse me I have to um..... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place. 
НЕДРУГ: So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm Mary-Theresa. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is? 
НЕДРУГ: I am! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, this is soo bad. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: What's goin' on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're it! Now run and hide! 
НЕДРУГ: It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar. 
НЕДРУГ: I say, punch him Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Punch him!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again. 
НЕДРУГ: So what. I say, punch him. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Punch him! Punch him! 
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll do it. 
ДЖОУИ: No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, absolutely! 
ДЖОУИ: All right. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You've got it. 
ДЖОУИ: Cookie, now you can punch him! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you doing here? 
РОСС: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
РОСС: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
РОСС: How'd did it go? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up. 
РОСС: I'm so proud of you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me too! 
РОСС: Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Hi Mark! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I did! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!! 
РОСС: Congradu!! -lations-lations. 
МОНИКА: So ah, Phoebe, how was your date? 
ФИБИ: Oh well y'know. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I do know. 
ФИБИ: Ick, you were eavesdropping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me. 
РОСС: Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it? 
РОСС: Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too? 
ДЖОУИ: All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy? 
РОСС: Ah, we'll all go. Come on. 
ФИБИ: Thanks you guys! Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't worry. 
ФИБИ: God, I hope they kick his ass! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, I'm sorry. 
МОНИКА: Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. 
НЕДРУГ: May I help you?
