НЕДРУГ: 'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! This girl is good.
ФИБИ: Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I like her.
ФИБИ: Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
МОНИКА: Look at you. All jealous.
РОСС: Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more, y'know, and you're more.
НЕДРУГ: beside meeeee-eeee-ee.
ФИБИ: Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, my next song's called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
ФИБИ: Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
НЕДРУГ: I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
ДЖОУИ: So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
ФИБИ: Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, anything we might of heard of?
НЕДРУГ: Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away.
НЕДРУГ: Home is Home Star stew.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
ФИБИ: Hmm, bummer.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
ФИБИ: No. But thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
ФИБИ: Okay. No. But thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, that was kinda brutal.
ФИБИ: Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?
МОНИКА: Yeah, sure.
НЕДРУГ: Someone in there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jeez, man did you fall. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
НЕДРУГ: Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'mI'm talking to ah, This is the part where you say your name.
НЕДРУГ: Ginger.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so.
НЕДРУГ: Don't you have to use the bathroom?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
НЕДРУГ: Someone in here.
ФИБИ: Where's Chandler?
ДЖОУИ: Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his. Whoa-oh!
НЕДРУГ: Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
НЕДРУГ: Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
ДЖОУИ: Phew, close one.
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, sweetie!
РОСС: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Ross.
РОСС: Yeah, huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I've got some bad news.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
РОСС: Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
НЕДРУГ: Actually, it's kinda my fault. II quit today.
РОСС: But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
РОСС: Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, then.
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well we're gonna miss you around here.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, me too.
НЕДРУГ: So, see ya on Saturday.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you bet.
ФИБИ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
ФИБИ: Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
МОНИКА: Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
ФИБИ: Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
МОНИКА: Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
ФИБИ: You never run on a barge!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Is ah, is Chandler around?
МОНИКА: No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
ДЖОУИ: Oooh.
МОНИКА: Yeah, Ginger something.
ДЖОУИ: Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
МОНИКА: No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'
ДЖОУИ: Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
МОНИКА: Well, what did you do?
ДЖОУИ: What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
МОНИКА: Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.
ДЖОУИ: All right! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner.
МОНИКА: You gave her food poisoning!?
ДЖОУИ: I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! You threw Pepper on the fire!
ДЖОУИ: I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
ДЖОУИ: I ran!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
НЕДРУГ: Oh damn, I hate that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, don't worry about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, really you're gonna freeze.
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
НЕДРУГ: Some day, maybe.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Funny book?
РОСС: Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
РОСС: Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
РОСС: Oh, well.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Ross!
РОСС: Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because, he's my friend.
РОСС: Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
РОСС: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
РОСС: Pa-haa! I would love to go with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really!?
РОСС: Yeah, hey II have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion, monger.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
РОСС: What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
МОНИКА: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
ФИБИ: It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
МОНИКА: Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
ФИБИ: You think you know me so well.
МОНИКА: Well, don't 'cha wanna?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Okay, well I do know you.
ФИБИ: That's what I said.
МОНИКА: Well so?
ФИБИ: I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
НЕДРУГ: My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I.
ФИБИ: I stepped in something icky.
НЕДРУГ: Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll, avoid the, pillleeeee.
НЕДРУГ: We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink.
РОСС: I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ФИБИ: Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
НЕДРУГ: Wow, that's great.
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
ФИБИ: I, a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
НЕДРУГ: What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
ФИБИ: Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
НЕДРУГ: Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
ФИБИ: That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
НЕДРУГ: oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
МОНИКА: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
МОНИКА: So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
МОНИКА: Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey told you about the leg, huh?
МОНИКА: Uh-huh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
ДЖОУИ: Morning.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
ДЖОУИ: Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It came up.
ДЖОУИ: Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
РОСС: So I nodded off a little.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nodded off! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
РОСС: Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
РОСС: First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
РОСС: Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that is so.
РОСС: No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
РОСС: No. I. I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. III know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, III like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
РОСС: That's a little clearer.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
РОСС: Sure, III.
НЕДРУГ: Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
НЕДРУГ: It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: 'How much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No. I don't think so.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
НЕДРУГ: What's that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's-that's my nubbin.
НЕДРУГ: What's a nubbin?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
НЕДРУГ: You have three nipples?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as. Ahh, what?
НЕДРУГ: Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
НЕДРУГ: Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay.
ФИБИ: Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
НЕДРУГ: Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay.
ФИБИ: Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay.
НЕДРУГ: I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
ФИБИ: No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, I don't want to forget it.
ФИБИ: Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
НЕДРУГ: Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
МОНИКА: Sorry, Pheebs.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. You okay?
ФИБИ: Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: We'd love too.
ФИБИ: Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well hello!
ДЖОУИ: Where have you been?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The doctor.
РОСС: Is everything okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
МОНИКА: Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
МОНИКА: Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
