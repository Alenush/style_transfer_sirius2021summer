C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him! Instead of? Never had that dream. This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself. And you never knew she was a lesbian. Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! I say push her down the stairs. And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot. What, like there's a rule or something? Who's Paul? Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy? Hey Pheebs, you wanna help? What's this? Done with the bookcase! Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get? You got screwed. What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something. Although actually I'm really not that hungry. Morning, Paul. That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date? Yeah, I'm an actor. I doubt it. Mostly regional work. I will not take this abuse. Of course it was a line! I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! I can't believe what I'm hearing here. Yeah, right! Y'serious? Are we still talking about sex? Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. Alright, when'd'ya have it on last? Well, this is still ruined, right? Your folks are really that bad, huh? What are we supposed to be seeing here? Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. Yeah. Cushions the blow. Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. Thanks! Let's keep going. I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke. What? Whoah! Hey! No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. Y'miss it? That's ridiculous! Y'okay, Phoebe? What are you talking about? Keep it! So when do we get to meet the guy? Let it go, Ross. You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! Chandler! He's here! Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. Alan. Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? Oh, you do, do you? Do you have any respect for your body? What's going on? Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear. Oh, God! So that's it? It's over? Just like that? Okay! Probably kill myself! Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! You are? Ross, I'm sorry. Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, RangersPenguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you. We love you, man. So? What's wrong with the twentieth? The hell with hockey, let's all do that! C'mon, Ross! Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. Leech spots Messier in the crease there's the pass! What? Peaches? Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. Well, how long do you think it'll be? He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. What? With Carol? Oh. Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? Really? Oh, ah the kid has it. Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me. No plans, huh? Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. My god, Angela. No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela. You look good. You don't say. Bob? Who the hell's Bob? Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too. What? Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends? You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica. Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you. Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's, brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is. What? Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me. I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please? Yep. Which what? No, but he's. Oh my god. I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not. So, you and Angela, huh? You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel. Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it. Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually. What? Come on, they're close. Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross. Well, who's to say what's true? I mean. All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little. Ow! Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you. Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up. Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here. Excellent. Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. Whadja think? C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head. The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me! Who's Rick? I couldn't do it. When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. Uh huh, uh huh, oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie! Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!' 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!' I'm his. I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt. C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer. Whaddya think? Today's the big day! Thank you! Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. Me? Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost. Well, I'm I'm showering. Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing. I think his butt would be angry here. I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask. Nope. I got fired. Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and. My mom will. Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Hard to tell, I was naked. Yeah? That's so nice! Hi everyone. Well, Chandler s old room mate was Jewish and these are the only candles we have so, Happy Hanukkah everyone! What s up man?

Wait, wait, wait! So I guess you all saw it. Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. Chandler, will you just come in already? Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots. But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease. The balloon? Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. That tone will not make me go any faster. That one will. Nope, not that one. Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math. Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice. You call that delicious? I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy! Oh, I will. The bigger half. Ahhh, I didn't get the job. I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know? Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. Nice shoes, huh? You know more than one Fun Bobby? Ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! Uh, four. Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! You brought your kids. Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt, but not a mom, never a mom! Yeah, well, you don't have your racket. Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size. Ross, how could you let this happen? You don't think my mom's sexy? I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? He forgot to leave his grip size! So are you gonna tell him? How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. Uhhhh, he's not even wearing a jockstrap! Uh, y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened. Me neither, y'know what. What are you mad at me for?! Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code? Ah! Huh? Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout. C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all. MotherKisser. I'll shut up. Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. No, no. He said 'When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?' Then she came back with 'The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?' That makes more sense. I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away, they're walking away. No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run! You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'. Ross, did you really read all these baby books? Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy! I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands. Need a new table. That's the rule. How'd you get to that? You knew about that? Ok, ok, How about if we split it? Yeah. Why not? Why, are you moving out? You'd tell me if you were moving out right. Aw, I know all about Kip! Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? So what's it gonna be? Or an uncle. Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. Whoa, whoa, store will be open tomorrow! Feminist issue. That's where I went! Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? So what, like people are gonna come in and think, Uh-oh, I'm outside again? Of course! I don't know, birds just don't say, Hello, sit here, eat something. All right, how about the ladybugs? Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team. Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the antiPaolo! Wha. Hey! Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning! Oh yeah! Hey you guys! You all know my dad? Dad! Er. Uuuuhhh! Let me say Hi. Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazeta, and, excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma? Sure! So how long you been. Since then? I don't know. Hah! You're one to talk! Oh man. Please tell me one of them is Ma! It's, like, if you wake up one day, and found out your dad was leading this, double life. He's, like, actually some spy, working for the CIA. That'd be cool. This blows! What's the matter with Rog? Goodnight, you guys. Hey? Can, er, can we help you? I, I'm Joey Tribiani. Hey Dad. Huh. Ronnie's here! Woah ho! No you won't. If you go to a hotel, you'll be doin' stuff. I want you right here, where I can keep an eye on you. That's right mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof, you're gonna live by my rules. And that means, no sleeping with your girlfriend. Now Dad, you'll be in my room, Ronnie, er, you can stay in Chandler's room. OK. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you've gotta make a change. Six years is long enough. Well, either you break it off with Ronnie. Then you've gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right! I don't wanna hear it! Now, go to my room! I'm just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. I've been thinking. You know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls. You know what I mean. About how I'm always going out with all these women, and I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand up guy, and go the distance, you know. I'm looking at my Dad, thinking. No. You really think so? Aw! Thanks Chandler. Hey! What's the matter with you? Ma! What are you doin' here? Ow! Big ring! Hold on. You knew? So then, wha, how could you, I mean, how could you. Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but what the hell are you talking about? I, I mean, what about you? I'm happy for you? Ma. I'm sorry. I, I just did what I thought you'd want. Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is. With this ring? No contest! Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my Ma, like she wanted. My Ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know, even though she does, and my little sister Tina, can't see her husband any more, cos he got a restraining order, which has nothing to do with anything, except that I found out today. Yeah, I guess, it's just, you know, they're parents, after a certain point you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes. Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop, Rachel Green. Sorry. Wrong boobies. I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you. You're in! Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks. Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg. Think it'll work? Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', ch-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. How do I look? No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. Chandler: Calm down, calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months! Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous. Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? We can't do that. Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? Uh, we might be leaving now. She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it. You're right, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler. Whoa. I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's. If you don't do it, I will. So what're you going to do? How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free. So, back to your place you thinking, maybe, huh-huh? I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. Mmmm. Good. It's creamier. I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? Uh-oh. Vulva? Whoaa! You cuddled? How many times? What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. yeah, what else? Alright, look, I'll start, OK? Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh. Ross, you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. Alright, now you say something. Come on! You like this woman, right? You want to see her again, right? Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt! Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead. There you go! Keep going. Keep going! Say it, say it! Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again. And again, and again, and again. Hello? And again. What a tool! So, er, how did it go with Celia? All right, Ross! Whoa! And the, huh-huh? You cuddled. Yeah, where the hell is he? There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss? No, no how come are you working here? I'm sayin' I see a difference. I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's-hot! Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today. Nope. Nope. Not from where I was standin'. I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries. She is so hot. Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister? So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there. Cool, thanks. Hey. Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits. Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise. Yep. Ice Capades. I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that. Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok. Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok. Out. Yes. Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right? Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. He should take the sack? Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. When's that? Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys? Hey. Your sister stood me up the other night. I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off. Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you. No, no, no, don't say listen. I know that listen. I've said that listen. I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge? You don't drink. Urs. Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe? No. No, I, I couldn't do that. Then, uh, then I'm sorry. I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful. Pheebs? We just got the message. Hola, amigos. Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few. Shut up! Thank you. There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz. About what? Heh. I was bluffing. You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright? Yeah? No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her. Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand. But hey, thanks for teachin' us CrossEyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game. What? Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. That's fine. I'll just have a TicTac to hold me over. Uh. Phoebe? Phoebe? Me too. Alright, whattaya got. Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out. Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this. Check. That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What? Here, I got five, I got five.  Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat. Oh! The Unbearable Likeness of Being! Suckfest! Hey. I don't need violence to enjoy a movie, just so long as there's a little nudity. I meant female nudity! Alright, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking! I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief. She really said that? Tonight, tonight? How could you loose him? Alright, alright, alright, you're a monkey, you're loose in the city. Where do you go? Marcel? Marcel? A monkey. Sure, sure. Did you, er, did you try turning the knob back the other way? Ah, then, no. Er, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here? We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out! Marcel! I don't know. I loved high school. You know, it was just, like, four years of parties, and dating, and sex. No way! Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, Her answer machine? Duh, where've you been? Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, Yeah, toast, oatmeal, nothing that spatters. Maybe she never got your message. He's back! The peeper's back! Get down! Yeah? Naughty! Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she. Oh my. Hey, you know our phone's not working?

All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. How could someone get a hold of your credit card number? No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not. Stalin. Stalin do I know that name? It sounds familiar. Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! Where've you been? Hey! He beat ya. I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks! Isn't there any way you can keep him? How do you get a monkey into a zoo? Did you call the cops? You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be? We, we come back from our walk and the the phone was ringing. I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. Marcel, I'm hungry. Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio. Holden McGroin. Exellent dream score. I don't know. What are you wearing? Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? How young is young Ethan? Young? Whoa! Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean. All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. Services? Oh, services. Hey, hey. How was the first day? Oh. Yeah, you do. My scones. All right. So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler? What? Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is? Stegosaurus! What about Andr'? They're here allready? Uh, moist, yeah. All right, all right. For the ride. All right, I'm going. I'm going. Do we have to know about that? I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars. Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen, lady. whoa. Oh yeah? And who do you like? The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if wait. They suck, all right? Wha? Wha.aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father! Oh, oh, oh, sorry. Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here. HI, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello? Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know? Ok, look, maybe I should just go. Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team. Oh, it is. It is. Ew! What is that? Something exploded! Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's- I was just-yeah, right. Push! Push! Oh, just had a baby. Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name. He doesn't do much, does he? Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. I will, really. I'll pay you back this time. Well. I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some, research. Oh, just, y'know, science. It's a fertility study. Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really. I mean, I just go down there every other day and, make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. We make fire. Cook meat. Oh, OK. I don't know, she's, uh, she's pretty great. What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any, ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean. Hey! The country? Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but. I love you, man. Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna, complete the transaction, if you know what I. Then you do. Heh, heh. What do you mean? Not following you.  That book got me through some tough times. That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. The country. He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. Heh, heh. It was nothin'. Uhhh, y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh, let's give you another turn. Sure! Why not? How do you mean? Shhhh! She's still asleep. Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got, man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! It was amazing! And not just for her, uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like. I was able to appreciate it on another level. I know! Neither did I! Seven hundred bucks! Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? Um, this? Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie. Needs some clothes altered? Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990? You know, I think I was sixteen. No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again. Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe? Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means. Can we see her? How're you doing? Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts. You gotta tell Ross how you feel. What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. Frankie? What're you talking about? No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years. That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? What? That's not? Oh my god. Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test. I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants. I gotta get one, too. Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. Uh, does it hurt? Chandler? Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle. Who? What's he doin' in my section? Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'? Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory. Yeah. Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee. Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? What is the big deal? Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh. Exactly. Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Yeah I guess you're right. I'm gonna do it. Mornin'. I said, mornin'. Yeah, I'm ready. These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts. You guys are messin' with me, right? That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa. Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster! Such as? Check this out. Can I have this? Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too. Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook. Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school. That's what it says. What? So, you were both dorks. Big deal. Have you been here all night? Chandler, Heckles was a nut case. All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go. Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody. I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out. Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place? You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right? Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably. Geez, look how fat she got. Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you? You want his yearbook? Oh, yeah. This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married? I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it. What happens if you flick it? Foxy lady. The Ice Capades? I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do, so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray. Thank you. Wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. Me too, we should get goin'. I got time. Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? Do we need a cake? All right. Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies. Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying let's go here, let's go there. Like we can afford to go here and there. For Ross. Hi. If it's not you, this is a horrible story. Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney? Cool. Sorry, sorry. What are these, like famous chickens? Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper? Thank you. Yeah. Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you. 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. Yeah. Thanks. Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like. Charity. Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel. Me too. Fine. Come on you guys, one more time. Nooo. Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid. You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish? And we don't work hard? And you feel like we hold you back. Let me get that. You got five bucks? Cool. Goo, goo, goo, waaah! Are you ok, Ross? Is he gonna be ok? What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we? Hat, milk, got it. Consider it done. Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue. It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby. No, seriously. You wanna smell him? Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Hey, hey, look at that talent. Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff. Yeah. Get outta here. This is our stop too. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk. Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink? Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again. I'm him. Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks. Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth. Yeah. Ahh! Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. You got a better idea? Heads. Yes! Whew! Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. Yes! There's still pie. Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today. The guy still won't put out, huh? Maybe he, uhh, drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean. Maybe he's, gay. Woah, woah, woah, you have a date? But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. You're getting a cat? What? Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, Excellent butt, great rack. Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him. Hey Phoebs. I can't find the remote. Thank you. And? All right Phoebs, way to go. So, so how did it happen? And what did he say? Wow. Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. This man is my God. Tongue? Cool. Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked? No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then. You got all that from saline solution? Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses. Hey, here's a thought, Ross. Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first. You could say that. Oh, her ankles are a little chubby. Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart? He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her? Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea. Hey, Ross! What are you doin'? Oh, yeah, I do. I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer. Hey. Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year? You gave him cookies? Oh my God. Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this. I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'. C'mon show us what you bought. You know you want to. So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears! Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through. She told us. Monica, pigeons learn faster that you. Phoebe here with the cab yet? Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7. Hey, here she comes. Hey. Hey. Yeah, big stuff. Hey. Sure is. Good luck Phoebs. How far'd ya get? Phoebs, what's goin' on? Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy. Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today. Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you. Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down? Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright. Rach, these are for you. No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. Uh-huh. And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. They're ribbed for your pleasure. I'm excited, I've never gotten reviewed before. Here it is, here it is. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king. Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason. NO, no, no, it, it's too hard. It's not worth it, I quit. When I was little I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff. No, I'm all right man, really. Hey, no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me. Alright, it still works. I just had a glass. Ohhh. Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking? Hey. Yeah, my agent just called me with and audition for Days of Our Lives. With a man? What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you? Well, I think it went pretty well, I, I got a callback for Thursday. No. OK, uhh, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady. Oh, yeah, yeah she's great but. I kinda got the feeling that she was, sort of, coming on to me. And I definately would get the part if I would of, you know, if I would have sent the Little General in. Hey. Well, the part's mine if I want it. Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady. Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives that's actually on television. Well, I guess I could sleep with her, I mean. How can I do that? I've never slept with someone for a part. Sorry. Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her. I just, I just don't think that I want it that way though, ya know. I mean, let's say I do make it, alright, I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent of because of, ya know, the Little General. Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco I had to promote it. Hey. It was unbelievable, I walked in there and she was all over me. Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way. But wait, wait, wait. Then after I left her office she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part. Soo, you are now looking at Dr. Drake Remore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes. All right, I've got to go shower. It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives. Are you really not going? Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. There's my scene, there's my scene. Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a.subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. All right, all right. Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart! I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer? They didn't fight a lot? Hey, look who's up. I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! It just seems so futile, you know? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly. How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got. No, my first fan mail. Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner? Ah, the stalker. Let's get out of here. OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met. She's comin'. Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready? Erica. Yeah it is, what? Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. No one. Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that. Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something. But that's what. Hey I. That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey. Oh my God, quick turn off the TV. Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out. Hey Erica, c'mon in. Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up? Who? It's not what you think, that was. Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor. Somebody wanna help me out here? 'Cause it's a television show. I'm not Drake. Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you. Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care. OK, alright, the people who threw the water. This is amazing. I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies. Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. Woah, dude, burn. Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he? Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me. Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'? Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of, no guys around, huh. You're blowin' me off for a monkey? Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons. Oooh. Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight? Forget about it. So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities. So what're you guys gonna eat? Ma? Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off. Are you naked in there? Huh, you uh, you always wear panties? Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes. Well, let me see. Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing. Chandler's wearing panties. Can't help you, I'm not wearing any. Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong. Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie. One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye. Aaaaagggghhhhh. Aaaaagggghhhhh. Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy. Hey. Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. Eight hundred and twelve bucks. Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man. Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. Heh, what d'ya say? Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out. Put it on. Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet. You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life? If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so. Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? You know what the. Hey. How come you have two? Get out. Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Hey Monica, what's on this video tape? What is with your nose? Some girl ate Monica. Lookin' good Mr. Cotter. Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking. Alright open your eyes. Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option. I know. Uh-huh. Whichever one you want man. Whichever one you want. Not that one. Ohh yeah, that's the stuff. We dare. What if we have to pee? Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax. Hi. What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel? She laughed at you? It certainly is a miracle. No, inside good, outside bad. Naa, she's lyin'. Is that the fire alarm? Cool. Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat? What? Yeah, so. Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain. Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. Hey. Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch. Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get? So where you gettin' it? Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two? Can you believe this place? Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes. Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man. Huh? Yeah, can you see me in a place like this? Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment. Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love. Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it. I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore. What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie. Well that's how I feel. Well then maybe I will. Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons. Hey. Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. I know. Yeah. No, we're alright. Plastic spoons. Great. These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones. Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment. I'm movin' out like we talked about. Well, it was a fight, based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or, whatever. Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry. Woah. Why do you get to keep the table? Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half. Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass. Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister? Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it. Yes! And the table is mine. Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right? Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street. Naa, you keep it, you need the practice. So, I guess this is it. Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again. Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care. Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself. Art. Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee. Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come? Right, I go-, I got it. Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh? No no no, behind it. That's right, I have a phone in here. Yeah. Hello. Hey! Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing. Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin' Oh, well great. Well OK then. Was that the oven timer? Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer? Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe. Hey, hey, they're runnin' I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think. You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad. Hey. You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin', what's with the boxes? Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet? Wow. Oh, now it's a spare room? Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys. Yeah, yeah he is. Eddie. Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail? You don't keep it over here on this table any more? Huh. No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me. So how you two gettin' along? Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice for the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice. Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man. Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh? Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which. It may not be a bed of roses. Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It' really big but it's cursed. CHANDLER: God that is good TV. Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out. Page 42, page 42, page 42. Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't ge this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it 'If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me loo good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writer look good so how could they be mad about that? They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son. No. No way, I'm not signing that. How can they do this to me? I don't feel like talkin. Hey. I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out. Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me wa me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin. PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera. JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna b as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credi card application, and I was pre approved. Huh? I've neve been pre-approved for anything in my life. CHANDLER: I'm sorry man. Hey. Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have? Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty. Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from square one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache. Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee. Anybody want a croan. So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything? No, can we get back to me? Alright. Cab driver number two? But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab? But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this. I'm sorry. See ya. What is it? See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh. It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good. Oh my God. Look at this, how did I spend so much money? Ahh. My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do. What? That's a two line part. So what. Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic. Yeah. Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.' Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe. Look, I don't wanna hear this right now. Well don't just say. Ok. I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there? Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go. Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show. I fell down an elevator shaft. What? All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks. What? Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting. No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3D last supper, Judas is a little loose. They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right. Thanks Ross. I went. I didn't get it. What? Huh? Oh, not my parrot. I can't watch this. Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register. Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though. I'll take the dog though. Hello. I know I would. Hey no problem. Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is. A little foos? What happened to the foosball? He paid a lot of money for it. Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky. Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over. Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question. No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket. Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick? I don't know. How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car? Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar. Hey. Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car. Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats. No problem. Hey Chandler. Ok. He-he-eyy. Ok. He kept my dollar. How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him. Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game. We're the guys. Man you are incredible. Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with. No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here. Oh yeah. Nooooo. Not a dad. Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel? Freaky. Monica, relax, go get a beer. Who said it was for you? You're kiddin'. Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back. Do what? See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea? Yeah good luck, good luck. Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich? Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo. Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone? Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline. Hey, hey, hey no. Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will. Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh. Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go. Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home? Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now. Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.' Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved 3.50. How come those? That is so not my motto. Good. Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it. It's a woman. Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. Hard to say. Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there. Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? By someone besides Monica? He-he-he, how's it goin'? Excellent. Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper. Cause she uh, she steals stuff. Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared. I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok. Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals. Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo. Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed. Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room. Right this is staging. This is clearly in the wrong apartment. Quick volleyball question. Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you? Ahh, you drive safe. Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care. Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection. Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? Oh no, what happened? Yeah, I've had it. But don't you need experience for a job like that? Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call. Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much, processing any more. Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks? Hey. Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie. Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh? I figure my character has kids. Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does. Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid. Ya know what? Just did. You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it. Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie. What a phony. Sir. Yeah Bing, what's that about? This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas. Joseph's good, isn't he? Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say. Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you. 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department. Karen. Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. Really? Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else. It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy. No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. I did do it, I'm a professional. See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me. Come on, I need your help here. You see this, this is a friend. Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem? Yeah, that makes sense. Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone. Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon. Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him. Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on? Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men. Aw, man I'm sorry. This must be very tough for ya, huh. Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him. Hello? Hello? Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl. I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me. Morning, hey, you made pancakes? Good morning. Kiss her! Kiss her! B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her. Come on, quite yankin' me. This is Janice. Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking. Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything. Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice? There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross? Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right? Wheel! Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore! I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to? Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers. No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair? Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know. Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember? Look, what do you want me to say? I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that. And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there. But what does that gonna do. Okay. I'm in. Does it have to be a whole day? Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room. Hey! Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy. I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did. But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium. No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway. Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross. Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too. Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex. All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. Yep, it's fat. I drank fat! We have a half hour. Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed. Hey, Ross, want some cider? Glass of fat? What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech? Am I in it? Whoa! What? How is this your seat? But then you left. What's the big deal, sit somewhere else. Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there. Soo. All right! You can have the chair. Oh my, would you look at that! I'm so sorry. Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable. Monica, how are you gonna do that? Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.' Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy. Now she sounded breezy. Okay. You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions. That's right! I'm taking the essence. Where's my underwear?! Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now. It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues. Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you. Hey, opposite, is opposite! Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando. Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed. You could drink the fat. Yaaaay! Let's see what else he'll do! WHOAA! Hey. No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. What is this? Fruit? Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? This will just be my batch. Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? You talked to him. Are you crazy? Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean. Aww. Ohh! Put your hands together. No more jam?! Check it out! Jam crackers! Yeah, the Knicks rule! Let me see. Oh, right. Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday? Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left. Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little. Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes. Hey. Where you going? Sperm or regular? So you're really doing this, huh? Sounds nice. No kiddin', hmm. No, II figured you would've picked a blond guy. I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like. Hoyt. It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool. He's got the body for it. You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know. Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids. Yeah! Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too. Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, III don't get it Maybe if they met me in person. Did I get it? You guys, can we please not watch this all right. Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way! Can we please turn this off? Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday. Hey! Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?! How is it you? Yep, that's my audition. Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance. Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents. What, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hang up, hang up. I love that movie. I'm sorry, it just felt nice. Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater. Hey, you know about that?! Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs, get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was. Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! Come on baby, come on! Thank you so much. You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in. Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two. Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you. Nooo, four. G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play? Pheebs! There you are! But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it. It's okay, these things happen. I'm, I'm okay. See. No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally. They actually said that? No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent. Okay, shoot. I didn't get it? Okay, what else? Oh. Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle. Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out. You do, thanks. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent. That's-ah what I suspected-ah. Hey! No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail. Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step. No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max. Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's. Power saw kinda got away from me there. Her what? Hey, Monica, who would yours be? It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you? Hey-hey! I know. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya? Calm down, do you want this unit or not? Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's. Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor. Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all. Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah. Relax. Here hold this. This old stuff just comes right off. Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. Eh! There you go. Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles. Ooh, very official. Why don't we just go on two. Because it's faster. All right, but in the future. So we are going on two? Wow, it's big! Maybe, my ruler's wrong. Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door. Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet. Y'know what? I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there. Get out your checkbook, mister. You are dogged man! I totally fit! Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me! Well, that’s really a different question. Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together. Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go? Hey, there’s a dog out there! Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions? Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing. Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that. Hey! Hey! Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don’t! Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush. That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination. Like you wouldn’t believe. Wow! This is a great place. Gotcha. Oh, you bet I am! You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? Whoa, ah! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade? Oh right, right. Well usually yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk. Baywatch. Lifeguards. Nicole Eggert. You'll like her. They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer? No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here. Cool! Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood? Booo! Hey, you guys! Guess what? I got a gig! Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension. Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community. I know! Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along. Hi! Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.' Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children. Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin. Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King? You want me to lie to Chandler? No. Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this. Ahh! Hey now! Hey! Oww! And I'm bleeding. Okay, great. Okay. All right. I can't see. Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. Hey-hey. Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud. You bet! What's the part? Wow! That was good. That was. Tweezers? Whoa. That was really good. Well, II might've said supergay. Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part. There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.

Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy? All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle. Okay, retract the device, retract the device. Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!

Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on. Says who? Your mom?

Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know. Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her. Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff. Fumble! What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey. All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself. Pheebs, run! After! It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl. What are you gonna do? Okay. Here you go! Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team. Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania. Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from. Whoa, whoa, no, no, II'm not playing with this guy, now. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question. Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex. This sucks, I was just up by that much! Thirty seconds left on the timer! When they're hungry enough, they'll come in. And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees. What? Me having a job? Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy. Hey. What, what are you doing here? Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas. Sure. All right. Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back. Well we have to make room for the fresh ones. Well, they go into the chipper. Hey! Hey! All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's. Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff? If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear. Hey! I got great news! What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions? Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview? Not a problem. And now for the great news. Only if you think it's better than this, snow-in-a-can! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie. Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell. Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper. Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here. Ten, ten, nine, nine, nine, eight, eight, eight. Okay, Blast off! Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it? All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts. I can't tell you that, no. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me. Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know. I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around. Chandler! Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka. No, only for sex. Hey! Hey-hey-hey! Can I talk to you for a second?! Come on! I just got off the phone with my sister. MaryAngela. Yeah. Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister. Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree. Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah. She's right in there. What's goin' on? What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was MaryAngela? Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?! No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler. No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to MaryAngela. All right. Cookie, now you can punch him! All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy? Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco. What? Who? The what? Oh, okay. The what? You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two. Really? Thanks. Excellent, I'll be there. Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either. Yeah, I can dance, y'know. Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty. Whoa, I'm not done. Done. Mark's a genius! And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Harddd,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!' So, does that mean the audition is off? What?! It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. Bye. I know, it was the best I could get out of them. People, people, people. Look at you. Since when do you roller blade? Cool. Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex. Hey. Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late. I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue. Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so. Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know. Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again? The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours. All right, you got it. Okay. Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little? These little women. Wow! Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her. But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining. No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times. What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the. Hello! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met. Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies? Hey! How's it going? Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining? Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub. All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway? Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww! Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad. Beth, Beth dies? Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die? Then why would you say that?! Beth is really, really sick. Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do. Yeah. Okay. Wow! This girl is good. So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles. Ah, anything we might of heard of? Wow, that was kinda brutal. Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his. Whoa-oh! Phew, close one. Hey. Is ah, is Chandler around? Oooh. Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer? Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did. What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life. All right! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner. I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log. I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg. I ran! Morning. Heard about the leg burnin' huh? Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Where have you been? Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives? Done. So Pheebs what's this guy like? Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again? Yeah! Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it. Both of us? We'll be there. Uh, 10:30. 4:30. Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us? She was kidding about that right? God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh? Dude, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing. Ah! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we, y'know each would, y'know be? Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails. So what are you gonna do? Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny. Nothing, he's just really believes in that. Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh? Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble. Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild. All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. Did you think about the trail? The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail! Yeah, II think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax. Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off? Don’t answer that. Awful! Horrible! She was nothing compared to you. Ewwwww! Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. Why not?! I’m hungry. Yeah, we’ll be fine. Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza. You think I need a new walk? Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk. Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay. Maybe she killed him? No, I really have to pee. Can I see the comics? Okay, may I see the comics? Yeah, you shoulda been there last night. Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler. Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other. Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now. I had the same dream! Oh, I had the opposite dream. Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship. Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear? Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside. Oh yeah. You’re smoking again?! Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here! It’ll be great for next weekend. It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, it’ll be grrreat. Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay. Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross? What? Mine aren’t tinted. Oh, now I have to go! What’s going on? Relax okay, III can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger? Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra! Come on! Who has the biggest boobs? Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire. If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call. Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous. And there you go! Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed. Okay, done. That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air! Arrrghh! Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along? II can’t handle this, you guys. What? What? Yeah, and not put us in the middle. Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who? Come on man, you drove all the way up here. Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh. What-what’s so funny? Yeah, or-or to get a hooker. Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it. Well, have-have you told him how you feel? So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, let’s just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88. Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet! Yeah, in a poem maybe. Now, wh-what, what is that like? Why can’t I find that? Well, I want it! I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me. Then you hold on to it!

With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’ Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know? Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.

He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do? Tell us! So you’re the gynaecologist? And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal. What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath. Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. Yeah. What are we getting? Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad? Hey, the fight’s starting! Fight’s over! Check it out, he’s winning! Pete’s winning! No-o-o! Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography. Well, I think we all learned something. That you're actually 50? Hey, Bonnie had sex there! Hey! No, it's just my luggage. Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah! Hey-hey, check out the hat! Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is? I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker. Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law! Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring? What? Okay, all right. Fan out! Fan out! OH YES! Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff. All right, relax. It's just a shoe. Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you. Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff? We're playing Strip Happy Days Game! What's the matter, Pheebs? What?! But I made cards! Wanna play strip poker for practice? I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together! So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on. Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight? Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler. and he couldn't let it go, and. I don't really know what happened with that either. Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either. Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it? Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole! Oh no! No! My hole! What?! What?! What is it?! Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole. Well, there's really only one thing you can do. You're gonna have to pee on it. Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel. If you want some privacy you can use my hole. Me too. No? Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about. It's between us and the sea, Ross! Nope. All right. Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive! Monica got stung by a jellyfish. And I was tired from digging the huge hole! I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel. That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler. That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out. How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide. Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands! All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them. Looks good, uh? Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks! What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant. Oh. What do you do? What? What's wrong? Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni. Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out. Pretty nice? Good for you! Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways! Uh, Pheebs, about your mom. How's that going? That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee. This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man. Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin. Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit. Okay. See?! I told ya! Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel! WHAT?! Yeah. Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs! Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man! I was tryin' to make a sale! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do? Aww, man, he took the five of spades! Oh, no-no-no, here it is! Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here! Hey! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. Huh?! Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! Just pickle. Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, II knew what he meant. Uhhhh. No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there. Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in. He cut off his ear. I’m out. Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there? In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer. Spock’s birth control. Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. In a minute. Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have 1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’. How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time? You wanna see what I got? Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey! And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants. Oh, II think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out. Wh-what’s going on? No he doesn’t! Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius. Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation. Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant. Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War? Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry? I m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson. All right that s it, school is in session! Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord. Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry. I have actually not heard of that. Why don t you tell me something I don t know! He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey mouths Oops! Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he d better come up here and apologize. I ll see you later. He said that he wasn t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he s gonna do is have you evicted! I ll see you later. Well he made Rachel cry! All right! I ll try! But if I can t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled. All right, all right, all right. I mean I ll have to check with him first, but I ll think he ll be cool with it. Please don t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn t their fault, it was mine. No you can t do that, where would the chick and the duck live? Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I m the chick and Chandler is the duck. Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I ll do whatever you want. Yeah-yeah, absolutely. What, what is it? That s not, prison lingo, is it? Yeah, there s this superintendent s dance, the Super Ball. I don t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he has a crush on. Well, he s too shy, he doesn t think he s good enough to dance with girls yet. Aww, man, now we won t be bank buddies! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I m doing something exciting and I don t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler! No-no, thank you. All right, I m here, let s ahh, get this over with. Whoa-whoa, don t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk? No, it s okay, but if I m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back. Come on man, you re not a potato. Come on Treeger, don t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let s ahh, let s try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y know, I m not really that comfortable dancing with a. We-he! Hey! Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. What? No I didn t. No, I m not! And it wasn t a hop it was a pademarie. All right, well maybe I m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I m getting pretty good at it. Hey-hey, hold on, this isn t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it s like a sport, it s manly! All right. I don t know how to lead. What?! So you ah, ready for our last practice? Look, you wanna use our place? We did it! I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful. Oh well, okay, good luck. Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango? Okay. Go get em Treeger. Really? No, I m good. Hey! Hey, I see you guys already met, huh? Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off. Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters. Hey. Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet. Hey! Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight? It's 4:30. Okay, I see what's going on here. Yeah! You don't like Kathy. Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right? Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right? Is she great or what? I'll be right back. What was that? Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal. I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend. Well then, do it better! Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little. Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind? Hey! Why? You can pee here! We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something? Oh, I know. Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? Why not? Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over. Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey! She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I. Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? Or, just get a card that has a poem already in it. So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? Yeah. Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? All right, so, next time, you take her to your place. What kind of smell? All right, listen, Ross, you like this girl, right? You wanna see her again, right? So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! Yeah. Yeah! All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink! Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you! Our place, the hall! I. A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe? You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? Wow. That's almost as much as a new book. Hey! Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now. Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! Hey! You know, uh. Chandler got you a gift, too. Yeah, he did, look, look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho! Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed? Oh, uh, don't forget your coupon. Hey, that coupon expires, you know. Great! All right, so I ll call you later. That would be Casey. We re going out tonight. No, things are fine with Kathy. I m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? What is the big deal? It s not like we re exclusive. You got all that from the back of her head? Who s Elaine? Hey, it s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble. We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I ll be there as soon as I can. Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to. Yeah? Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more. Hey dude, it s me. Listen uh, I m really sorry, it looks like I m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn t there! Yeah, it must ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog. Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. Aww man! I can t believe I locked myself out again! Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this? Why? Well, you re amazing. A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I m gonna do that. No-no-no, I think I m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She s pretty cool. No-no, Kathy. No. No, Kathy. Y know what I think? I think somebody s got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think? Hey! Samboucha Margarita? Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now. What s up? You do? Well, you re timing couldn t be better. She s not my girlfriend anymore. Yeah, she broke up with me. Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that s why I let people watch. Well, I ve been better. But, I m all right. So you like her huh? No-no-no, no it s uh, it s okay. Yeah. You know why? Cause you can to me first. But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you re work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she s into some other guy. So. Who? What? And what?! Did you sleep with her?! What?! That s even worse! I don t know! But it s the same! Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you! Over the line?! You-you re-you re so far past the line, that you-you can t even see the line! The line is a dot to you! Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I m not gonna eat! You know why?! Because it s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I m not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. Hello. Hello. Stop callin'! All right! Hey! I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. No! I'm putting that in my room. Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? Five years. Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. Yeah! What? All right. But if you weren't my best friend. Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler? My folks. I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment. Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I. Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya. Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving. When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down! Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around! We've got a box. What's twisted? Ewwwww! Ew! Ew! Ew! He's fine! Chandler? Hey! He's doin' some thinkin'! You kissed my girlfriend! That doesn't sound like thinking to me! Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes! All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box! So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously? That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay. I'll get it. Hey. That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at. In the box. Open the box! He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there! Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out! Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there. Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa! All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade. Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police. I think I know that girl. Oh yeah, I definitely know her. Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book? Well, why do you call him Gandolf? No, I had sex in high school. Will you calm down, he's just a human guy. Really?! All right, I'll see you guys. I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon? Okay. Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf. So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'? So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves! Well, we could do that! We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! All right? Let's go! All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out. So, we're having fun, right? We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing. Are you serious?! Thank God! I'm exhausted! Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf. I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad. Yeah, I know. Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends. We're 29, we're not women. Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now? Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas. Ohhh! Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me? Good enough to get fired. Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials? What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole. Sure! Where are the seats? Now, wait a second! You make food and robots? Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that! Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? Hey! Damn! Hey. Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket? You got it! Oh-oh! It's still a tiny bit on fire there. Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname. There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one! No ma'am. I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, Wow! It's been a long time since I had. 327 238 dollars! And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you. Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in. Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it! You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all. What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller! Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year. Lean-lean-lean! Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me. No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period. Yeah, but I can pronounce Jurassic. You're really thinking of having sex with your brother? Oh. Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy. Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period. Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. Okay, now right down here we have, uh, a large foot. Okay, moving right along. Come on. Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross. Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname. Well, uh, how come? That's crazy. I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it. Ross, Ross, over here man. I saved you a seat. It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right? Whatever. Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. I will sit with you Dr. Geller. I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs. You hang in there Ted! It's the chick! She's going through some changes. Good luck. And I'm still right! She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants. Yeah, what's that about? Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag? Six. All right, we'll start with apples. Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt. Okay, the last thing. No-no, not for like another two weeks. Serious? No! All right, who-who makes up the questions? Huh. I know. Animals dressed as humans. The Irish gig guy?! It's All Relative. Nana? Althea! I took a shot. Hey, no way, that rooster's family! What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise! Look, we are not gonna. Dah! Oooooh! Okay. Big fat goalie. Weekend at Bernie's. Everyday use. Guest. Uhh, 11! I call Monica's room! Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it. What? Hey, ooh Pheebs, are they in there? Oh wow! You can tell this soon. What?! You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet! Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes! But it is our apartment! Did you see the size of the closets?! Hey! There's gravy? I think I left a donut up here. Hey! That-that is a good trick. Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble. Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage? Noooo! Hey Mon! Want some pancakes? Yep! Grab a plate. No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer. Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over. Oh yeah, who's playing? All right Pheebs, stick out your plate! I don't know, it smells good. Wow! The new Playboy! Come here. Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on! Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on. Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, Hey, how you doin'? Hey, how you doin'? Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes! Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket? What the heck is that? No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that! Dude, tell me she actually told you this. Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry. Okay, for next time, what do you say? What's ready? I don't know, it looks the same. Oh yeah! How'd it go? Guggly worm. Glow-pop giggly jammer. Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, Joey, what are you doing with your life? stuff. I can say, Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life? Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two. Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club. Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women. Yeah. Hey-hey! Oh my God, you guys have no idea. Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing? Hey buddy! How's it going? Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah! Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here! Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it. Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here! Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip! Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad? Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is? No-no, it's uh, it's Heston. Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice. Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be? Interesting. How ya doin'?

Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there. Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey! That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how. Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun. No, I don't think so. Who's seven? Ahh, the babies miss me? What? You ordered pizza without me?! Two pizzas?!

No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica! Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you? My Giant? I love that movie! Can I ask you something? Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant. Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing? I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there? Thanks man. But what about how much taller he is than me? I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man? Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour. Had the beef-tips, huh? Hi! All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck. Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days? Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in! Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some? Okay. You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans? All right! Mornin' Pheebs! Was his name Angus? Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London. Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh. Hey, Ross, Bodington's! That was good beer. Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys. Later! I bet it was about her a little. Say that to him and you're golden. Hey, Pheebs! See ya! What the hell was that?! Havin' some trouble? I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar. All right. Good deal. Uh, okay, Pheebs? Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out? All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together! Yeah, all of us! All day! Phoebe! Mine! Nooo, I said we needed a new plan. Which, is the new plan! Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking? Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts? I gotta get the before shot! Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! Ooh, something hurts! Are they? I didn't know I cared that much. Oh my! Not in my head. Yep! There's always room for JellO! Oh, it's easy. Yeah, II can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad. Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies. Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them. Yeah, I was bummed too. I think Saturday-. Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up! Umm, well, what else could it be? Or? Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up. Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? Are you crazy?! Ohh, get these things out of me! I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! Argh! Argh! Oh my God. They're so small! Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out! He's talking to London! Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. Ross! Way to suck up to the family. Hey! Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned. Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host! A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do! Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs? I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish! Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right? It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry. Well, may I ask for one example? That's because all people are selfish. Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right? That he doesn't exist. How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya! That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. But I'm the host! You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray. Hey Mon! See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure. Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? Hello New York! PBS telethon. What?! What good is that gonna do anybody? Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya. Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me? Come on man! You've been here all day! PBS Telethon. Hey Pheebs! 200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya? And you don't a little good about donating the money? A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks. Monica? What time is it? But it's dark out. I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. Hey! Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean. Hi! So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it. Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here. You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth. Hey, you're back! How was your conference? Oh, so your weekend was a total bust? Hey, you're back too! Hey, how was your chef thing? What are you guys woofing about? Nooooo! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots! You want my advice? You're not gonna like it. You got married too fast. I told ya. Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it. Hi, Rach. III don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. Hey, you're not Kip! Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip? Oh, that poor bastard. Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room. 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. Y'know, II don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?! Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. Oh! Ohh! Oh! Oohh! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh! Ohhhhh! You?! And-and you?! How?! When?! IN LONDON! But it is a big deal! I have to tell someone! All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but. Aww, I don't want to see that! I guess I'm done. I think I'm gonna take-off. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! None of that, not while you're living under my roof! Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it. Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about. I can hear that! I can still hear you! Hey! Argh-argh! Ooh, soft. Is this mink? Hey, Ross, you're okay with that? What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies? No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us! No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool. I'll take it! Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think? What's the matter Ross? That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail! Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow! He's not even here! Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard? Yeah, you fogged Danny. Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little? Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? You do have a choice! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?! It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-Owww! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. We all hate Emily! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Unreasonable! I kinda feel like it's my fault. Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk. Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you. Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today. Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone. I'm not sure. RACHEL PLEASE! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US! All right, II'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor. It's almost as if he knew. Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel! I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling. You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile! What happened? What happened? No, look. I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her. Why? Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya! Yeah. Okay. Ross? Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't. I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine. Hey, all right! You're fake laughing too, right? Hey. Nothing. Kinda. Dude, you should've gone out once and a while. Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort! Sorry. Ahhhh! Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please? No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on! All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? No, the quiet down thing! Um-hmm! Look, III don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn? All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game. YES! Um-hmm. Hey! You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed! Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?! Umm, yum! Mine! Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian! But it's available now! Isn't it? Hey, let's go look at it! Okay! Yeah! Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place. But hey, Ross, this place is available now! Yeah. Oh, it's perfect! He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen? Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet! Yeah! Yeah! I don't know. Maybe pizza? Oh! Oh! Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable. Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! Hey! You're kidding! But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay! Definitely! All right! Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea! I need something sweet. Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having. Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there? Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out! Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories. Hey, it's not like it sounds. Hello? Phoebe? Look. I know! It's stuck! I put it on to scare Chandler! Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here. It's Joey. I can't! It-it's stuck! Sorry! Sorry. It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha! Yeah, there you are! I scared you! Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, Butternut squash? And it came out, Squatternut buash? You're a dork. Yeah, they're mine. I don't know uhh. Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes. Chandler? A word. That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8? Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and. Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't. Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier! All right! But, you do it with me once. Didn't think so. Hey, Pheebs! What's wrong buddy? I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch. So you uh, still wondering? You're smart. I like that. Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait! Hiya. I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here! Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig! Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place? Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet! All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice! Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just. I just. Kinda. Thank you! What?! No I'm not! No! No! I am not a sex addict! No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth! I slept with Monica. Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London. Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? Ahh oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica? No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London! That makes sense! Uhh, Monica? But sadly I could not be enticed. Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed? Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh come here sit down. Ready? Ahh! Ohh, yeah! Huh?! Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. Shhh. Hello Mr. Bing. I love you. But, I love you. And that’s Wednesday. Ohh. So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing? How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens. She’s a woman! Okay, is there anything else? That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it? Wait a second, I could star in it! I can't write! Y'know I mean III'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know. I can't do it. Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! Thanks! Done! It's not. Oh. Hey, how do you spell suspicious? Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff. You're driving me crazy with that! Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot! Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now. Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule. All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts. Uh yeah, right here. Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing. You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work. Hey! I didn't finish my five pages. Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played. Come on look guys, don't fight. Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors! Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture. I didn't have my camera! Yeah, wow, sorry Rach. They're brother and sister! Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today! No dude, Ross tore up the tickets! Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me? Okay. It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out. Ross. Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going. A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end. No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha! Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out. What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter! All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey! What's the matter?! All right, I'll take care of it. Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe? Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister. Chandler. Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler? Yeah. Okay, great! Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight! Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight. So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler? Yeah! So did that do anything for ya? All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar. Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true. Really? Who-who have you taught? Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs! Nice! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today? You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name? Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. Umm, okay. Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and. No. Yes! Yeah! You look like a freak. Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. Yes! Yes, I did. G-sharp. What?! I didn't touch a guitar! No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?! Your other student, was you! Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR! Hello? Uhh, Chandler's not here. Okay. Nice! Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder? Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up. Umm, do you see any oh, Vaseline? Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there. Ross? You okay? Really?! Uhh, what color is it? Well, I'm just if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference! Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place. What-what is it, what is it? Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know! I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone! And you're not supposed to be gossiping! I'm not listening to you! Hey, Pheebs? Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready? Wow! Cool! Was the chord at least right. Howdy partner! Umm? Oh, no! Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah! Now? You want me to go over there now? Do you know something? I might know something. What's the thing you know? I can't tell you what I know. Okay, fine. You don't know! YOU KNOW! Yeah, I know! Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen. Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain. Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it. Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Ohh, I know one thing! They did it right there on the couch. Hey Ross! Anybody gonna eat that? All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? Really? Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. All right, let's go Pheebs. Maybe we should check the trash chute. That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there. He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. He hooked up! Tell us about her! All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind. Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! Damnit Phoebe! All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay? All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off! Judge rules, no violation. Yeah! What?! And the duck gets the NutterButter! Judge rules, NutterButter. Yeah. Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here? Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate. Umm, hi. Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her. Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff. Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this. Great! Thanks, Rach! All right. Are you all right? Pheebs! Sorry! Pheebs, I'm so sorry. All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then. Really? A purse? It looks like a women's purse. See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man. Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago. Well, I ain't gonna say no to that. Hey! What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. Why would I return it? I love this bag! Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you. UNI-sexy? Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry. Here, I brought you some flowers. Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me. What did you say to him? Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look? Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag! Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink. Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should. I'm sorry, can I ask you something? Well, first it's not a purse. I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag! All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them! Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves. Yeah but I didn’t read anything. Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it! Hi. Estelle said I didn't get it. Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag! Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway! I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag! I can't believe I'm hearing this! Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string! Hey guys! What? What? You mean how they're friends and nothing more? Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them. I can't take any. Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know! Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. Ugh. Yeah? Well I didn't tell them! Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey. And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell! I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing! No! Not unless! Look this must end now! I'm listening. So he likes to break stuff. Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming. No. They know you know. I couldn't even if I wanted too. Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend! Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair! Ooh! I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! It's not my first time. Dude! All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows! Dude! He's right there! Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, III'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister. I call Godfather! Sure, if you cared enough to call it first. Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie. So, are you ready to go? Oh sure, right back there. I was thinking Chinese food. I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but. She keeps punching me. Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me. Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny. Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. II really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat. No-no. Yeah, big! Uh-oh, shht! The Misses. Hey! Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters? Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love? Hey! Hiya! Huh. Uhh. Nah. What a bad idea! She's right y'know. Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife? Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it. That's not funny at all! Hey! What are you guys doing up? Dark red. Aww, you guys are so cute! All right, I'll see you in the morning. Hey, you guys! Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt? Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him. No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica! No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry. Hey! Oh. Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here. What?! Why?! Nothing! All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it. Well, it involved Monica. Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two-ish. Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out. It-it doesn’t? That kinda sounds like your dream dude. In the dream I did enjoy the closeness. Not really. No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have? Friends first? That's interesting. No, never done that either. How you doin'? Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you. Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight. Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those. Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great. is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, Who are my friends? You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So. I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch. I'll treat you real nice. Won't-won't that take longer? Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first! Hey! Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. Uhh, well, she's really good in bed. Well look, hey, it's all your fault! Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate! Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud! All right! Hey, who wants pizza?! Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor? Uhh, just a minute officer! Boy, that guy's underwear sucks! I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there. That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before. Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me. Yeah, III'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, III'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor. Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck! This is your place? But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! Ugh! I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair? What happened? You kissed him?! I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it? Yeah! No? Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back! No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it! Damnit! Did you move?! Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there? Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl? Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl! Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'? I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left. I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting. Dahhhhh! No! Noooo! Okay, pick a card. All right now, memorize it. You got it? Is that your card? Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition. I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?! Luck! Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month. Ross! We're having a surprise party for Rachel! Done. They're gonna do it together. What, so I gotta shut it down now? Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial? Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather. What?! Are you kidding?! All right! Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition! I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her. Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad! That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad? I look more like him than you do! Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback. Yeah I did! Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so. Who knows? Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. Hey Pheebs! Hey! Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something. Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition. That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here! I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben! What? Chandler! Tell 'em! At least I care about his feelings! Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it? Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger! You just give him a spoon baby! Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch! Yeah?! So's yours! Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup! Oh yeah, no problem. Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle. Ross! Hi! Uh-oh. Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup. Oh, what did I say? How's that different? Oh! Yeah! Hmm, noodle soup. Okay. Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup! No! No! II can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! Hey. Yeah right! Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, Hmm, noodle soup. What you do mean? Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me. Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor. No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed. Thank you! So, did-did he get it? Eh, what are you gonna do? Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother! Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English. She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me. Yeah, I uh weighed like 27 pounds when I was born so. Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian? Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later. Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. True story! Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God. Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. Oh, they cut me out of the show. Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there. I'm in it. I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died. No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me. All right, it's another commercial I still haven't told her! I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh! Yeah, all right. Ooh! Hey! Is the show still on? Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?! Oh, here I am, here's my big scene! All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it! That's right! Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with 100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it. Choo! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck! I'm comin' out! That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's! Oh, yeah, good idea. Ooh, Ross, look! Look! Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look! Somebody help me out here! You got to go on a ride along?! I want to go on a ride along! Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world! Oh-ho, yeah! Yep! Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car. Yeah, okay. Did I say you could smell it?! Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness! Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had. Are you thinking about Monica? Yeah, what's that like? Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up? Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop! Yeah, what's up with that Serpico? Is everything okay? You okay man? Hi. Yeah, I didn't know that. Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! Dude! How come you took off? Is something wrong? Okay. That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross! Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture. I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing! Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I knew, you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us! Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich. I know it doesn't make much sense. Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it! I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world! No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother! Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here. No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog! How good is that? See? Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez! Yeah, hero sandwiches. Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. Hey, what time is it? Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. Oh, II, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose! Hey! What the hell is that?! That, is not a cat! I have to agree with Joey on this one. It's not a cat! It's not a cat! Uhh, the ball thing. Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! Okay! Uh-oh. I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom! Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it! Maybe this should be more of a quiet game. Hi! I don't know. Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it. Yeah, we haven't dropped it in. Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. That's right baby. Oh yeah, that's right! Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat! I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game! Did you get your money back? Oh hey, here Pheebs. Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around? Uhhh, mine too! Yeah. Me too! Me too! Me too! Yeah, I got too excited! Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE! It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears. But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, Where's Betsy? Right? And she says, Betsy's been dead for 10 years. And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy! Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday! All right! Thanks Pheebs! Oh umm, not go. I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right? Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route? Great! Problem solved! Well, back to square one. Yes! Peanut butter! A swimmer! Monica. Oh, huh, I always thought it would be Rachel. Ascot! North route! Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come! Hey man, what's up? Sure, what do you want to see? Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game! I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay? What do you like better action or comedy? Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing. Hey! You ready to go? Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him! Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room. Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket. Did you not hear the plot of the movie? She's been dead for ten years. I'm gonna be a millionaire! Hey! You got it! Bye-bye! Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car? See ya! Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon. Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch. You wanna eat? My treat! Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat? Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear! Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry? Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no? Is this movie gonna be my big break? What?! Dude you said, No! You don't think this is going to be a big break for me? I don't believe this! What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie! Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break. Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, III'd rather be alone. Not if you're gonna be like this! Yeah! I don't want you on the trip! Fine! Get out! Get out! Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests! Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car. Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it? Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work. Wh-what?! Why?! You're kidding right? What?! Uh, hang out?! How long? No! Yeah. Thanks. Congratulations on your big break. Hey Monica, it's Joey! Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you! Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here! Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'. Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now. Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me? Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner. That's it! Thanks Pheebs! No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real! Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes. Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on? Don't come out here! I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here! Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here! Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. Hi! What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come. Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break. They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here. Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man. Yeah, what-what's going on? Dawson?! Aww, there we go. Ooh, so close. Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding. Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat. Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right. All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today. Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won 5,000. Can you believe that? 5,000! Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this 100 and turn it into 5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again! Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through! Can I change a hundred? Let's ride. Hit me! Ohh man! Wait! Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin! My identical hand twin! What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror! Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire! Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands! This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh? Hey, are you unsupporting me again? Pheebs! I found my identical hand twin! Hey-hey-hey you made it! All right! Hey-hey! Who's your friend? He's hot! No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin! My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine! Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb. Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy? He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See? Okay! How you doin'? Right! Okay. Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies! It's me, Joey! Joey! Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?! Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand! But you haven't even heard the chorus! Hey! Hi! Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate! Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'? Ross, don't let her drink anymore! Ahhh! No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway. Ooh-ho-ho! Hit me! Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table? Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue? Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin! Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hey! Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here? Well! What happened?! Did we miss it? Mornin’ Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled. Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight? I don’t need that anymore. I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh ooh! How about you come with me? It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship. Sure? Hey. Where is the waitress?! I’m starving! Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! Sure! What’s up? Oh my God! That’s huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, Ross. Do not say, Ross. Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material. Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved. They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk! An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here. What?! All right. All right. Really? I don’t. I wanna rock and roll all night! Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?! Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play! Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on! Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you. Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas. Yes. That is incredible! You are the master! What are you doing? I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out. I’m not finished. Hey Monica! Hey man, you feeling any better? Oh my God! You’re pregnant! Wow! Well, uh. Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later. Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you’d believe that. This sucks! Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm. Oh-oh he always, he always umm. Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s? Can’t, its not there. Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. Hi. Hey! I did not cry my eyes out! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s! So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up? Really?! Well, when? Wow. Great! Oh-oh, what about Ross? Dude! What are yo you trying to kill me?! Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute? Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place. Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right? Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you. I don’t know! How about, Thanks for taking the message. Jeez! Hey, what’s up? But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend! Everything on your application looks really good. Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out? Whoa! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay? Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it. That thing was a hazard! I’m very safety conscious. Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea? Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together! That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone. And then, bamn! She finds you! I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want? Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier. Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. It’s okay, I mean I, look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that! Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day! Hi! Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists! Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind. Okay! Here we go. Pillow. Very good! Okay. G. Excellent! Okay umm, doggy. Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but, bye-bye! I can’t believe she would say that too you. Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper? Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it. Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide? Why not?! Hey! Any good mail? Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda. Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a movie called benefits lapsed. Let me see that! Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?! All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent. look both ways before you cross the street. Hey Estelle, listen. What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent! Yeah! Estelle, you gotta get me some work. II lost my health insurance. Why? Bastard! Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time. What?! Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious. No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s! Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing. Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too. Hey! Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn’t hurt that bad. Sure, now I’m scared. Yeah, but I don’t wanna die! Okay. Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you. Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just hold on one second. Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you! So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! Exactly. Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn’t get it, did I? Yeah, okay. Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani I’m here to audition for man. Yes! Thank you. Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower. Hiya! Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. Take good care of your Momma son. Take good care of your Momma son. Come on son! Your Momma’s good people! Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action? Okay. Take good care of your Momma son. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter. Hey-hey-hey! Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours? Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys? There’s a lost and found? My shoe! Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. Great! Thanks. Yeah, it’s not mine. Yeah, it’s mine. Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats? It’s got ‘em! Hey guys! Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there! You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments. The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow? Yeah, she tops out at 130. And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate. Sure! Okay, take it easy. Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it. Oh II uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up. Yeah, but it’s my wax. Sure. Here. I’ll uh, save your parking spot. Why not? Yeah, so did I. So the Porsche guy took his car back. No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right? Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche? Porsche. Hi! How are the Gellers? Hey! It’s Porsche! Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! Hey! How you doin’? I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? Right! And when is that due? And that’s every month? Ahhh. Oh my God! No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity anymore. No! Forget it! Okay, I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on. This is how much we pay for electric?! Hey! I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I’ve got Ben. Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money. Okay, you’re on. Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! 500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food. You serious? Okay, get ready to owe me! Okay, here we go. Ready? This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and 500. Nah, not my game. Well, what’s it called? I don’t know how to play Cups. All right. A two and a five. Really?! A four and a nine. No. Why? Damn! I am good at Cups! Well, what did you have? Uh, wow, 700. Yeah. What? Really? Hey! Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost 1,500 to him in Cups! The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the DCup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’! And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups. No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a. I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate. It’s him, not it! Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again! Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said No, you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss, is you. And now the dog. Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate! Yeah, she's gonna live with me! I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name! From the land down under? I didn't know that either! You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer! Oh, hey let me. Of course I did. When can you move in? Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out! Oh God, yeah. Okay! Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her! Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt. You a little sad about that sweetheart? I Gotcha! Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great! I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer. Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin? Ohhhh man. No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too. Uh-uh nothing. IIII didn't want you to touch me cause I'm I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God! Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret? This is great, this is great, what else, what else? Uh, don't you mean for whom? Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before ba dum bum cheshhh. All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do? Oh! Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on. Oh, I do. How you doin? What?!?! Oh dear God! Hey. Sure, neighbor come on in. Uh, no, she’s at dance class. Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad. It is? No. No. All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her. I’m a man. Hmm. Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something? Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of. Okay, uhh. Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s too girly. Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We.we can’t have that. Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here. Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can. I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on, and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom? Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook.and smells different. Yeah, well, it feels different. Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels. Also what is with these chips you bought? Well that’s like summer in a bowl. Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders. So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer. Ohh, I love birds. What? Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby. No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.

And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you. Did she just ask me out on a date? Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’ OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright?

In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment. But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again? No. 3, 2, Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready. Hey! Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine? Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her! Oh we kissed it up real nice. I came over here to tell you guys. Okay. Okay. Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever! Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks! I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed! I was tired! Hey! I made that for her! Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage. And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man. Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine. Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right? See ya tomorrow! What? What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler? Blah?! Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem. I guess.

Yeah, she’s been in there all day, uh high fever, a nose problem. Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm! ‘Kay! No-no, she really is sick! Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold. Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry. Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud. I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick! I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing? Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise. I can hear you! Hey! So uh, what are you guys doing? Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine. Ha-ha, very funny. Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me! That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars! You don’t think I know that! Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time? Oh well then, good night! See? Eh, wasn’t that fun? All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! You two go home! III gotta talk to Janine! All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends you can’t treat them that way. I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They. They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, II. I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t. I’m very upset. Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. Yeah uh, what am I gonna do? Yeah! How ya doin’? Pretty much, yeah. Well, when it’s not right, you know it. Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right. What? You’re right! That did cheer me up! Hey guys. Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right? Let’s go watch it at your place. Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses. No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today. It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know. I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill. No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book. Sure. Not so much. You forget how many great songs Heart had. Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it. Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff. Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just. Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends. What?! Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone? I finished my book. Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there. Sure. Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there. You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there. You got it. Just being friendly. Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. No. Yeah? It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction. I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys. Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird. See, now it’s weird again. Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover. Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin. Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition. Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’ Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but. Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’ No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh? So, you’d hire me, right? Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it. Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so. Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me. Yeah, what are ya gonna do? That’s great. Thanks Rach. I’m not answering that. Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, 4.50. Ross, double latte, 2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25. So, all together that’s 12.75. Hi! Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani. Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him but uh, I could check with him. He says it’s okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye! It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever! How about a scone on the house baby? Hey, how you doin’? Are you all finished here? Great! What?! Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it? Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest? Sorry! That’ll be 3.85. It’s just I can’t because my manager said I. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie. Amy! Happy birthday to you! Yeah, not it here it isn’t. Happy birthday to you! What? No-no it’s her birthday! But it really. Damnit! Oh-ho, and mine! Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh. Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing? Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister! I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years. Yeah you got 5 years left! You wanna make it 6?! You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died? Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy? Okay, what if the puppy said, Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me. No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all! You’re dead inside! So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya? Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan! Movies? I don’t think so. Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star! Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like. Sort of. Phoebe’s a porn star! Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker. All right well, I’d better take that back. We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe! No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it! Yeah. You sick bastards! Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it! Hey! Oh no, not you too! Nice! That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star? You do? Yeah. What is the matter with you?! Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who’s Barry and Mindy? Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her? I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way. Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there’s Carol again! So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh? Wow! Oh dear God, let me think. Hey. Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money? Really? That’s an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her? That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that! Oh right great! Welcome aboard! All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break! I know, here-here! Hi! Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans. She’s not crazy is she? So uh, how you doin’? Hey there you are! All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right? Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready! All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning. Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man! All righty, what do you say we head back to my place? Why? Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us? Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now. Okay, you watch too much TV. Thanks! Yeah, there’s pulp in that. I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay? Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it. Iced tea. Did I not just tell him? Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya? Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. II was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise? Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here. Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it. Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?! Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang! Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it! I know. Yeah, his name is Pat. Do you uh, do you ready for a refill? Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong. It’s uh, right through there. Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it? Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own. Yeah you did. Here you go. Let me ask you a question. When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are? Come, come here. Morning! Yeah. Well he actually saw you a little bit too. No! No! No, not after seeing that. Wh-why? That’s ridiculous! I’m not a Star, just a regular famous actor. Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me. Wow! Uh okay, well uh. Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it. Yes! Yes! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for. Look, do you want the ring or not?! Hey! All right! Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya? Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I. You? Wow! All right! So, was it amazing? Just okay. Did you do it right?! Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean? But you got to be with both of them, right? Not the other one? Yeah, you don’t want that. Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right? You got a little bored? Yeah? What did ya have? Sounds good. Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong? Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?! All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth. Why did I do that?! Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time! No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh? Yeah? Uhh do it? Well, where was I? Takes it out of you? Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas? And of course, crotchless panties. You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut. Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids. Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in? Thanks. Well but this one starts now. But it’s 2,000. Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists. 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’. Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! Look, I got to apologise on the behalf of Carl. Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is. Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up. Pizza! We like Pizza! Get out! All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be? That’s right! And what are you not gonna do? Damnit Carl! That’s us. That’s right, 2,000. Damnit Carl! Oh hey, do you still have their final exams? Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90. No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old. Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director? Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition! No-no-no, please-please Chandler III would owe you so much! Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what? All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday? Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?! Okay. The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be! Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday? Oh, how bad is it? Chandler, is that. Hey-hey listen. When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza? Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time? Ah-ha! Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that’s where the napkin is. I know! This is where I keep the pizza. And. Hey! Where did the napkin go?! Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is. Uhh. Uhh. Okay. Well, I have to go now. Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart. Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday? You couldn’t do it?! Ah whatever! No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it. Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s! Yeah! Look! I know. All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. Hey, here you go. Oh, very funny.

Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’? All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred. Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks. Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler. Ooh! So close. Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her? Huh. The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes. Hey, what was in that brown jar? Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me? No! No! No! For my new fridge our new fridge! So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple. And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid. Give me 400! Or! You can just, y’know. What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge! Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be 400! You pushed him! All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet. I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge! Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge you owe me 400 bucks! Really?! Call it even? Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona? Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo! So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks. Hey! I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV. Ahh, to be 13 again. The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it! No! I won’t leave you! No you’re not! Not to me! What? Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from. Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too. Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed. Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or Mac. Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or C. H. E. E. S. E. That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese. Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen. I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough. You really think so? Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. There's my scene, there's my scene. Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a. Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt. C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck. Yeah, whatever. Hey. Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor! Yeah, did I fool ya? Oh, it went amazingly well! Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys. And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers. I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode! There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand. I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again! No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie. Yes! Ha-ha! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be? Hello? What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who’d you talk to? Nevermind! The allergy guy got the part! Thanks! How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around! Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine! And what?! Did you sleep with her?! What?! That’s even worse! I don’t know! But it’s the same! Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you! Name one! Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs! Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man! I was tryin’ to make a sale! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do? No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years. That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? I said name one! Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?

Hey, do we do this too much? Yeah. Come on C. H. E. E. S. E, I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU. Wow! Well then I’ll just have to carry you. Ross, you don’t have to yell. Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! Hey guys! Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?! But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on! Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator! Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot? Okay. Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! Unbelievable! He starts tugging on the guy’s ears. How do you do there, Wayne? Okay. Sorry about that. Uh, so where’s C. H. E. E. S. E? This is like the temporary robot, right? Well, II just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you. I’m sorry, it just. I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything. Hey! Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot. Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C. H. E. E. S. E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh! I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani. Wow! I’m the lead in Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E.! Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do? Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here. That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? II keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!

Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. Why should I help you?! What do you need? Yeah? What are you in love with her or something? Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know?

And the rabbi’s beard, 100 horsehair. Nice catch C. H. E. E. S. E.! It’s your line C. H. E. E. S. E.! Wayne! Wayne! Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him. Me too. Oh man! Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend! I know. It was so cool when I was up there before.

Hey Monica! This is for my boat, pretty cool huh? Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain! Chandler giving you a hard time huh? Well, you know Chandler. Maybe you changed? Maybe that’s the problem. Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife. I don’t know! I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! There are? RRRichard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?! Chandler loves marriage! You got that from what I said?! Where the hell have you been?! Richard told Monica he wants to marry her! Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off! I know! They suck! I know! Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica! Yeah! Okay. Dude-dude-dude! Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat. Hey! Phoebe! We’re both your backup?! No we weren’t! Pick me! This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel! Okay that’s fair. Yeah. Dude! She’s gone. She’s gone. She had a bag and she left. She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think. II did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me. To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would. I am so sorry man. Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here! Yeah! Yeah I’ll take that. Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over. But III can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What? You guys don’t think I look 19? Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here? I was afraid of that. ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude? So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack!

Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up! Guys! Guys! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky! Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick! All right, I’m gonna go! I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream! Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That’s so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar. The vicar? wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his. Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on? Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney? Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours. Where do you think, Zelda? Yeah I did! Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn! You got porn! Hey Rach. Hey Rach, do you smell smoke? No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire. Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins. Dude, what are you massaging an old man for? Gotcha. Hello, Zelda. The vicar! Like a goalie, right? All right, I’m sorry. Rach I. Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. Huh? IIII did?

I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff. Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there! Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. You could? Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway? What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. All right. Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho! Uh, boat rope. Uhh, rub it? I’d say, come again. No-no, wait III know this one, I know this one, uh. And deaf! Yes. I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler. Hey. I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. Women are mean! Hey. Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never! Because! You’re mean on the boat! Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean! Does a good teacher say, Put down the beer pinhead!? Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember? Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer. You won’t boss me around anymore? And you’ll be nice? And you’ll be topless? Do you want me to learn?! Ohh yeah. Nope. I don’t know why you just don’t say left. Huh? Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that? Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there. Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross! All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit! Why not?! Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit! Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me! Well, hey I did learn. Yeah!

So, what did you guys think? Mom, so what did you think? Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn’t that good. You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me! Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go. I’m gonna be on two TV shows! Oh, you weren’t finished? Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine. Wow, it’s really long. Well, these really are the days of our lives. Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives! I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother, Stryker! Well. I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there. Hey Terry! It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to. So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start? Okay. Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part. Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right? Y’know Terry, II don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot. Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? This is one star who’s hoop. This is a star that the hoop this hoop. I was Dr. Drake Remoray! Hey. Was she happy you gave her the job? Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It’s the producers over at Mac and C. H. E.

We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E! Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?! How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’! Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there. Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go. Because they wanted me to audition! Hey! Terry. Wait! Terry! Wait. Look. Wait II. Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance. Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake. I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha! Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one? Great. You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren? All right, I guess this will be fine. Nothing, why? Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude. Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money. Yeah, okay. Sure, no problem. Ooh. Hey, donuts! Okay. See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You’re changing it! All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots? Okay, first first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down, look down, keep looking down then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down, you’re looking down, keep looking down. I had a donut. Hey! Yeah! That guy’s all right! What? Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler. Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally! What?! I know, Monica told me. I don’t know Rach. One! No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back! I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me? Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women. Yeah, for you! Yeah, we look great together. Y’know, we don’t have to imagine. We’ll just see. Yep.

All right, well uh, I’d better go. Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later. No! Never! Never! Bye. Hey! What’s going on? Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations. Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part. Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges. Hi. Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before. Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had! Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had! Okay! When?! Uh-huh! I want to do it again. Why not? Fine! Do you want something to drink? Warm milk and Excedrin P. M. Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest. Why is 10 the highest? I don’t want to marry Chandler! I’ve got cold feet. No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey! Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that! Okay, Phoebe. We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, I do when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go! Yes! Excellent! Perfect score! Wow. Good speech. Yeah. And she’s back in the game. All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel. Damnit! Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. No reason, I’m just saying that uh. That’s where I’ll be. Great nap. Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! Morning! Pretty good. Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go I’m late for work. Yeah. Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship that’d be great. Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner. No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me. Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me. Fine! Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? Hey! What’s up? Hey-hey, who’s your friend? Hey! Erin! Still here! Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys. Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya. Okay, good to see you again. Bye-bye. So, system kinda broke down huh?! What?! No idea? Who do you think brought her here? Man, do you know what guys want! My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just. I don’t see it going anywhere. Look I’m sorry you guys, II just don’t think so. Hey, don’t start judging me! Huh? You’re the one who’s in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof! Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall? All right, so we should go catch our movie. I like to see the previews. The candy. Hey! Erin. What party? Who’s birthday party? Oh, and how is Allison? Yeah, look how that worked out. Hey. Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time! No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous. Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a. Okay. How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer! What about Game 1 of the Series? You shut up! I love arguing with her. I’ll be right back. Hey! You wanna go? Okay. See you guys later. Hey, thank you so much. Hey! Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70 30 but still. And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts. No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while. Where are you gettin’ this? Oh. Oh. No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! Right? No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me. Yeah? Finally! Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. Fifty-six! Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. What the hell is in there? Yeah that dog left! Don't do it! Told ya. Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream. Half hour. All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it! Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay. Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter? So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. Chandler, it's like a big gerbil. Ross, you need some help? First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up! Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here! You think? Hey. I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, SmokesALot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty. Yeah? Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left! Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it. Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried! Those two only had each other! Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park. Hey Pheebs? Hey Rach? That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn. Hey Chandler, do we know that lady? Yeah lady! Give us candy! What’s up buddy? Waiting for candy. Hey, if we know it can we have candy?! That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know. Hey. Hey!

Now I only owe you 49.50. What is Rock 'n' Roll about that? Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it? Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! Merry Christmas! Is it back in the cage? Cage closed? All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead. Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight? I’ll see you at 8:00. Hey! OhWhaHo! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note! Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex! Wow! I’m so sorry I had no idea it would bother you this much. Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself! The Ross. Is that back?! Awww! Mel Torme died. Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?! Hey. Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. II think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back. Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life. Hey! What do you got there? Huh? Uh. Oh! Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why? What?! Tonight?! After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy! Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here? Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again. Oh well, that changes everything! Y’know what Pheebs? You were right before. I mean, friends are so important. Y’know-y’know what I really want? Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up. Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli. What’s the rush? What? Whoa-whoa, what is it? A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend! No, I’m gonna! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing! Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too! Well, she graduated from high school! Fine! Fine! What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli! No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just. Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay? Hey, y’know you could always visit him. Anything I can do? Whatever you need. I can give it a shot. All right, what are we havin’? Y’know what else makes you wonder? Check out the rack on this chick! Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket? Ross! Come here, check this out! No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. Y’know, there’s two women dude. Right-right up here. I don’t know! Yeah, I do. What?! All right. Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet! Oh no! No! No! Come on! All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down. Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck. Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?! What if I smack my head on the concrete? I don’t know Ross! II tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right? No. What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg. Well all right so, it looks like we’re even! Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! Do you want soup or salad? Both! Always order both! Yeah? Really? No one’s home? Yeah! All right! Just hurry up! I think face to face. Face to face, yeah! All right. Oh my. How much do you weigh Ross?! Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through. Well, just shimmy down me and drop! Hi. Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while! It’s not that far! Just drop! Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear! Hey. What are you doing? Why would you want to do that? Rach, there is a decent place to. No. No. No. No. Rosita does not move. As in Rosita does not move. The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie. Is there a problem? I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off? She’s not even cold yet! That’s true. Yeah, I. I don’t want Stevie to see her like this. No I won’t. Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing! I don’t know why you say that so soon. Francette? What is she? A couch? Poor thing. Cut down in her prime. Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. She’s heeled! No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle! Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen! Can you tell me how this happened? Miracle! Someone like an. angel? Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! Yeah, me too. Fine. No. Really? My chair heels itself. Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! Your chair?! So, there was no miracle?! Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life. How do you figure? That’s right! Yeah! We are! Oh yeah. Ahhh. Eh? Hey! They do! Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal. Why God?! Why?! We had a deal! Let the others grow old! Not me! And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! Why are you doing this to us?! Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star. Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing? But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple. Well actually… Dude, you soooo need this car. Yep. Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys? Will you quit hoggin’ it! Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? Yeah! Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay. That’s not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal! Like what? Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home. Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list. Oh, and plus I’m 1 16th Portuguese. Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started! Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside? Okay! Yes! I don’t like this anymore. Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! All-all right! Start it up! Let’s go! No. Hey! So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and. Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma! And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain! Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure. Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months. Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart. Nice. Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist! That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that? Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are. Say what? No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani we did a scene together yesterday. II’m the guy in the coma! An-an-anyway II just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me. I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something? Oh uh, one of the writers. Umm. Okay. Ms. Monroe. Oh there you go. So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to. See you in 2003. I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show. No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much! Joey. Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please? Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much! Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again! Ever! Yeah. I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my résumé! Okay! All right! Okay. Okay. Oh well. Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented. Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb. Angelina Jolie! Like-like what? Wow! Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, Boy, she-she is a great actress! Uh but-but, I am also thinking, She is hot! You own the room. We should probably get-get uh. Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate? Yeah! Okay. Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you. Hey! That uh, that is my roommate Rachel. Sure. Yep. Okay, bye-bye. All right, here we go. Thanks for stopping by. See ya! II am so sorry. I. Oh my God! They sent me today’s script! They never send the script! Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh. Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence. Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either. I don’t think so. Oh noo. Thanks! Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?! The airport? Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone? That’s a really long time. Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again. That is. I tell ya, that is a tricky one! Good luck. I call it! Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet? Well then let me do it! No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people. No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man! Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me. So I can do it? All right! Okay! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right? Okay. Oh! My head! Oh! Oh! Hey! Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there! Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it? Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share. Eh? It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving. We too can share and love and have and receive. Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready? When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and… And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. Yes! Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember? I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything? Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, Began their beautiful journey… …by doin’ it. Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries? Yeah! I call that London style. Oh. Yeah baby! Oh. Yeah baby! Hey! Oh, dude I’m so sorry! Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! II’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bridesmaid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought? Ah. For just you? Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there. All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts. That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me. Oh… Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars! Yeah baby! No baby! And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv— Hey! Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings! What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay! This is crazy. Hey. Chandler, come on nothing even happened! No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I accept that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset. Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever. What? Really? I can do it? Hey! Well I don’t know if I remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving. Hey! So are guys doing okay? Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese! Here you go. Good for you! Food? Uh-huh gimme! This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? Oh yeah, I added three. Oh yeah… Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out? Oh uh, can I give you a hand? Boyfriend? I’m Joey. Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again? Got it! So… Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone. Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? Oh. Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I’ll grab this one. Hey Chandler! Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date. Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street! Yeah! Two days ago. Oh yeah? Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not too worried about it. Obviously! So, how do we decide? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her. Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction… Yeah well we should order some food then. That sounds fair. Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates. Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars? Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars? Hey! I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date. Yeah. What time are you meeting her? Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed. Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial? Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers. You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed! Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know! I don’t know. Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this! Well we’ll see! Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer? Kristen? Hi! Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I… Hi! Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! A woman in a man’s body. So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married? So you’ve just married the one time then? Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian? No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?! Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?! Monkey lover! When do you think we lost her? Yeah! Y’know, she could use a little… Oh nice shot! Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent… Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives! No-no. No! I’m up for a Soapie! No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie! Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards. Many are scheduled to appear. And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel… Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this. Really? What award are you practicing for? Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today, and I also get to present an award. Yeah! What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win? Yeah. No-no II know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much. Hey! You practice losing the Grammies too? Ah. Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? Whoa! Ross has a boyfriend. How’d you get over that teacher? Problem solved. This is it! This is my category. Yeah, I got my speech! Yeah. Okay. Can I squeeze your ass? ‘Kay! What the?! Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are: from Passions: Erin Goff. From One Life to Live: Mary Loren Bishop, from All My Children: Sarah McCann, and from Days of Our Lives: Jessica Ashley. And the winner is……Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight, so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel, who’s sittin’ right there! Rach, we had to get out of there because: look what I won! No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, I behalfin’ it! But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it, and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy. Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em. No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it. I can scratch that right off. All right! I’ll take it back tomorrow. If I can’t have it you can’t have it! Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman. Hey Jessica. Ah, this is my friend Rachel. Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your shelf or anything? Take it back? Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do. I’m sorry, do I know you? Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star! Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good. Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese. Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. Hello! They loved me! Oh my God! Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back. They want me to be totally naked in the movie! I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this! I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story. You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back. Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender. Hey, I’m back! Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again? Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying? Wow! Sure! That’s great! Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold. So…What? Yes! No. What? Barmitsvahed? Nope. Yep. That’s right. I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later. I knI know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like. I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. Unless what? Like what? Wow! This looks great! And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks? Thank God! Ah. Well maybe we just take that one away. Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird. Ow! Yeah. The fruit roll up. Delicious. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner! The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore! And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right? My whole family’s from Naples! Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that’s me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before. Probably Monica and Chandler. Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray! Who you what? Who you what?! Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?! What?! Hello! Hey Rach. Hey, so where are my parents gonna be? What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed! You got me. I don’t… Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’! Well-well—see? Parents are comin’! Maybe you’ll order a little sangria? We should really learn how to play the real way. Nice move. Hey! No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux. Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat. I don’t think so. Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera. Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?! Okay… Hey. It happened! Why are you taking this away from me? Oh-ho, you should get inside my head. Hey. Yeah, they’re not coming. Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted. Look Mon, if you could just call my mom… Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years. Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you? I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… Hey. Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six? Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right? Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding! Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there? Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! There is no-one better! There is no-one greater! Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second? No! No, II just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day. Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time. All right, uh… Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows? Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, Monica… …when I look back over our time together… Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together. Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here! Hey! How is Monica, I love your sweet ass, inappropriate? Has it been that long?! Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in! Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some? Okay. I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it. You?! And-and you?! How?! When?! IN LONDON! But it is a big deal! I have to tell someone! All right! Man, this is unbelievable! Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! Well I didn't tell them! Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey. And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell! No. They know you know. I couldn't even if I wanted to. Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! Ooh! I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! It's not my first time. So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows! I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership! I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are. Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! Hey. Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want. Hey! Funny one! That’s good! What? I don’t get it. I have never known love like this. If he goes first he can! Hey! Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again? Yeah, you got a couple hours? Hey! So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out? Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better. So uh, what’s your name? Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks? Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go? Pheebs! Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear? Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear! Oh. No! No wait, that’s weird! That’s weird! That’s…kinda hot. Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that. Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture! Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys. Hey! I am secure with my masculinity. You’ve seen my huge stack of porn, right? Hey Pheebs! Check it out. How much of a man am I?! Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about. The silk? Feels really good! Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be. Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear! Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about? Pantyhose! Y’know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… I should go take these off shouldn’t I? Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now. Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi! Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere? Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives. Yeah. Hm-mmm. Oh, let me get this. These are for you. No, II just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didnt get the part? No! No! Nooo! Yes! Yes, thats the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!

Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? Yeah! Me too. Im doing my scenes with you? Wow! I cant believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar! I think you did. UhCookie?

Originally, I wasnt supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. Its my best friends, and Im officiating so I really cant work past four. Im having surgery! Yeah, II just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didnt want you to worry about me. But, Im having surgery today. Transplant. Hair transplant. Its not on my head. Hey! Youre here! Great! Great! Great! Lets get going buddy, weve got a scene to shoot! Are you drunk? Yes you are! I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you! What?! He got me! Owww! Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And Im the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together? Thank you. Thank you. I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you! Hey! Did Chandler show up yet? Damnit! Im still on the set! I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this. No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now. Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power! Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered! So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day. Yeah! Youyou were wonderful. So I got your car, its right outside. Thats what you told me. No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go. Thats my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as Ive left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. Monica? Chandler? You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other? Yeah you do! Aw crap! Okayuhuh lets-lets do the rings. We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again. What? What’s going on? Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?! Ah. Slow swimmers? I can’t! II don’t have any other clothes here. I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day? That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani. Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff. Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet? Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people. Uh, eleven, eleven and a half. Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry. Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya! Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet? No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor. Hey! I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?! But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple! So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there? Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show… Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me. Well I’m not proud of this, but… Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay. Yeah. Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself. Yeah. Hey! No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill! Nothing! It was something. Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut? Hey! Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut! Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant? Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby? Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father? Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass! David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents? Okay. Okay. Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. II got something I want to say. Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Why?! Why can’t she marry me?! Oh my God. Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? Who’s the father? Ohh… I wonder if that dude. Yeah. About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… The guy left this. You opened them all? Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami. Yeah. What-what did Tag say? I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this. Listen I uh… It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me? Pheebs, give me the ring back! I understand. Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered… There you go! Oh my God! Hey! We know its Ross! I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! Well that, that sounds good. Bye. What secrets? You’ll tell me later? Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something. I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you. Why would they take away our keys? No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town. Hey, I washed those! Yeah that didn’t sound like me. Yeah, I have stuff in there too. Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. Yeah, it seemed pretty important. Really? Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is. Oh wow, I don’t feel well. Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel. I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours. What the hell is that? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing? Huh. So then I can heat this up? So it’s noticeable huh? Oh my God! I can’t believe that! How are you doing? Well, what did you say to her? What? Whoa! Hey! Whoa! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3 of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box! What?! Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment. Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys. How? I guess I could break down your door. And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? Uh, okay I’llI’llI’ll break it down. Hey! I don’t see the baby. Where is it? Hey! You’re back! A couple? Like two people? Like one, two people? Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here? Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace! You’re welcome buddy. Whom. That’s right. Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place. All right! I’ll have a sandwich! Oh I think we do. Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe. Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know. Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about. Hey. Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom? Whoa, for like months? Six months? Whoa that’s rough. The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday! Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it they’re like putty. Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story. Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe… Have a nice six more months Ross! I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying… Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go? Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it. How long since you’ve seen a girl naked? I’m not feeling it. No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot? Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong. All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right? Good luck. Yeah? That means a lot to me man. Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape! You’re right. Loud and clear! Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either. Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you. Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake. Are we watchin’ the tape or not?! I’m so happy! How do you know about that story?! Some guy! Ken Adams! Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner. I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV! No, couldn’t care less. Hey you too! What? You weren’t in it. Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash? This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel. Here we go! Here we go! Hey! Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming. Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him. I said no. What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people. I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people. Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great… Hey! No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya. It’s no Ukrainian film. I set her up with this actor on my show. No. Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years! Hey! I’m an actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island. Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash. So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books. All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough! And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date? Dude! What is going on?! Why? They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you! Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do? What do you mean? That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that! Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel? Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel. I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants. That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like? Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on! No, I said fun! Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up. No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not… That hot girl from their wedding? Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface. Hey! Yes I did! I’m Chandler. Dude, what happened? Okay. I’m Chandler. When have I ever done that?! Hey all right, Ross came as doody. Yeah. Exclusively. Catwoman, hands down. But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe. Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she? I’m not sure. Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter. I would say, Woman, please! Here comes the temper. Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler. So Ross? Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question. Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross? So you think Ross too? Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for! Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse. Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing. Rach? Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get? Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go! Or equally weak. You’re a weird lady. Hey! That’s not so bad. Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar! Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools? No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler. All right, well finish your coffee lets go. To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre not gonna be on TV! Oh, youre switching apartments? But Rachel has an apartment. She is? I guess I didnt really think about it. Hey! Oh, okay. II ate way too much. Ooh. So umm, I was talkin to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place. I was kinda hoping youd stay. No room? Its a baby. Its like this big. Yknow, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, its cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldnt even notice it. Wheres the baby? I could use a challenge! Its getting pretty easy. I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnt have to change. Yknow I blame Ross for this. Im gonna miss you, youre the hottest roommate I ever had. Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uhOh look! Heres a baby monitor, which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh? Ahhh. That-that-thats really just to show where the baby would go. Yknow why dont I hold on to him so that theres no confusion? Im loud! Im up all night! Hello! Look, if Im bringing home a woman who cant stand being around a baby, then maybe I dont want to be with that woman! Or maybe well just do it in the bathroom of the club! Yeah! All rightLook, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But, itll also be reallyreally great. Please Rachel! III really want you to stay. Ohh! I know! I found it on the street. Yeah. I dont know. Ew. Ooh! Ah! Okay! Isnt that great? Its a grand tradition! This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner! Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night. So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. Hows it going? Hot? Im gonna take that book and beat you to death with it. Will you let the lady talk?! Yeah! Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby. So you uh, nervous about getting married? Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun. How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death. Thats her! Okay, come on! Uh, that-thats-thats me! Joey Tribbiani, a big fan. Why-why would she go in the bedroom? Yeah, thats one naked hooker! Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do. Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny. I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy. Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it. Maybe she meant to get you a hooker. Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually? In a minute! All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave. Hey! Its your bachelor party. I dont want to. You do it! You do it! I miss this. No, II miss hanging out with you. Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its likethings are different. Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I justI misshanging outjust-just us, yknow? You got it. Come here. Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back. You fall for it every time! I just want you to say it once in a while. What?! Phoebe! No theyre not! Theyre ugly and stupid and delicious! She is? Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table. But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas! No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey! Thats right! Cause Im a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat! Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin chips is like stretching. Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full. Who the hell is this guy? Oh hey! Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge! Oh. How-how big is that? Its like me when I was born. Seriously, who is this guy? Im afraid Im gonna need proof. You are my Everest. Oh yes I do. Otherwise whats next? Today Im just a guy who cant finish a turkey, but tomorrow Im the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I justI justI gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give. All right wheres that turkey! Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants! Well thats it. Im done. Whew! There come the meat sweats. No just, nobody press on my stomach. Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie? Oh hey Rach, listenHi! Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren. No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, shes really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, yknow, to give her some advice. Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you! Okay, so will you meet with her? Great! Thanks! Youre gonna love her so much. AndOh, shes the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, yknow the S. A. Ts? She took em! Here she is! Future fashion superstar! My little sister Dina! This is so exciting for her. Well, Ill let you two fashists get down to business. Hey! Its my fashion girls! Whats wrong? Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich? Is that a sandwich?! What?! Well obviously this is a mistake! You cant be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant! Bub! I cant believe this! Youre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?! You got pregnant for funny?! Dinaif hes funnylaugh! All right, Ill be back in a little while! You stay here! I cant look at you right now! Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman. Dont interrupt me when Im talkin to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man. Oh youll take em! Hey! You dont get a say in this! Ahhh! I heard I do, were halfway there! Okay! You! Well what am I supposed to do? No they cant! They were stupid enough to get knocked up! Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Lets hear their plan! Now, whats the future look like for Dina and Bobby? You were right. He is funny. Dina, if youre having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, thats not a compliment! So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? Youre gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?! You cant be a single mother alone! Youre gonna ruin your life! No! No! No! Its different for you. Youre so strong and together. Youre not some dumb kid who doesnt know what shes doing. One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay. Maybe! Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant! Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister! Well Id be scared of them, but all right. Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey! Thats right! By his uncle too! Come here! Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. Im missin picture time?! Congratulations! You just got married! Hey-hey-hey, hey thats your wife youre talking about! Who was that? You hung up on the pizza place? I dont hang up on your friends. Oh, whats wrong? Then why did I ask? Is that college talk for horny? Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon. Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too. Good night. I cant do it! Youre Rachel! Youre my friend! But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad. I know! Do you wanna do it? All right, me neither! I was just testing you! This conversation never happened! Good night! Get back in there! Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out? Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm. I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant? Ooh, great! Thanks! You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya. Hey, yknow what? Why dont I take you out? Yes I do! And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out. Ill be fun. No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you. And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, its just bag. Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so. Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, sonice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman. I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy. Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking? Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh? No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on! Yknow what? Bring her both, and Ill have the same. Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? Were on a date. No! No. Umm, just myself and if they dont like me for Im sorry I couldnt even get through that. Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan. Well it does when you combine it with, This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life! Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but youre so beautifulI dont think I can. Alright, soso tell me one of your moves. Thats your move? Boy Rach, youre lucky youre hot. Queens. Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad. I dont know. I guess theres just always been this distance yknowI mean we both try to pretend its not there, but it is. Yeah, it is. Its really tough. Yknow sometimes I thinkWow! Nice move! Whered you grow up, its so simple! Yeah. Yes I am! Again so simple! Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch? Chandler? Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had! I never laughed so hardDid you see the wine come out of my nose? I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much. Huh. Huh. Ah! Okay, well then you dont judge me. Im gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible. Now you cant tell anyone, but uhI put on shiny lip balm. Yeah, like a moth to a flame, Im telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go. Why not? More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didnt say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me! Yeah. WhyYeah, that would work for ya. Oh. Yeah. Me to. Hey! Oh yeah, I still cant believe you havent seen Cujo. What is wrong with you? Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane? Oh yeah? All right, lets do it tonight. Oh right! Yeah. Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?! Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster. Yeah me too, all night. Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper. No-no! Im fine. Its just Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that youve known for a while and then suddenlysuddenly see them a different way? Yeah. Yeah, thatthats exactly it. Youre right. Yeah. Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what Im talking about. Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh. Alone?! Hey, did you get to the part where theyre trapped in the car and Cujos throwin himself at the windshield? Oh uh, it didnt work out. Oh uh, okay. Yeah. Oh sure, yeah, why not? All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay. Terrified. All right. Its a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you dont feel that now. It was crazy! Youre fine. Youre better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everythings normal! Shes just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel. Hey, its your girlfriend, Rachel! Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? II really need to talk to you. Well, neither. I dont know. Its-its justlately, Ive been feeling Okay, heres what it is You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean? It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right? Yeah. You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me. Hey. Well, whats up? What? Whaaat? Oh my God. You do? I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, its Rachel for God sakes. I know. I know. And shes not only my friend shes my pregnant friend! Shes my pregnant friend whos Ross ex! What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, yknow? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I dont like about her. You want to hear it? She made me switch to light Mayo. Thats it! Thats all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better! You think? Yeah, just a crush! Thats all this is! Its a crush! Im Joey I dont get deep feelings. Not really. Hello? Why? What are you guys doing in here? Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh! All right. Its a new day, and its just a crush, thats all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, it was cuckoo! Everythings going to be fine. Its just a crush. I love you. Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, were almost there! Were almost there! Oh, I love you too. Thats always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push! What? Whats going on? Aaaah. Really?! Oh, yknow what? Maybe uh, youyou should come to me. Im a not, Im not wearing any bottoms. Oh my, oh my God! Mia Hamm? Oh thats amazing. Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry! Hey Ross! The babys kicking! A dreamless sleep. Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel. Wow! Can I get a copy of that? Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing? Why not? I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard. Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or! I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Yknow it wouldnt kill ya to respect your wifes privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs! Oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing. Absolutely. But, were gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? Ill page Ross on the way. Come on. Okay RachRachRach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones! Hey! So? So but everything is normal. And-and theres no danger to her and the baby? Calm?! I wasnt calm! Ive never been more scared in all my life! Well what do I know?! Im not a doctor! You sure?! Oh hey-hey! Something called BraxtonHicks contractions. Hey uh, whats with the candy? Oh hey, dont worry about it man. Dont worry about it, no big deal. Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers! Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin? Then why do you throw like one? Sure. Monica. Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face. By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card? Yeah. Oh, I justI feel terrible. Whats going on? Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad. Im on it! Dude relax! It could happen to anyone. Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second? Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation. The thing iscause I live with Rachel Im here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And RossRoss is missing everything. So. Maybe you two should live together. Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems thatif youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father. All right now, so? What do you think? Well, I was due. Hey. Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, its a couple weeks past its expiration date, so its got a bit of a kick. Are you kidding me? Im great! Yeah, Im uh Im better than great. I am good. And now that shes gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnt do before. Yknow? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Yknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Yknow? I like being on my own, Im uh, better off this way. Im uh, a lone wolf. Yknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! Hey, so, uh, hows it going living over at Ross? Bye. Theres one lucky to-go cup of coffee. Thanks. But maybe later. You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentines Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that thats never going to happen! Oh, okay. No, Im not sleeping with your friend Jane again. Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane. Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun. Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, youre cute, but youre not too smart! Did I just throw this? Hi. Oh, thats, uh, thats Phoebes friends dog. I dont know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella. Cmere. Hey. Cmere. Thats Rachel. Shes the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with youwe love her. But we cant have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? Youre a guy. Well, you used to be. So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat. Hey. No. Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right! Nothing. We just talked about stuff. Rachel stuff. Hes breathing! No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look! Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog! Hey, whats up? Oh, man, Im sorry. Why? Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day. Sort of. You dont have to seem so happy about it. Oh, II d Forget about it. Its no big deal. Its nothing. Okay, uhsit down. Um theres this woman that I like. A lot. But, uhit cant happen. No! Yes. Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because I cant do anything about it. Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends. No. I dont think so. Yeah, hes the best. Oh, I dont know. I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I Oh, yeah. Its Rachel. Theres this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, its complicated.  Shes with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, yknow?  Ccause were really good friends. Yeah, hes the best. Oh, I dont know. I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I Its Rachel. Yes. Yes. I like Rachel. Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, yknow, yknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnt get said enough. I like you Ross. Yeah, but its not a big deal. Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic. Look no, II know its bad, and I know its wrong. Okay? But-but its not like anythings ever gonna happen. Yknow? These-these are just feelings, theyre gonna go away. Oh come on Ross! Hey RossRoss dont. Hey. Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it. Oh what then? Kick me? Bite me? Oh nowHey RossRoss! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something? Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I dont. Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? II would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over her, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never been in love before so. Yeah, I thought you knew that. Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I dont want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, Ah, Ill get over this. Yknow? I justIt just keeps gettin harder. I dont, I dont know what to do. Yknow? What do I do? Okay thats the green stuff talkin. But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut. Are you sure? Hey thanks. Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what I will say. What should I say? Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say? Oh! Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident. I uh, I just came by because II want to talk to you about something. Here? In the hall? What are we animals? Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner with you tonight. Thats all. Okay. Thats good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what youre gonna say. Good. Yeah. Dont you people ever knock?! What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reasonIs it hot in here? I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs. Yeah. Sure. Uh How long have we known each other? Uh-huh, long time. But over the past few weeks. Actually uh, could you give us a second? Im not quite sure. Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in love with you. Im falling in love with you. Does it really matter? Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something! But. Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I think Im gonna go. Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, cause then youre gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go! Sure! Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever! Oh no-no Rach, please, dont be sorry. Okay? Dont be sorry. Yknow I was only kidding you. Oh God! Thats Rachel! No-no, I cant! I cant! Not after the other night, its just itstoo weird, okay? Dont tell her Im here! Dont eat that! Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I dont know. Thats a pretty small hole. I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down. All right so, so what do I do? Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your. Hey. Hi. Hey! So you uh, have abig work problem? Huh. Okay. So uh, I think Im gonna take off. Yeah? Yeah? What?! Oh my-oh my God! What he wants to buy your baby?! Thats crazy! Okay, how did this even happen? Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave. Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?! Hey! Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore. Lets just say I took care of it. Dont worry! Dont worry. I just told him, very nicely, You dont go buying peoples babies, so back off! What?! Why?! And you couldnt think of anything else?! You lied to me! So? What-what-what happened? I know. I know. Hey youre right. Yeah, its kinda been like us again a little bit. Me too. I mean Ihavent thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didnt feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward. So, whos the guy? Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I cant do it with you guys watching me! Hey! Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them. And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly. I have to go to the bathroom too, but I dont want him complimenting my thing. I know. Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parkers a nice guy and Id like to get to know him. Why? What-what? I know Im having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger! I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it. Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there. Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy. Yeah. Ya know what I think I think we were all just being too negative. Actually, you have a little bit of an edge. Nothing. Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. Thats me! Im blank! Yeah you are baby. No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no. Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time. Fine! All right, Ill do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I yknow, start to say something stupid. Yeah. Oh, not at all. Happy to do it. Actually, I didnt know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldnt have mattered, Im doing this for the fans, not for the free food. And Ill have all the muffins. Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way! Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday. Yeah, I guess it is. And so Im gonna get on this spaceship, and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne babyIm gonna want to meet her. Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I doso I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray. Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. Well, there are so many things, its hard to pick just one. Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway? What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there. Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?! Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea! I think youre right. One. Thats kinda nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And Im also a mento for the kids. Yknow a mento, a role model. Right. Matter of fact, I do. Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise. Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. Yeah! Oh, II, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose! Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious. No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s! I like it. Whats not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooood. The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar? Not anymore. All right, what are we havin? Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation. Ill take those to go. For the kids. It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said. But believe me, thats not gonna happen today. Well, I said that I. You guys, this is Shelley, shes interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends. Okay. No thanks. How come you have two? Chandler: Well this one's for you. Joey: Get out. Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Chandler: That's what they'll call us. No thats all right. Dont worry about it. Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys! Yeah! Look! I know. All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food. Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

And the duck gets the NutterButter! Judge rules, NutterButter. Yeah. Id seen this thing on The Discovery Channel. Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends. Really? Me? Wow! I dont even know any huge gay people! What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! I think face to face. Face to face, yeah! All right. Oh my How much do you weigh Ross?! Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think we thought it all the way through. Hey Pheebs! Check it out. How much of a man am I?! No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean. Its not what you said. Its the way you said it Oh My God, Im a woman! Great nap. Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, Hey, how you doin? Hey, how you doin? Hey! How you doin? Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? Hey, how you doin? Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on. Oh, I do. How you doin? What?!?! Oh dear God! Not much to tell there Im really shy. Oh great! Great! Thank you. Bye-bye. I did it! Oh, I dont watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, yknow? Oh, good to know. So close! Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that. Little bit, yeah. Oh yeah, thats just a little something for my huge gay fan base. Oh no, I cant go. Im practicing I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.

Why dont you tell us a little something about you Ross? I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler? Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first. What is the capital of Columbia? Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card. I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower. This is embarrassing. All right Ross youre in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem? Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath. No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question. Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, TrisHoly cow, thats a big word. Trisc Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that? This one right here. No! No, fear of the number 13. All right Chandler, youre up. All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card. You-you must choose Mr. Bing. Choose, you jackass! Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points! In what John Houston film would you hear this line, Badges? We dont need no stinkin badges! Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus! Yes! Wise choice, how many rungs? That noise can only me one thing. Okay, its an audio question, name this television theme song. Yes! Yes, youre back in the lead! All right! All right! Uh, umm, SuperSpeedy Speed round! Of course! Who invented bifocals? Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest? Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus! Now, over to Chandler. Are you sure? Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been Bamboozled! Its a pleasure to meet you Ray. RightieO Ray! Hello, Im Joey Tribbiani! Lets play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One? Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem? WhatWhy?! Well whats complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey you yank his tail and boom! Youre in Paradise Pond! Well whats fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game thats just people standing around answering questions? Lets play Bamboozled! Man, this is bad! And Ive had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal. Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And Im not just saying this because Im your friend, Im sayin it cause its the truth. Youre food is abysmal! Hey uh Monica, I cant remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies? Okay, Ill see you there. Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya. What uhHow come youre not going? I thought you already have a job. Wow! How do you know how to do that?! What is it? You cooked him? Either eat it, or be in it. Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here theres a new class comin in. Hi. When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack? Cheese makes me thirsty. All right. I can an A? In-in school? Hey, Im a dork. Yeah! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont want to go. Im having fun. Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go. Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, and I didnt have to sleep with the teacher this time. What the hell! Oh, its a poster for that World War I movie that Im in, check it out. Uh-huh! I know. Im coming soon to a theater near you! Im in THX! Im unsuitable for children! Yeah, yeah, its already generating Oscar buzz. I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and youre all invited! Sure! Why not?! Hello? One guest? You told me I can have six tickets! Oh my God. So thats it?! I only get to bring one guest? Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross. You said you didnt want to go. Definitely not invisible. Well uhI think I want to take Chandler. Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back. Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself. Thanks. That means a lot to me. Im gonna go shave. A little tall. Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go. I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along. Okay, this is it. Its my big fight scene coming up. You liked it? You really liked it? Which part exactly? Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part? You fell asleep! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later. Hey! Sleeping beauty! Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep? Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you? Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything! Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those? Okay, five hundred dollars. What else? Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats. Please! All right, what else? Which were still keeping under our hats! What the hell are you talking about, The south will rise again man. Yeah.

My boys all grown up! What?! Are you crazy?! God. Hes crazy! Why doesnt he want to be with Rachel? I mean seriously, shes like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadnt and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and I havent bummed you guys out like this in a while have I? Come on you stupid machine! Come on! No. All right. Hey I got one! I got one! Uh, you gotta press the button. Uh, shes with me. Dr. Drake Remoray. Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information Im a doctor. Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head? Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years! 816, thank you! And what is his name? Great! Go get him. Hes not really my type. But you said he was this great guy! You do attract some stinkers. Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you. I know, but Im a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me. That was a test. Good response. All right, full name. Date of birth? Age? Im a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician. Okay. And uh, are you married. Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues? Yes. Oh thats terrible. ImIm really sorry. Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again? Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually? Oooh, wrong answer. Uh, well hes 33. A widower. He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and hes not into anything weird sexually. Rachels having her baby! Which is of no interest to me, Im a neurologist. Fake? Excuse me? Hello? Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brothers triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn! Right! Me neither. There she is! She looks so real! Yknow what I mean! Shes this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees anduh-oh. Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so were good. Whats the matter now? What was the other one Ross? Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time it is like a freak show up here. Whats the matter? What is it? Hey! Rach come on, what? What are you talking about alone? What about Ross? Okay, how long was I watching that woman? Yeah, I guess so. Hey, listen to me, listen to meyou are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise thats not gonna happen. You dont have to worry about that okay? Sure. My God. Uh Look Rach Hey Ross is here! Hey look! Its my good friend Ross. Hey Ross. Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but Im really more of a candy guy. No. Oh, Im sorry. I meant no. Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you. Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second? Dude I just did something terrible. No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me! Because it kinda looked like I did. Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand. It wasnt my ring! It fell out of Rosss jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing! I guess. I know! I know its awful. She said yes. Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him? Oh, I like that. Yeah. Now lets not get carried away. Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? IllIll come back later. It cant be me, Im standing right here. Were not peeking? Hey uh, is it okay to come in? Yeah uh look Rach, theres something I gotta tell ya. Yowsa! Dear Lord. Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that. Yknow, I dont really know her. Are you kidding me?! I dont know! Maybe shes crazy! No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out. I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it. Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I dont want to hurt her. Youre right. Youre right. IIll go tell her now before Ross finds out and Ill be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out. I can come back. No. Actually, technically, I didnt. No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me! No, I didnt! No, I didnt! Ahhh! Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didntI didnt propose! Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing. No, I didnt! No, I didnt! Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out! Ill tell you about it later. Be cool. It wasnt my ring! Its Rosss ring! Thats why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose. Well, this is awkward. See? I told you so. Dude, step up! I proposed. Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier. I cant believe youre not going to propose! Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down! Ah, its beautiful. Yknow what you guys? Im uh, Im gonna go too. And uh, Im sorry about everything. No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just thatMan! That kid is going to town! Hey you guys Im gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye. This isnt the right room, sorry folks. Whyre you so tired? You know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself that little story. Hey so wheres Ross? Is he still mad at us? Thats not fair! I cant do that. See this is what I was afraid of, I didnt think I should be here either but somebody said hed be over it by now. Hey. Ross, I know youre pissed at me, but we have to talk about this. Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didnt even do anything wrong. I said I didnt technically. Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I dont really know what that means. You were saying? I know I shouldve. Im sorry. No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this. No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry! You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me. Why not?  Youll feel better!  Ill feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes. A little bit. Little bit. A little bit more. No, hit me. Hit me. Hit me! Hit me, hit me. Hit me! Hit me! Im sorry! It was a reflex! I couldnt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! You were supposed to duck! Why didnt you duck? Good, good yeah, maybe while were there, they can check your reflexes. Oops. Hey, so how is it? Your thumb? Thats weird. You sure youre punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible. You, you want me to help you with that? Name? I know Ross but whats it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher. Its pretty, Okay date of birth? Sure, May tember. Occupation? Dinosaurs. Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact? Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while. Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, youre gonna get together right? But you two were supposed to be together. Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody. So? Wow. Really? And youre Okay with that? Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youll ever be just anybody. Thanks. You know, ah, Ive been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, its not my fault. Its a natural instinct. Thursday? But that's Halloween. So spooky, that's all. I know. What about me, huh? Only had one lunch today. No, they're coming, we're waiting right here. Maybe we should just eat now. Well, how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, OK, what's the restaurant's policy about people eating that? But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom. If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell ahhh! Thank you. Waiter! All right, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up. Risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden? and a Bordelaise sauce, unless any of that stuff I just said means snails. Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request? Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care. That's a great story. Can I eat it? Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman. Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach. And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because. Son of a bitch! Why are you going? He said she wanted the shrew! No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want. Chandler, control your woman! Well, what is going on with you two? So? You had sex, right? See ya. Well, this is just us. Do, you gonna go do it now? No, no. Monica and Chandler leave, the waiter comes. Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, huh. You boys are about to see something really special. Excellent. The shrew in particular was exquisite. Joey! Joey. This is the best birthday ever. Aaahhh, look at you two, holding hands, huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet?

I'm not so good with remembering lines. I know, right? Wh. Wh. Why are we doing this? Seriously? She actually said that? Nooooo! Being funny is your thing! Without that, you just got lame with women. Fire trucks! Hey! Really? Guys do that? That's, weird. That's like a woman wanting to be a. Uhm. A penis model. Anyway, hey. Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met? Really? Do you not know Chandler? So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing. You know, like Ross's thing is. No. Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like. Heeeyy! Hey! Yeah. Not knowing when to shut up. Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out!

What? Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape. Hey dude, what's up? Did you take that tape? I don't know. Who'm I'm married to? She hot? How did she get me to settle down? Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being. What? Whoo. What? All right, fine. But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to. Well it's okay, its like, its just a football game. Yeah, see, you were all worried for nothing. You don't wanna see what I just saw! at this moment Monica comes. Monica, look. I don't think you and I have any secrets. wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap. TV announcer: Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK. Oh my God! Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves. I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani. Like, like I was some kind of idiot. Yeah. Opening Credits Ross and Rachels Apartment Ross and Rachel are putting baby stuff together like they're going to be. Hey happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs! I. I. I need a good lie.

Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs, I still need some help here. Oh. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? I can't believe I won. Uh, who has to die for me to get her? Everyone is looking around and at Joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces Commercial Break. Yeah he's lying. He looked down. I lie better then that, right? The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me. And they all got to meet Santa! Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency. Oh. My sister's raccoon. Arg. Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door. Setting the table. ooh oooh. What?

Okay, what have we always wanted to do together? No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the WizzardsKnicks game, courtside! Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee. Hey! How come the door's locked? Hey! Open the door. What's going on? What are you. Why are you dressed like that? Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before. Okay. Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out? Dude, come home! COME. HOME. I don't know how to tell you this but, uh. I think Monica's cheatin' on ya. I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you. All right look. If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna. I just heard him! No. All right, I'm going in. I heard him again! Okay. Great. I'll see you when you get here. I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out. Absolutely. You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied. Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight. All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah! Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows. Why do I smell men's cologne? Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier. I guess not. Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here? What's going on? What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, Duh. Yeah? Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head. All right. Thanks. Here's your ticket. Thanks man. Where are you going? Wow, that was great! You really wrote that? I love my job. Rach, these are for you. No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. Uh-huh. And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. They're ribbed for your pleasure. Thank you! Okay. Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian? If you want I could loan you some money? Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show? Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think. No it is awesome! She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head? Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene? Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back. Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight. Hey. Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word puppy. Okay, so he said: If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass. That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray. No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die! Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job. Okay. Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay. Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress. Nice. No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight. He slept with you and then never called you. Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here! Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her. Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald? Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables? You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it. What? Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy. Hey. So where's Mon? And you're not helping? You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes. Yeah, you too. How do you think she's doing? Man, I wish I had a nanny like you. Sure. Why not? So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right. Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more! Yes! Fine. For a walk. Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts. Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her! Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like, like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy. Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there? Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. Fine, mediocre porn. Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now? Oh. Happy birth, oh, see you later. So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work. Oh, I didn't go to college. Molly, people don't study acting. Will the stable boy never get the princess? No, the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again. Ok. It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I. On? Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out! Oh man! I have to get those done too?! Hey hey! You dye your hair! Arghhh! Double standards! Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment. Chandler Bing. OK Thanks. Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here? Oh good. All right let's just do this. Please I have an extremely high threshold. Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face! I'm all right! I'm all right! Hey, I need your help. Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped. You may be a sissy but I'll still. All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one. All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so. What the hell am I supposed to do! What, what. Oh my God! Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore. Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around. Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing! Thank you so much. Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it. Comb my eyelashes. Hey! Ha, oh, of course. Your eyebrows look weird. Morning, roomie! Fifth day's a charm. Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night? She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night. No, hey, it's been great. Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump. Wow! So, how are you? Really? Well, actually it. Wow, really? Sure, I know lots of girls. Ooh, names? Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something? I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody. Why are they doing this? You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here? I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed. Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids someone's gotta carry on the family name. Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down she's still in the bedroom. I know that just pushes them further and further apart. Ooh, that's a great plan! Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh. Hey. All right! Who is he? She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies. And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles? Oh my god, you're right! She even reads for pleasure! What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? I met her at the library. I went in to pee. Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else. Ooh. I hear that's bad. Ah, yes, The Plan! Yeah, you know, it's not that fun. Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together. Hello? Emma? Hey! Hi! How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed? You can't have SEX, when you're taking care of the BABIE! Because you two were having sex! Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once? Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. Hey, I gotta! Unless. Unless you name your firstborn child Joey. Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name. You almost had me. Uh-huh. It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex. We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding. Where? Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?! Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. Hey! Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day, and I smelled bacon. Who did? She did? I did? I don't know, but it sounds great. With Lennart Haze? Oh my god, that is great! That is for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time. Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. Yeah, yeah, and directing. Yeah, he's done some amazing works. I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. Don't make me more nervous than I already am! It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work. Tell me about it! Unlimited nights and weekends! No, III wasn't making fun of you, honestly, II think you were great in those commercials. Yeah. Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon… Wow! Oh, yah, sure. Err, I think you know. I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now. I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't. Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a… Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern I could go right now, maaan! Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. Yeah. I really doubt that. Couldn't I just sleep with the producer? Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less. Wooow It's like they're on fire! I give you 500 for them! Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom? But I'm bursting with u-hu! Actually, I really need… Yes… ahahaaa. I think you know! I am what you made me! You know what? I could go right now. I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't! I did? Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. Hey! Probably wanna know what I'm doing…? Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! We gotta get more of that. I need an answer! You know! I need an answer now! Oh! You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene! Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get… Hey! I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good. But wrong. Aww, I don't know Monica y'know, erm, lending friends money is always a mistake. And I think he would tell you it was a mistake. Oh how much? Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!? That's right I am! Oo what's in the bag? Oh baby-proofing. Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like. Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs! or er. Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again! Huh! You're gonna do it? Oh, women can. You can't. The hardware store is right down the street. Hey! I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica. Yeah, I know. Err. I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad. That's the fastest I have ever thought! Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars? Err. Well I. Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. I am on fire! Err. Kind of. Oh no no no no no. It wasn't. It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her. Something personal. Boob job. Well it's. It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy. Rach?! Rachel!? So I can't do anything I like? Because she is! Mmmm hmm! For your boob job! OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger? Hey uh, where do you guys want this? Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh? Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that! Hey! No, no, no, what do, you can't do that to him! Dude! aaand SEND! Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye! Chandler, hey. Rach, what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? Oh, yeah, of course, yeah, it's a stuffed animal, you know, it's for kids, not for adults. I know that! Rachel, let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount. Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person! Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel, with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy. Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy. There you go sweetie. This isn't over. Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend. No, no, it's not a girl, it's, a brand new Hugsy! No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back. Make the transfer! Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago. But he's the same. But he's the same. He's the same! You're not the same! Original or crappy? No, sorry haven't seen him. It's Monica, ok? Alright! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.  she's being unreasonable! It does? Really? She, she loves me? Ok, wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if. If Hugsy means that much to Emma then, well she can have him. Look forget it forget it. I can't do it. How do you think I got him in the first place? Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche? Alright! A place to entertain my lady friends. A place to eat spaghetti. Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so. Yeah Connecticut. Not West Virginia. Uh! Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this? I like those odds! What's that now? Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!? I was? I did? Oh yeah! The casserole lady. Ooh! Tough odds! Look who's coming around! Did you get it? By you!? I'll do it! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine. I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else you know won't come true! Can't really say! I'm not really comfortable with these questions! I won, hey! Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks! Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward. You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks? I can't believe you're taking this away from me! Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right? I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those? I'll show you how. Yeah, I want my tickets too! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah! Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! Oh! No, no! Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. And what did she say? Damnit! anybody got anything? Hey, that is so great about the job. And I like to think I had a little something to do with it. Well, before, with the wishbone. I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job. Oh yeah. Me too. Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won. God, you're beautiful, why are we fighting this? You know you want it to happen as much as I do. I want you. I need you. Let me make love to you. Oh, ehm. I'm. I'm rehearsing my lines. They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good! Yeah, that was a disappointment. Oh, hey! D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok? Yeah! Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again. Right! Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor? I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes! Also so gay! Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff! Oh, wish me luck! Rach, I gotta say, if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this! Hey! Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and, and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me! Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me? Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. Right, ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. What? Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that! but, but. Hey! Oh man! I thought I got it all! I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender, and I thought, well, how important can that be, right? Turns out very! What? Oh. I don't think it's going very well. Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow. A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. So. I've never played that! Uh, well, just once, with you. What the hell are you talking about? Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up, and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't. And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Well, hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her, you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she, is, beautiful, and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Thanks dude! This is GREAT! Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night? Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play. It's a one-woman play called Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life. You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise! I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want. Hey, here you go. Hey! What's happenin'? Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first. Stupid Jane Rogers! Kinda have a, a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. I do it every year. I didn't have to tell you that! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers! Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe you guys went for that one! You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people! Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one! Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8. Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun. What party? Ok. I mean. Nice to meet ya! Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming. Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright, go, go get yourself a drink or something. Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. It's a science. Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or. Monica! What have you got there? Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty? Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug. This guy's Canadian. And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000 to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass. Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Me. Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Gotcha. Hey! Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious. That's not how she used it? Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close? Who says that wine has to cost more than milk! Heeey! Come on in, how are ya? Can I offer you a drink? Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh! Hey, if you need a tour guide. Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first? Ok! I know, yeah! Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees. Which one, they all suck! I don't think so. Ross! I need to talk to you about Charlie. Yeah, I'm. I'm kind of having a little problem. No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo. Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid! EH, what do you know! Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out! Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her. Thanks. The Metsss! Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion! Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET. Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok? You got to tell me exactly what to do there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right. Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself. No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks! Phonetically? Ok. Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on Days I had to say Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy. No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means you're gonna get eaten by a bear. Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! Come on! you. Hey! You're ready? Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up. Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but. I made it work. So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good. Oh hey Rach! Maybe you could take Charlie shopping. Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes. Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes, and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY! What's the matter, Pheebs? Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? Alright, have a good time. Just, seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist, it's fun, yeah! Bye. All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic? So you're ruling out surrogacy? So, I don't have to learn what that means? Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs? Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it! Hello? No. no, eh, she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up? Oh! How's it going? What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda! Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.! Ross, you have to get that job! Well, just wake him up! Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and, no wait a minute, it was me who fell asleep. Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!? Wow! You look, stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness! Then don't go! Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk! Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go! Mmh-mmh. Barbados! All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally. I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time! That, never happens. No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called The Days of Our Lives. Ok, Ross! It's. It's fun, yeah! No, II play Doctor Drake Ramoray. You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at? Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright! Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong? You really should have been more clear about that! Hey! Oh! ah! eh. Britney Spears!? You could say: Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears? Wha? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out? Will you wear a thong? Oh, you got yourself a very weird deal! Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming. No, why? Oh man! I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here! Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous! Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in. Hey guys! Damnit! Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot? It's really gone? I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions. Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can. Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a Galaxy far, far away?. I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we, we can't do anything. Hey, it hasn't come to that yet. Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do! Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention? I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and. Eva Trorro, womba. Kate Miller it is. In that case should I make sure it's on real good? Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun. Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like? But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like? There it is, you're blushing! You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? Tell me who it is. Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who? What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get? Yeah, who is that? Yeah. Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech? Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who. Yeah. Night. He said erectus! No, he really said it. Erectus? Yeah, and so funny! Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! Oh, oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it. I'll do it alone, but. I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you. Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech. Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun! Yeah! A little bit, yeah. Yeah. I think we do, about what? Hey. Uh. Charlie and I broke up. Oh well, she said we have nothing in common. No, it's not, we have nothing in common! I mean, she should be with someone like. Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull! Ok, Rach! I feel so stupid, you know? Why, why do I keep going after the wrong girls? Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like. What the hell is my problem? OH! I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me! But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about? Ok! All right, well. I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll. I'll see you later! You like me? That's a huge thing! What, for how long? A MONTH? I just have one question! What the hell are you doin'? Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as, as. George! CURIOUS GEORGE! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat! Yeah, he had a paper route. No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no, this, this can't happen! NO, NO! It can't happen at all! Because, look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross! I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right. I'm sorry.! NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li, hey, like you said: no big deal! NO BIG DEAL! Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah! Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie. Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do? No idea what it means. I don't believe this. Have you guys been. Is he gone? Pssst. Well, he's with Charlie now. You're a pain in my ass, Geller! Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should, hold off until we talk to Ross. Yeah, I think that'd be best. So, so I'm gonna. I'm gonna take off. I like although! Six years? Wow. It's almost as long as highschool. Absolutely! He's not thinking about you. I'm thinking about you. Let's forget about Ross. What's wrong? Well, maybe I can help. Yeah, we really need to talk to Ross. Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm, kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up. Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie? I understand. I guess so. I'm just, really nervous. Ooh. I'm gonna get the lasagna. Hey! Yeah? You kissed. I saw you. Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay. It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And. I want you to be happy. Yeah. Now I have something. Oh, uh, look, before you. I am those things, yeah. Dude! I can't think of anything. Yeah. I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler. Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that. Hey! So, did you err, did you tell Ross? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go. I didn't mean it. I'm so so-ooory. Alright, alright, okay, uhm. How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow, tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together. I know, I know, but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals. Yeah! Good night! Good night! Stop saying good night. Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but. Let me explain, okay? Rach, he just saw us. But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss. Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but. Yeah, but it did happen, so. Ross? No, no, no! Probably. No, no! Really? Ross. Look, don't you think that will be a little weird? I do like fajitas. Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date. I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home. In a carriage! Hey, Charlie! So, did you bring a little something for Ross? Oh. Oh, thanks. Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out. Uh, actually, that's. Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink. Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready? Dude, are you okay? You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay. Yeah. I'll see you in the morning. It doesn't look good, does it? Morning. Here you go. Yeah. No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen. Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly. It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're. You're Ross and Rachel. That's what I hear, yeah. Come on, I mean, you know me, you know. I'm crazy about her. I think so. Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it. No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this? And we're okay? Yeah. It's actually our first official date. Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at. It's OK! Well, I. I know exactly what I'm gonna do! No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different. You have to appreciate their uniqueness. No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh. NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. More foosball? I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won’t be going back there! Yeah. Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch? What’s the matter? I don’t get it, Chandler loved it! Ok. Uh, was that good for you? Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier? Ok, yeah, got it. This thing welded shut?! All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing. Sorry! I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra! Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping! NAH! I don't have another level! Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second. Hey! Yes ma'am, ready to Power through! Uh! Ok, you're scaring me a little bit. Oh! yeah! uh uh! No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters! Soldier down! Well, I know what's the matter with me. I don't know. Yeah, was there a part of you that, felt like it was, really wrong? Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit. Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we, do it. That's a, pla-an. Wow. I did not see this coming. I guess they weren't as good friends as we are. So. I love ya. Yeah, me too. Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while. Come on robot! Way to go robot! Hey, good race you guys. Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME! I've been here the whole time! Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time! No! No, and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can! UUUm, I think there's been an oversight. Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey! I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one. Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start. Dear baby adoption decider people. Hey! Uhm. Aren't you a little overdressed? That's right, yeah. Always nice to meet a fan! I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated. Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but. I don't know any big words or anything, so. What did I just say? Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart! No, no, I'm. brainy, bright, clever, I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package! Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya? Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus! Yep! Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude. Why not? Ah, look who’s back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS? What? You slept out here? But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her. Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said Uoh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips! I don’t need that kind of talk in my house! 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone? Yeah, Monica made us! Yeaah. I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT! Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency. Yeah. No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani. Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter. No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now. Okay, bye bye. She was nice! Whoo-hoo! She has a lot of crap! Well, hey! Well. Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and. I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike! Hi sweetie! No. Cool! That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it? What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold! Huh? Come on! What can't I do? I can do that! Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or, professing. I like to use. Oh, what's the product? I'm cold! Oh! Any word on casting yet? What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses! Thank you. Damn it! Just pass it to your boss! What's up? Oh. But, ehm, you watched the tape? You didn't watch the tape. Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? Well, you lied again! Keep going Pinocchio! No you didn't! You still here? Ok whoah-hey. Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about, lying. Stop lying! You wanna know wh? You wanna know why? Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. What? I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price. But it's an original Buffay. Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!? GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE! That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied. Now, what do you say? And?. AND? Gladys? You're mean! Hey! What's going on? Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you, get a baby? Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity. Celebrity. Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is! Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW! Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe. Guys!? What's going on? Everything doesn't sound fine! Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble. But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger! We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger. I did not care for that! Ok, ok! I forgot my bat. Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert! Uhm, ok, uhm. Well, yeah. You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me. Oh, yeah. Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it, lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me. No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of, social work, ok, that you can just, do. Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you? No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies, ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? NO!

If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner. I don't know. Okay. How late are we? Wow. Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand! You are not at Thanksgiving? We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time. Yeah, where were you! Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before. Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit! All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae. No. Here. Who do you think its from? I hate that thing, it's like a, bolt of lightning. Ah-haah! I win! That's fire. Beats everything. Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played. I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. WATER BALLOON! Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us. I'm telling ya. I can do it. Oh!

Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family, and instead, you disrespect me. I cannot allow this. More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal. I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her. That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. That was ME! I'm glad we had this little talk. How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? Hey, what are you guys gonna do? The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. I don't think they are. Yeah according to the news, most of the city did. Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl. Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding. Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh. I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but, yeah we do. Friends, family, dog. Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place, so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here, when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings? Okay. Yeah? Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband? Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife? I now pronounce you, husband and wife. It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage? Nice.

No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here. Hey, hey. I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that thing. What is it? I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus. Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it. Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason. Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner! Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter. FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmm. no, hmmmmm, it's not, hmmmm. Ow! Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you? Oh. I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening. Uhm, oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted! Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea. Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean? What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends. Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways. Yeah, yeah, I guess. Yeah, maybe. I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart? Just when I thought we could be friends. Hey! Oh, just er, you know, looking around. But you know what? This house, is great. Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing. What? That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts! What? I get my own room? Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing? Why not? I'll keep the tank clean. I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but, am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies? Hey, great! All right! What? No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no. No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations!, and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs. Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it. No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA. Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. Hey Phoebe. I'm just mad at my agent. There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason. Ok. Why? I love that saying! Hello? I was just gonna call you! That's weird. Yeah, actually I am! That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball. No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it. I'm saying that…. This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her. I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again. Why? You blow me away. I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. Oh my God. Hello? Estelle? Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me? No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by! Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there? Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. out of area. Boy, I'll say. Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman....inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris. Just flip! Damnit! Hey! Try it, I can't feel a thing! You guys hear a ringing? Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya! Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard! Hey. Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second. Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok? What did I just say? Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute. I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning! Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching. I really made you think about that thing uh? Lucky bastard! All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh, did you do anything to make her mad? I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am. Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. Who's that dirty old lady? Come on here, have a seat. Chandler, wait, wait, wait. If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger. A little more. A little more, a little more. A little more. All right. Okay, all right, let's do this. Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot. Hey! It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler. Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr. Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to. Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there. Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now! Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you. Oh my God. You and Rachel? So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together? So, so is she still going to Paris? Okay. I bet you did! Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck? Oh my God! What did you say? You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do? Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language. Hey! Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight? Ross, wait! Could you get me a muffin? Hey, you know what might help? It's a. It's a welcome home sign for the baby. No, I sat in the paint. Why not? Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes. Damn it! You know, the baby can't read, Mike! Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise. Hey, so what is the big surprise? Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they? Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica. Hey, maybe that's for the best. Yeah. You know? You just. Look, you gotta. You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye? Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents. Right? Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her. What? Really? Yeah, you are! This is so cool! But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say? Good luck, good luck! Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now? Alright! Ah. Chick Jr? Duck Jr? Don't hide from mama! Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack. Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck! Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone! Oh! You stepped on my egg roll? Just put it on a plate and leave. Alright. Wait, wait. Do you hear that? Oh! They're in the table! We gotta get them out of there! Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls? Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little. Oh! Oh God! So what do we do? Okay. Does that mean we have to bust it open? Oh my God! All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life my time-machine. It did not. Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there. Okay. Here goes. I need to say goodbye to the table first. Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel. All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything? Okay, here we go. I can't do it. Yeah, they're stuck inside the table! Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it! Yeah. Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go. Yeah. I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again. What? I could get a goose! Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit. Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah. Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat? I love you! Hey! So did you guys make it in time? Has it always been purple? Yeah. I guess so.
