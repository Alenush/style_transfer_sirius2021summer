PHOTOGRAPHER: Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film. 
MONICA: Okay. 
ROSS: Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you! 
JOEY: What? What’s going on? 
ROSS: Monica’s pregnant! 
JOEY: Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?! 
MONICA: Guys! I’m not pregnant. 
JOEY: Ah. Slow swimmers? 
ROSS: What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant? 
MONICA: You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?! 
ROSS: No! I’ll be right back. 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier. 
MONICA: Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party. 
JOEY: I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here. 
MONICA: Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant? 
MONICA: Because I’m not. 
PHOEBE: We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant——It’s because I am. 
CHANDLER: What?! What are you talking about? 
MONICA: What are you talking about? 
PHOEBE: Yes, I…I am with child. And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder. 
MONICA: Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?! 
CHANDLER: Who’s the father? 
MONICA: Yeah! 
PHOEBE: I can’t say. 
MONICA: Why?! 
CHANDLER: Why not? 
PHOEBE: I can’t say because he’s famous. 
RACHEL: Oh my God, who is it?! 
MONICA: Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us. 
PHOEBE: Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. 
CHANDLER: As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin? 
PHOEBE: What?! Well he never said that to me! 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids. 
PHOEBE: How about just the bridemaids? 
CHANDLER: Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal. 
PHOEBE: It is. 
RACHEL: For you. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! 
RACHEL: Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet. 
PHOEBE: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant. 
RACHEL: You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you. 
PHOEBE: Sneaky. 
RACHEL: Oh yeah. 
PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile ladies. 
RACHEL: Oh! Oh by the way? 
PHOEBE: Uh-hmm. 
RACHEL: James Brolin? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay. 
RACHEL: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay. 
PHOEBE: Really?! 
BANDLEADER: Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing! 
CHANDLER: Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya. 
MONICA: Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket! 
CHANDLER: No? 
MONICA: No. 
CHANDLER: I’ve been taking dancing lessons. 
MONICA: What?! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget. 
MONICA: Oh that is so sweet! 
CHANDLER: So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife? 
MONICA: Yes. 
MONICA: What’s the matter? 
CHANDLER: I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery. 
MONICA: Well, are you going to be able to do this? 
CHANDLER: Not well. 
MONICA: Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us. 
PHOEBE: So, are you ready to talk about it? 
RACHEL: No. 
PHOEBE: Now? 
RACHEL: No! 
PHOEBE: Okay, we’ll talk about something else then. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
PHOEBE: Who’s the father?! 
RACHEL: Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag? 
RACHEL: Phoebe!! 
PHOEBE: Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey! 
RACHEL: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him. 
PHOEBE: Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him. 
MONICA: Oh sweet Lord. 
JOEY: I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day? 
MONICA: Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey! 
ROSS: Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother. 
WOMAN: Oh hi, I’m, I’m Mona from her restaurant. 
ROSS: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name. 
MONA: You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it. 
ROSS: Aw come on, Mona Lisa? 
MONA: Uh-huh. 
ROSS: Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world. 
MONA: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her. 
ROSS: Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too. 
MONA: Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name. 
ROSS: Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken. 
JOEY: That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. 
MRS. BING: Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d like you to meet Dennis Phillips. 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Congratulations. 
CHANDLER: Thank you. 
MRS. BING: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover. 
CHANDLER: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so. 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Oh, I’m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions. 
MRS. BING: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show. 
JOEY: I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani. 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Dennis Phillips 
JOEY: Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff. 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Oh, thank you. Well if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. 
JOEY: Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet? 
MRS. BING: Well, it’s a funny story. 
CHANDLER: Funny: ha-ha or funny: 
BANDLEADER: Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served. 
ROSS: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six. 
MONA: No, nine. 
ROSS: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… Hello. 
JOEY: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people. 
CHANDLER: What size shoes do you wear? 
JOEY: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half. 
CHANDLER: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume? 
JOEY: Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry. 
CHANDLER: Those aren’t eleven and a half. 
JOEY: Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya! 
MONICA: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?! 
RACHEL: Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now? 
MONICA: This is so huge. 
RACHEL: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding? 
MONICA: Of course not nothing is. Between me and you… 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
MONICA: …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant? 
RACHEL: Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through! 
MONICA: How? 
RACHEL: I don’t know! Maybe they have tools. 
MONICA: Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own. 
RACHEL: Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave. 
MONICA: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be. 
RACHEL: Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well. 
MONICA: Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years? 
RACHEL: I don’t know. 
MONICA: Are you okay? 
RACHEL: Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe. 
WAITER: Champagne? 
RACHEL: Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it. 
PHOEBE: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin… 
MONICA: Oh really?! 
PHOEBE: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said… 
MONICA: Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant. 
PHOEBE: What?! Why bother? 
MONICA: How do you feel? 
RACHEL: I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!! 
PHOEBE: Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant. 
RACHEL: What?! 
PHOEBE: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure. 
MONICA: Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right? 
RACHEL: How many ways are there to do that? 
PHOEBE: I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure. 
RACHEL: All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home. 
MONICA: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me. 
RACHEL: Okay. Thank you. 
MONICA: Okay. 
PHOEBE: I’ll run out and get you one. 
RACHEL: Oh, you guys are so great. 
MONICA: Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?! 
PHOEBE: Oh no, she won’t tell us. 
MONICA: Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present. 
RACHEL: Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick. 
PHOEBE: See? This is why you register. 
ROSS: It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… Hi. 
MONA: Hi! 
ROSS: Umm, would you like to dance? 
MONA: Sure. 
ROSS: Yeah? 
MONA: Yeah. 
ROSS: Oh great! 
LITTLE GIRL: Dr. Geller? 
ROSS: I wasn’t farting! Uh, a little game from our table. Yes? 
LITTLE GIRL: Dr. Geller, will you dance with me? 
ROSS: Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady. 
LITTLE GIRL: Okay. 
MONA: Ohhhh! 
ROSS: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first. 
MONA: I’d be happy to. You are very sweet. 
ROSS: Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet. 
LITTLE GIRL: Sure! 
ROSS: Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking? 
LITTLE GIRL: Uh-huh. 
ROSS: Keep dancing. 
CHANDLER: And the world will never know. 
JOEY: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet? 
CHANDLER: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives. 
JOEY: No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor. 
CHANDLER: But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet. 
JOEY: Hey! 
LITTLE GIRL: Thank you. 
ROSS: No-no, thank you Miranda. 
LITTLE GIRL: Melinda! 
ROSS: All right. 
MONA: How cute was that? 
ROSS: Oh-oh, were you, were you watching? 
SECOND GIRL: Can I go next? 
ROSS: What? Of course you can! Hop on! 
MONA: Okay, but I get to hop on after her. 
ROSS: I am so gonna score. 
SECOND GIRL: What? 
ROSS: I like your bow. 
JOEY: I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple! 
BANDLEADER: Thank you. 
ROSS: That was very nice Ashley. 
ASHLEY: Can we do it again? 
ROSS: No-no. 
MONA: So, is it my turn now? 
FAT GIRL: I’m next! 
ROSS: Oh! 
MONA: Uh, that’s okay. You can dance with her first. 
ROSS: Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name. 
FAT GIRL: Gert! 
ROSS: That’s, that’s pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert? 
GERT: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it. 
ROSS: Okay. Hop on Gert. 
GERT: Why aren’t you moving your feet? 
ROSS: I’m trying. 
GERT: Faster! You’re not going fast enough! 
ROSS: Maybe I should stand on your feet! 
JOEY: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there? 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Oh my God, that was for my benefit? 
JOEY: Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show… 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Look umm Joey, I-I don’t think you’re quite right for this project. 
JOEY: Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me. 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese? 
JOEY: Well I’m not proud of this, but… 
DENNIS PHILLIPS: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don’t-don’t-don’t! 
MONICA: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor? 
CHANDLER: Did it turn into sand? 
MONICA: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. 
CHANDLER: No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot. 
MONICA: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go. 
MR. GELLER: Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested. 
CHANDLER: Why? 
MR. GELLER: You stole my moves. 
RACHEL: How much longer? 
PHOEBE: 30 seconds. 
RACHEL: 30 seconds, okay. 
MONICA: Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna… 
RACHEL: Oh I know. I know. 
PHOEBE: It’s time. 
THE GIRLS: No!! 
MONICA: Go ahead Rach. 
RACHEL: Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me. 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Umm, it’s negative. 
RACHEL: What? 
PHOEBE: It’s negative. 
RACHEL: Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God. 
MONICA: Well… Well, great. 
PHOEBE: Here. 
RACHEL: Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative? 
PHOEBE: No, it’s positive. 
RACHEL: What?! 
PHOEBE: It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive. 
RACHEL: Are you sure? 
PHOEBE: Well yeah, I lied before. 
RACHEL: Oh! 
MONICA: Oh God… 
PHOEBE: Now you know how you really feel about it. 
RACHEL: Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game! 
MONICA: Are you really gonna do this? 
RACHEL: Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! 
PHOEBE: With who? 
RACHEL: Ah, it’s still not the time. 
ROSS: I just didn’t see the fast song coming. 
JOEY: Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay. 
ROSS: Oh, thank you. 
MONA: That is so sweet! 
JOEY: Yeah. 
MONA: No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there. 
JOEY: Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself. 
MONA: It’s Joey right? 
JOEY: Yeah. 
ROSS: Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! 
RACHEL: Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little! 
JOEY: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night? 
JOEY: No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill! 
CHANDLER: Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite. 
MONICA: That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife! 
CHANDLER: And I’m the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to! 
MONICA: Oh yeah, right. 
CHANDLER: We got the honeymoon. 
MONICA: That’s not ‘til Thursday. 
CHANDLER: The wedding pictures? 
MONICA: They won’t be ready for weeks. 
CHANDLER: Not the disposable cameras from the tables. 
MONICA: That’s true! I knew I married you for a reason! 
CHANDLER: I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home. 
MONICA: Okay. 
CHANDLER: What? What did you take a picture of? 
JOEY: Nothing! It was something. 
CHANDLER: Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet? 
RACHEL: Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left. 
CHANDLER: Oh. 
MONICA: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to. 
RACHEL: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end. 
CHANDLER: Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You’re 32! 
FRONT DESK CLERK: Here’s a copy of your bill. 
MONICA: Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night! 
JOEY: Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut? 
ROSS: Hi. 
CHANDLER: Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff? 
ROSS: Why not? It’s built into the price of the room. 
CHANDLER: Yeah but you don’t need——What is this? 
ROSS: Thread! 
CHANDLER: Score! Where are the disposable cameras? 
ROSS: What disposable cameras? 
CHANDLER: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? 
ROSS: No you didn’t. 
CHANDLER: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said… 
ROSS: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that. 
CHANDLER: So you don’t have the cameras?! 
ROSS: No. Sorry man. 
CHANDLER: So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak! 
ROSS: Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them. 
CHANDLER: Great. 
ROSS: In-in three minutes. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler? 
MONICA: No! But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is? 
PHOEBE: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman. 
MONICA: A tiny salt shaker!!! 
PHOEBE: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt! 
MONICA: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun. 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah. 
MONICA: Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them. 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
MONICA: Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think? 
PHOEBE: Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. 
MONICA: Or this one! 
RACHEL: Hi. 
MONICA: Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness? 
RACHEL: Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they? 
MONICA: No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant. 
PHOEBE: Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course. 
RACHEL: Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor? 
RACHEL: Ew! No! 
PHOEBE: What?! I think he’s cute. 
RACHEL: Well then you have his baby. 
PHOEBE: Believe me I’m trying. 
MONICA: Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism. 
RACHEL: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news. 
PHOEBE: Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different. 
RACHEL: Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam! 
MONICA: What was that bam? 
PHOEBE: I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus. 
JOEY: Hey! 
RACHEL: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant? 
JOEY: Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut! 
RACHEL: Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant! 
JOEY: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant? 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah. That’s me. 
JOEY: Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby? 
PHOEBE: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! 
JOEY: Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father? 
PHOEBE: You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. 
JOEY: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass! 
PHOEBE: David Lynn. 
JOEY: David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! 
MONICA: Who’s David Lynn? 
PHOEBE: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying. 
ROSS: Chandler? 
CHANDLER: Hey! Did you find the cameras? 
ROSS: No. Did you? 
CHANDLER: Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating. 
ROSS: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them. 
CHANDLER: Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed. 
ROSS: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed? 
CHANDLER: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up! 
ROSS: I’m sorry man. Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people. 
CHANDLER: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? 
ROSS: No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces. 
CHANDLER: Are you serious? 
ROSS: I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down? 
CHANDLER: Marriage advice? Really?! 
ROSS: I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers? 
CHANDLER: I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers. 
ROSS: What about the chairs? 
CHANDLER: She picked those out too. 
ROSS: How about the place settings? 
CHANDLER: That was her. 
ROSS: What did you do? 
CHANDLER: I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop? 
ROSS: Hmm. 
PHOEBE: Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet? 
RACHEL: Not yet. 
PHOEBE: Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther? 
RACHEL: No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther. 
PHOEBE: Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby… 
RACHEL: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now! 
PHOEBE: Why not? 
RACHEL: I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam! 
PHOEBE: Bus? 
RACHEL: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is! 
PHOEBE: Well-well but it is huge. 
RACHEL: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father. 
PHOEBE: You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of…See? 
JOEY: Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents? 
MONICA: No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay? 
JOEY: Okay. 
MONICA: Give me one more. 
JOEY: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
JOEY: Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say. 
PHOEBE: All right. 
JOEY: Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? 
MONICA: Oh my God! Joey! 
PHOEBE: Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! 
MONICA: You can’t marry him! 
PHOEBE: Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn! 
MONICA: Phoebe! 
JOEY: Why?! Why can’t she marry me?! 
PHOEBE: I can and I will! 
MONICA: She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant. 
JOEY: Oh my God. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months! 
PHOEBE: It’s Joey! 
JOEY: Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? Who’s the father? 
PHOEBE: We don’t know. 
JOEY: Ohh… I wonder if that dude. 
MONICA: There’s a dude? 
JOEY: Yeah. 
PHOEBE: Who? Who is it? 
JOEY: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… 
PHOEBE: Was that story over? 
JOEY: The guy left this. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! I know who the father is… 
MONICA: People have got to finish their stories! 
CHANDLER: Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us? 
WOMAN AT THE WEDDING: Oh! Of course. 
MAN AT THE WEDDING: Uh, would you take one of us? 
CHANDLER: Uhh… Yeah sure. Click! 
WOMAN AT THE WEDDING: It didn’t click. 
ROSS: I heard it. I heard it. 
MAN AT THE WEDDING: But there was no flash. 
WOMAN AT THE WEDDING: Why won’t you take our picture? 
CHANDLER: Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. 
MAN AT THE WEDDING: Uh, your finger was covering the lens. 
CHANDLER: Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here! 
PHOEBE: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go! 
RACHEL: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? 
PHOEBE: I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. 
RACHEL: Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now? 
PHOEBE: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? 
RACHEL: Uh, let’s rip! 
PHOEBE: Really? Are you sure? 
RACHEL: Oh Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Okay, sorry. Yeah. 
TAG: Hey Rach. 
CHANDLER: Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech. 
ROSS: Okay. Okay! 
ROSS: Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed. 
ANXIOUS WEDDING GUEST: That’s my car! 
ROSS: A ’95 LeSabre?! 
ANXIOUS WEDDING GUEST: Yes! 
ROSS: A green LeSabre? 
ANXIOUS WEDDING GUEST: Yes! 
ROSS: I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre. 
ANXIOUS WEDDING GUEST: Yes! Green-blue! 
ROSS: Well go! Go move it! 
CHANDLER: Okay, you ready for the last picture? 
ROSS: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding. 
TAG: So, what’s this about? 
PHOEBE: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. 
TAG: No. This is my red sweater. 
PHOEBE: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. 
TAG: What’s going on Rach? 
RACHEL: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? 
TAG: Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together. 
RACHEL: Oh, it’s just not the right time. 
TAG: It is the right time. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
TAG: I’m ready for more. 
RACHEL: Tag… 
TAG: Come on Rach, let’s give it another try. 
RACHEL: I’m having a baby. 
TAG: Oh. 
RACHEL: You can go. 
TAG: Thank you. 
MONICA: I don’t know how any of these got opened?! 
JOEY: You opened them all? 
MONICA: I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again! 
JOEY: Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! 
MONICA: Yeah. What is that? 
JOEY: Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami. 
MONICA: Hey! How’d it go? 
JOEY: Yeah. What-what did Tag say? 
RACHEL: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now? 
JOEY: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. 
RACHEL: Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra! 
MONICA: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? 
RACHEL: No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight. 
JOEY: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this. 
RACHEL: I’m not? 
JOEY: Listen I uh… It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me? 
RACHEL: What? 
MONICA: What?! 
PHOEBE: What?!! 
JOEY: Pheebs, give me the ring back! 
PHOEBE: No!! 
RACHEL: No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband. 
JOEY: I understand. 
RACHEL: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. 
PHOEBE: I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani. 
JOEY: Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered… 
PHOEBE: Ooh! A Salami Buddy! 
JOEY: There you go! 
CHANDLER: We’re back! 
MONICA: Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! Let’s stay in the kitchen! 
CHANDLER: It’s picture time. 
ROSS: Now you are going to love these. 
CHANDLER: Here’s a picture of Ross. And that’s me. And that’s me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple. 
MONICA: Wow! That is a great picture! 
CHANDLER: Eh? 
MONICA: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! 
ROSS: Huh, didn’t see that coming. 
CHANDLER: Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need——There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now. 
MONICA: That would be a good idea. 
CHANDLER: Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together! 
MONICA: You kissed another woman! 
CHANDLER: Call it even?! 
MONICA: Okay! 
ROSS: Well, I’m gonna go get these in some water. 
PHOEBE: Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding? 
ROSS: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month! 
MONICA AND PHOEBE: Oh my God!! 
JOEY: Oh my God! 
ROSS: Hey! How you doing? 
TAG: Good! Good, long time no see. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
TAG: Like your sweater. 
ROSS: Oh hey, right back at ya. 
TAG: Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh? 
ROSS: Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady? 
TAG: So whose is it? 
ROSS: Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later. 
TAG: Okay. 
ROSS: He is so weird. 
CHANDLER: Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon? 
MONICA: Yeah I am! 
CHANDLER: Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama… 
MONICA: That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone. 
JOEY: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Yeah! Have a great honeymoon! 
CHANDLER: I’d better go pack. 
MONICA: Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo. 
CHANDLER: A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. 
RACHEL: Oh good you’re still here! 
MONICA: Hey! 
RACHEL: I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! 
MONICA: Thank you. 
RACHEL: And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What? 
JOEY: We know its Ross! 
RACHEL: How?! How do you know? 
PHOEBE: It was his sweater, but—Oh my God! 
RACHEL: Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know. 
MONICA: This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt! 
RACHEL: I know! 
PHOEBE: Me too! 
JOEY: I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! 
RACHEL: You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles. 
MONICA: Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood. 
RACHEL: Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross! 
MONICA: Well, what were you gonna say? 
RACHEL: Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants. 
JOEY: Well that, that sounds good. 
RACHEL: Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks. 
MONICA: Hey! Good luck! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, bye. 
JOEY: Bye. 
CHANDLER: Hey, what was that all about? 
MONICA: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby. 
CHANDLER: What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?! 
MONICA: I didn’t think you could keep it a secret. 
CHANDLER: What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets. 
JOEY: What secrets? 
CHANDLER: Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper. 
JOEY: You’ll tell me later? 
CHANDLER: You already know. 
PHOEBE: Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon. 
JOEY: Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something. 
PHOEBE: All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later. 
JOEY: I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you. 
PHOEBE: What?! They took mine to give to you! 
JOEY: Why would they take away our keys? 
PHOEBE: Maybe they don’t trust us. 
JOEY: No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town. 
PHOEBE: You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels? 
JOEY: Hey, I washed those! 
PHOEBE: No you didn’t. 
JOEY: Yeah that didn’t sound like me. 
PHOEBE: Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar! 
JOEY: Yeah, I have stuff in there too. 
PHOEBE: What stuff? 
JOEY: Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. 
ROSS: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Did Rachel find you? 
ROSS: No why? 
PHOEBE: Oh she was looking for you. 
ROSS: Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later. 
PHOEBE: Well, she really wanted to talk to you now. 
JOEY: Yeah, it seemed pretty important. 
ROSS: Oh no. 
PHOEBE: What? 
ROSS: I think I might know what this is about. 
JOEY: Really? 
ROSS: Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together. 
PHOEBE: And? 
ROSS: Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked. 
PHOEBE: Oh sorry. And?! 
ROSS: Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again. 
JOEY: Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is. 
ROSS: Why? What-what else could it be? 
JOEY: Oh wow, I don’t feel well. 
ROSS: I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you? 
PHOEBE: Maybe it’s something you ate? 
JOEY: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel. 
ROSS: Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. 
TICKET AGENT: Next? 
MONICA: They’re kissing let’s just go around them. 
CHANDLER: Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love. 
MONICA: I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion. 
TICKET AGENT: Next? 
MONICA: Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, "Next." 
WOMAN: Sorry. We didn’t hear you; we’re on our honeymoon. 
TICKET AGENT: Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available. 
MONICA: Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon. 
CHANDLER: We are on our honeymoon. 
MONICA: Grab my ass! 
TICKET AGENT: Next? 
MONICA: Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon. 
TICKET AGENT: Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K. 
MONICA: Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class? 
TICKET AGENT: I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two. 
MONICA: You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit! 
CHANDLER: 25J and K, any chance those aren’t together? 
JOEY: I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours. 
PHOEBE: Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place. 
JOEY: What the hell is that? 
JOEY: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing? 
MR. TREEGER: You said there was a gas leak in here. 
PHOEBE: Well why don’t you use your key? 
MR. TREEGER: Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up. 
PHOEBE: Oh! We could have done that. 
MONICA: Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there? 
CHANDLER: No. 
MONICA: Me neither! We have to get in! 
CHANDLER: Just act like you belong. 
MONICA: Oh my God! Oranges! 
CHANDLER: Shh! Nice to see you again. 
AIRLINE EMPLOYEE: Uh sir, may I see your tickets please? 
CHANDLER: Yes, of course. 
AIRLINE EMPLOYEE: I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number. 
CHANDLER: Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A. 
AIRLINE EMPLOYEE: Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I’m sorry. 
CHANDLER: Apology accepted. Excuse us. 
AIRLINE EMPLOYEE: Sir! I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave. 
MONICA: Fine. Go! Go! Go! 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi. Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about. 
ROSS: I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? Look uh, I know why you’re here. 
RACHEL: You do? 
ROSS: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it? 
RACHEL: What? 
ROSS: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends? 
RACHEL: Seriously. What?! 
ROSS: Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now. 
RACHEL: Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now? 
ROSS: Oh sure. 
RACHEL: I’m pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you’re ready. And you’re the father by the way—but you got that… 
RACHEL: Can I get you some water? 
ROSS: I’m good. I’m good. 
RACHEL: Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. 
ROSS: Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom. 
RACHEL: I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time. 
ROSS: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!! 
RACHEL: They do! 
ROSS: No they don’t!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!! 
RACHEL: Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms. 
ROSS: Oh well I may as well have! 
RACHEL: Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out… 
ROSS: Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer! 
RACHEL: Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later. 
ROSS: No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company! 
RACHEL: Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… 
ROSS: Shh! Shh! Shh! 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Yeah I’ll press 1! 
MR. TREEGER: I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak. 
JOEY: Huh. So then I can heat this up? 
MR. TREEGER: Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door. 
PHOEBE: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them. 
MR. TREEGER: Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll find out anyway. 
PHOEBE: Oh no. 
MR. TREEGER: Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross! 
ROSS: Hi. 
MR. TREEGER: Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today? 
ROSS: Sure. 
MR. TREEGER: Namaste. 
ROSS: Namaste. 
ROSS: Oh my God! What happened to the door?! 
JOEY: So it’s noticeable huh? 
ROSS: Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her. 
PHOEBE: Didn’t you two already talk? 
ROSS: Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. Rachel’s pregnant. 
JOEY: Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!! 
PHOEBE: Holy mother of God!!! 
ROSS: With my child. 
PHOEBE: That is brand new information!! 
ROSS: You already know don’t you? 
PHOEBE: A little bit. 
JOEY: How are you doing? 
ROSS: Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well. 
JOEY: Well, what did you say to her? 
ROSS: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone. 
PHOEBE: Oh Ross. 
ROSS: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective. 
JOEY: What? 
ROSS: I gotta go find her. 
JOEY: Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box! 
ROSS: Evidently they do. 
JOEY: What?! 
MONICA: I can’t believe we’re here. 
CHANDLER: Oh you’ve got to be kidding me. 
MONICA: What? 
FRONT DESK CLERK: As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite. 
MONICA: No!! You have been screwing us all day! 
MAN: Who are you? 
CHANDLER: We’re you just ten seconds later! 
MONICA: Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon! 
WOMAN: Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together. 
CHANDLER: We need the stuff. 
JOEY: Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment. 
MONICA: What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas! 
CHANDLER: What else is new? 
JOEY: Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys. 
MONICA: Well do something! Get in there! 
JOEY: How? I guess I could break down your door. 
MONICA: Yeah! Do that! 
JOEY: And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? 
MONICA: No! Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on! 
JOEY: Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. 
PHOEBE: Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. Okay, we’re in. 
NURSE: Okay Rachel, are you comfortable? 
RACHEL: If I said I was, would you judge me? 
NURSE: The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram. 
RACHEL: Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn… 
ROSS: Hi! 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ROSS: Uh we-we need to talk. 
RACHEL: Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here. 
ROSS: Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today. 
RACHEL: Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head? 
ROSS: What? Oh yeah. I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really—I should have been thinking about you Rach… 
RACHEL: Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross! 
ROSS: Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married. 
RACHEL: What married? 
ROSS: Well yeah, I think we should get married. 
RACHEL: What, because that’s your answer to everything? 
ROSS: No, because that’s the right thing to do. 
RACHEL: Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we? 
ROSS: No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone. 
RACHEL: Excuse me? 
ROSS: Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant. 
RACHEL: What?! 
ROSS: I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself? 
RACHEL: I can too eat by myself! 
ROSS: When have you ever? 
RACHEL: When certain people leave the table and I am not finished! 
ROSS: Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup! 
RACHEL: Oh please, you inhale your food! 
ROSS: I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!! 
DR. LONG: Am I interrupting? 
RACHEL: Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father. 
ROSS: But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone. 
DR. LONG: Huh. Nice to meet you. I’ll get started on this. 
ROSS: I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me. 
RACHEL: I do need you! I need you to stand near my head! 
DR. LONG: Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby. 
ROSS: Oh my God. 
RACHEL: Wow. There it is, I see it. 
DR. LONG: Congratulations. I’ll give you two a minute. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Thank you. 
ROSS: Pretty amazing huh? 
RACHEL: I don’t see it! 
ROSS: What? What?! 
RACHEL: I can’t see it! 
ROSS: You-you just said that you did! 
RACHEL: I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby! 
ROSS: Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there . 
RACHEL: Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now. 
ROSS: Do you really? 
RACHEL: No, I don’t see it! 
ROSS: Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
ROSS: Sweetie that’s it. 
RACHEL: That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you. 
ROSS: You’re welcome. 
RACHEL: Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby. 
ROSS: Yeah, that’s our baby. 
RACHEL: Hi. 
JOEY: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Hey! So how was the doctor? 
RACHEL: Oh, everything went great. 
PHOEBE: Good. 
ROSS: Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
JOEY: I don’t see the baby. Where is it? 
RACHEL: Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… Ross, I lost it again. 
ROSS: Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her. 
CHANDLER: Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together. 
MONICA: You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? 
PHOEBE: Hi! 
JOEY: Hey! You’re back! 
MONICA: Hi sweetie! 
PHOEBE: Come on in! 
PHOEBE: So how was the honeymoon? 
MONICA: Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back. 
PHOEBE: That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger. 
MONICA: No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too! 
CHANDLER: They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city. 
MONICA: Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call. 
CHANDLER: I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with. 
MONICA: I know. 
JOEY: A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people? 
MONICA: This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship. 
PHOEBE: Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg. 
CHANDLER: Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance… 
JOEY: Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here? 
CHANDLER: We really…didn’t get a chance to… 
PHOEBE: You have got to be kidding me! 
MONICA: We didn’t get anything for anyone. 
JOEY: Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace! 
MONICA: That you can have. 
{TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE: Tradition was broken here as there were no commercials immediately after the opening credits, just more show.} 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ALL: Hey! 
ROSS: Hello! 
RACHEL: Welcome home. 
ROSS: So, how was the honeymoon? 
MONICA: It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby! 
RACHEL: Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture! 
MONICA: Oh great! 
CHANDLER: Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines! 
MONICA: All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen? 
PHOEBE: Monica! That’s not right! Start with where. 
RACHEL: Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey. 
JOEY: You’re welcome buddy. 
ROSS: Yeah, thanks. 
RACHEL: And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me. 
ROSS: Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading. 
RACHEL: What is? 
ROSS: The lie you just told. 
RACHEL: That-that you came on to me? 
ROSS: There’s the one! 
RACHEL: But you did! I mean, let’s be honest. 
ROSS: Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who. 
JOEY: Whom. That’s right. 
RACHEL: You know you kissed me first. 
ROSS: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place! 
RACHEL: I was sending you signals? 
ROSS: Yeah! 
RACHEL: Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. 
ROSS: Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened! 
RACHEL: Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now? 
ROSS: Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it. 
RACHEL: No please, show me how I begged you! 
ROSS: I can show you, I have it on videotape! It’s an expression. 
PHOEBE: I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex! 
JOEY: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. 
CHANDLER: Y’know who has a great video camera? 
PHOEBE: Greg and Jenny? 
MONICA: Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em. 
CHANDLER: Let’s call ‘em. 
JOEY: Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! 
MONICA: Hello? Eighth street deli? 
JOEY: Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place. 
MONICA: Uh sorry, wrong number. 
CHANDLER: Here you go. 
MONICA: Hello? It’s the deli again! 
JOEY: All right! I’ll have a sandwich! 
MONICA: I don’t think this number’s right! 
CHANDLER: What? 
PHOEBE: You got fake numbered. 
MONICA: What?! People don’t do that! 
JOEY: Oh I think we do. 
MONICA: They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that? 
CHANDLER: I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked al l those insightful, great questions. 
MONICA: And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot! 
JOEY: Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe. 
PHOEBE: Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects. 
ROSS: Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door! 
PHOEBE: Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert! 
ROSS: Okay, listen I am not a pervert! 
PHOEBE: That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that! 
ROSS: Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing. 
JOEY: Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know. 
ROSS: About…about sex? That I hadn’t had sex in months? 
JOEY: Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about. 
ROSS: Hey! 
JOEY: Hey. 
ROSS: Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about. 
JOEY: Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom? 
ROSS: I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise. 
JOEY: Whoa, for like months? 
ROSS: Five to be lying, six. 
JOEY: Six months? Whoa that’s rough. 
ROSS: Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky. 
JOEY: The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday! 
ROSS: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health! 
JOEY: Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty. 
ROSS: Really? Well then tell it to me. 
JOEY: Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story. 
ROSS: I’ll try to control myself. 
JOEY: Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe… 
ROSS: You were backpacking across Western Europe? 
JOEY: Have a nice six more months Ross! 
ROSS: Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and? 
JOEY: I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying… 
ROSS: Why? 
KRISTEN: Umm, this is great wine. 
ROSS: It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. 
KRISTEN: Really? 
ROSS: Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. 
KRISTEN: I studied for a year in Barcelona. 
ROSS: Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking… 
KRISTEN: I love hiking! 
ROSS: Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo… 
KRISTEN: I think its Tibidabo. 
ROSS: Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?! 
JOEY: Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go? 
ROSS: Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks! 
JOEY: Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it. 
ROSS: No! No, I don’t…don’t want to. 
JOEY: How long since you’ve seen a girl naked? 
ROSS: I was backpacking across Western Europe. 
JOEY: I’m not feeling it. 
ROSS: I was just outside Barcelona, hiking… 
JOEY: No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot? 
ROSS: It’s been six months! I’m always hot! 
JOEY: Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong. 
ROSS: I’ll try that. 
JOEY: All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right? 
ROSS: Thanks. 
JOEY: Good luck. 
ROSS: Thanks. And-and hey Joe? 
JOEY: Yeah? 
ROSS: Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out. 
JOEY: That means a lot to me man. 
ROSS: Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel! 
RACHEL: Oh Ross! 
ROSS: Hi! 
RACHEL: Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? 
ROSS: That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was. 
ROSS: So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. 
MONICA: Yeah, definitely. 
ROSS: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me! 
JOEY: Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape! 
ROSS: Thank you. No! 
JOEY: You’re right. 
ROSS: Joey! No! 
JOEY: Loud and clear! 
MONICA: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number. 
JOEY: Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either. 
MONICA: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names. 
JOEY: Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you. 
PHOEBE: Regina Philange. 
CHANDLER: I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong. 
MONICA: I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. 
CHANDLER: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! 
MONICA: Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! 
CHANDLER: Well maybe it was all of your questions. 
MONICA: What about my questions? 
CHANDLER: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler! 
MONICA: Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke? 
CHANDLER: Was that another question? 
RACHEL: Hey! Is Ross still here? 
JOEY: Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake. 
RACHEL: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. 
ROSS: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. 
RACHEL: Thank you. What? You don’t want to see this do you? 
MONICA: Hell yeah!!! 
RACHEL: I am not gonna show you this! 
PHOEBE: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. 
ROSS: Forget it, she’s destroying it. 
PHOEBE: Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!! 
ROSS: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story. 
RACHEL: I wanna see it. 
ROSS: What?! 
RACHEL: Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see? 
JOEY: Are we watchin’ the tape or not?! 
ROSS: I don’t want people to see it for your sake. 
RACHEL: Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. 
ROSS: Rachel, please… 
RACHEL: Ah, a little preview! 
ROSS: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying… 
RACHEL: Okay, here we go. 
ROSS: Hello! Can I get you anything? 
JOEY: I’m so happy! 
RACHEL: Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? 
RACHEL: There I am. 
PHOEBE: You’re gonna get pregnant. 
RACHEL: I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I… 
ROSS: You didn’t do it? 
RACHEL: I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today. 
MONICA: Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine. 
RACHEL: Kinda hurtin’ my hand though. 
MONICA: I know. 
RACHEL: I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh… 
CHANDLER: Did you do it on our invitations?! 
ROSS: Not on the ones we sent out. 
CHANDLER: So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! 
RACHEL: Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged. 
ROSS: I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost… 
RACHEL: Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it? 
ROSS: I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to. 
RACHEL: Oh I wanted to. 
ROSS: So we…we both wanted to. 
RACHEL: Interesting. 
ROSS: Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best. 
RACHEL: Oh yeah, sure. 
RACHEL: Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me. 
ROSS: And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why. 
RACHEL: Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe? 
RACHEL: Okay, get ready to see some beggin’! 
PHOEBE: Oh, you came on to Ross! 
RACHEL: What?! 
ROSS: Now I’m so happy. 
RACHEL: What are you talking about?! 
MONICA: You used the Europe story! 
CHANDLER: That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex! 
RACHEL: How do you know about that story?! 
JOEY: How do you know about that story?! 
RACHEL: I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy! 
JOEY: Some guy!! 
RACHEL: No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams. 
JOEY: Ken Adams!! 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? 
ROSS: Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve. 
RACHEL: It was an amazing night. 
ROSS: It was. It was an amazing night. 
RACHEL: You think it looked amazing? 
ROSS: I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it. 
RACHEL: Yeah, me neither. Yet… 
ROSS: Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird. 
RACHEL: Yeah, it would be really weird. 
ROSS: Good luck. 
RACHEL: Good luck to you. 
ROSS: Mind if I mute? 
RACHEL: Oh please. 
ROSS: Oh, oh there go the clothes. 
RACHEL: You are undressing very quickly. 
ROSS: Six months Rachel, six months. 
ROSS AND RACHEL: Ah. Oh. 
ROSS: Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good. 
RACHEL: That’s what I was gonna say. 
ROSS: Oh nice tan! 
RACHEL: Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend. 
ROSS: Ah…. 
RACHEL: Have you been working out? 
ROSS: I have been working out. 
RACHEL: Really? Wow, this is so much better than I… 
ROSS AND RACHEL: Ohh! Ew! 
ROSS: Oh that’s not pretty. 
RACHEL: Oh! Oh! 
ROSS: No! 
RACHEL: Oh God! 
ROSS: Oh no! 
RACHEL: Oh, make it stop! 
ROSS: Oh no!! 
RACHEL: Make it stop!! 
ROSS: No!! 
RACHEL: Have to make it stop!! 
ROSS: No!!! 
MONICA: Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… That is their old number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved! 
CHANDLER: Jenny! That is so Jenny! 
MONICA: Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y’know what Greg? Y’know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can’t see that then… January 15th? We’ll see you then! Okay! 
MONICA: Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey how was dinner?! 
PHOEBE: Dinner was good! 
MONICA: Okay! 
PHOEBE: I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go! 
MONICA: Okay! 
PHOEBE: Oh, well hello there. 
GUY: Hi. 
PHOEBE: I didn’t see this on the menu. 
MONICA: Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef. 
PHOEBE: Oh, so you're Monica’s boss? 
TIM: Actually she’s my-my boss. Sous is French for under. 
PHOEBE: Oh! I sous stand. 
MONICA: Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto? 
TIM: Yeah. 
PHOEBE: Oh you…you made pesto? 
TIM: Yes I did. 
PHOEBE: Would you say your pesto is the best-o? 
TIM: I…I-I don’t know, but I would say it’s pretty good-o. 
MONICA: All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad. 
TIM: I like your necklace. 
PHOEBE: I made it myself. 
TIM: You are so talented. 
PHOEBE: Well, it’s no pesto. 
MONICA: All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? You’re single. You’re single. He gets off work at eleven. She’ll be waiting for your call. I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar. 
MR. FRANKLIN: Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil. 
CHANDLER: You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn? 
MR. FRANKLIN: You’re a joker Bing. 
CHANDLER: What’s funny about that? 
ROSS: Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long. 
CHANDLER: Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go? 
ROSS: Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go. 
CHANDLER: The Hard Rock Café? 
ROSS: Yeah! 
CHANDLER: Again?! 
ROSS: Yeah!! 
ROSS: I’m telling you, I like the food! 
CHANDLER: You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob. 
BOB: Hey Toby! Have a good night. 
ROSS: Did that guy just call you Toby? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, he thinks that’s my name. 
ROSS: Well, why don’t you correct him? 
CHANDLER: Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby. 
ROSS: Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him! 
CHANDLER: No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. 
ROSS: Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!! 
CHANDLER: Shh! It is a family name! 
ROSS: Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they? 
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss. 
DR. DRAKE RAMORAY: What is it? 
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain. 
DR. DRAKE RAMORAY: Is it serious? 
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain. 
DR. DRAKE RAMORAY: Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that. 
JOEY'S CO-STAR: We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone. 
DIRECTOR: Cut! Very nice people! 
JOEY: Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner. 
RACHEL: Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?! 
JOEY: I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV! 
RACHEL: You don’t know do you? 
JOEY: No, couldn’t care less. 
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey good scene man. 
JOEY: Hey you too! 
JOEY'S CO-STAR: Alright. 
JOEY: What? You weren’t in it. 
RACHEL: Oh! 
JOEY: Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash? 
KASH: Yes? 
JOEY: This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel. 
RACHEL: Hi. 
KASH: Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before? 
RACHEL: Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm. 
JOEY: Here we go! Here we go! 
RACHEL: Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash. 
KASH: Bye. 
RACHEL: Say hi to Wally. 
PHOEBE: Ooh Monica! 
MONICA: Hi! 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him. 
MONICA: I…I have to fire him. 
PHOEBE: But why?! 
MONICA: Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire! 
PHOEBE: Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two. 
MONICA: Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished. 
PHOEBE: But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please? 
MONICA: All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there! 
PHOEBE: That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too. 
MONICA: I paid to have this done. 
PHOEBE: Love it! 
JOEY: Hey! 
RACHEL: Hi! 
JOEY: Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming. 
RACHEL: I thought I was a complete idiot. 
JOEY: Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him. 
RACHEL: Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say? 
JOEY: I said no. 
RACHEL: What?! 
JOEY: What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people. 
RACHEL: Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant? 
JOEY: I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people. 
RACHEL: Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay? 
JOEY: Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great… 
RACHEL: Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all! 
CHANDLER: Hey Bob. 
BOB: Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today? 
CHANDLER: If I see him, I’ll ask. 
BOB: Toby! 
MR. FRANKLIN: Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too? 
CHANDLER: Yeah! 
MR. FRANKLIN: Oh then you know each other. 
CHANDLER: We’re on a semi-first name basis. 
MR. FRANKLIN: What do you think of adding him to our team? 
CHANDLER: Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes. 
MR. FRANKLIN: Really? They love him down on six. 
CHANDLER: But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here. 
MR. FRANKLIN: Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. 
CHANDLER: I think it’s best sir. 
MR. FRANKLIN: But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. 
CHANDLER: Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em. 
MR. FRANKLIN: That’s a good one. 
CHANDLER: What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go! 
PHOEBE: But… 
MONICA: No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!" 
PHOEBE: Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today. 
MONICA: Why not?! 
PHOEBE: Because I’m dumping him today. 
MONICA: What?! You said he was sweet! 
PHOEBE: He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?" 
MONICA: Just don’t pick up your phone. 
PHOEBE: Then he comes over! "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man! 
MONICA: What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him? 
PHOEBE: You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself. 
MONICA: Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week. 
PHOEBE: Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself! 
MONICA: Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it! 
PHOEBE: Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch. 
MONICA: What do you mean? 
PHOEBE: Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch! 
MONICA: I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first. 
PHOEBE: All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! 
BOB: Hey Toby, you got a sec? 
CHANDLER: Sure, what’s up? 
BOB: I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler? 
RACHEL: Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?" 
ROSS: Hey! 
RACHEL: Hi! 
JOEY: Hey! 
ROSS: So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested? 
JOEY: No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya. 
ROSS: Rach? You wanna come? 
RACHEL: Oh no, I can’t. I got a date. 
ROSS: A date? 
RACHEL: Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you? 
ROSS: Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull. 
JOEY: It’s no Ukrainian film. 
RACHEL: Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! 
ROSS: A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who? 
JOEY: I set her up with this actor on my show. 
ROSS: You set her up?! 
JOEY: No 
ROSS: Joey what-what were you thinking?! 
JOEY: Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years! 
ROSS: Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them? 
JOEY: Hey! I’m an actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island. 
ROSS: A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?! 
JOEY: Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? 
ROSS: Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!! 
KASH: Hey Joey. 
JOEY: Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash. 
KASH: Hey. 
ROSS: Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight. 
KASH: Yeah. 
ROSS: A bit of a daredevil are we? 
RACHEL: Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash! 
KASH: Hey Rachel! You ready to go? 
RACHEL: Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later. 
ROSS: Okay. Have a great time you guys. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
KASH: Thank you. 
ROSS: Yes it is too slutty! 
TIM: Hi! 
PHOEBE: Hi. 
TIM: Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe? 
PHOEBE: It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy. 
TIM: It’s because I’m with you. 
PHOEBE: Aw. I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I… 
TIM: Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. 
PHOEBE: Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay. 
TIM: Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here. 
JOEY: So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books. 
ROSS: Books? 
JOEY: All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough! 
ROSS: Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang. 
JOEY: And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date? 
ROSS: Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no. 
JOEY: Dude! What is going on?! 
ROSS: I just…I have to find out how it went. 
JOEY: Why? 
ROSS: This guy could be my baby’s stepfather! 
JOEY: They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you! 
ROSS: I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?! 
JOEY: Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do? 
ROSS: I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening. 
JOEY: What do you mean? 
ROSS: It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section. 
JOEY: That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that! 
ROSS: No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away. 
JOEY: Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel? 
ROSS: It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though. 
JOEY: Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel. 
ROSS: No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were? 
JOEY: I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants. 
ROSS: No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now. 
JOEY: That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like? 
ROSS: Yeah. 
JOEY: Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on! 
ROSS: We can still catch that Ukrainian film. 
JOEY: No, I said fun! 
BOB: Hey Toby! 
CHANDLER: Hey Bobby. 
BOB: It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is? 
CHANDLER: Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why? 
BOB: I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is. 
CHANDLER: Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here. 
BOB: Toby don’t. 
CHANDLER: Bob! 
BOB: Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Well that puts me in a difficult position. 
MONICA: Hey. 
TIM: I got your page, is everything okay? 
MONICA: Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe? 
TIM: Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us! 
MONICA: Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Monica! 
MONICA: You’re fired! 
PHOEBE: I’m breaking up with you! 
TIM: What? 
PHOEBE: I’m, I’m breaking up with you. 
MONICA: You’re fired. 
TIM: Why? 
PHOEBE: I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now. 
MONICA: Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right. 
PHOEBE: Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too. 
TIM: Wow! Umm, okay. Umm… I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it’s only because I think you’re so amazing. And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I—you’re the most talented chef I’ve ever worked for. Anyway… 
MONICA: Tim wait! 
TIM: Yeah? 
MONICA: Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again. 
TIM: Really? 
MONICA: Yeah. 
TIM: Thank you so much! ‘Cause I-I know I can do better! 
MONICA: Okay. 
PHOEBE: And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. 
ROSS: Hello. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ROSS: Well, how was the date? 
RACHEL: Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think? 
ROSS: Uh-huh. What happened? 
RACHEL: I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant. 
ROSS: Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well? 
RACHEL: Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want. 
ROSS: Oh? 
RACHEL: He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch." 
ROSS: He sounds swell. 
RACHEL: Doesn’t he? 
ROSS: Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up? 
RACHEL: Yes. 
ROSS: Sit down. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Guess whose middle name is Muriel. 
RACHEL: Chandler M. Bing? 
ROSS: Yeah-ha! 
RACHEL: Oh my God. 
ROSS: I’m sorry about your date. 
RACHEL: Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard. 
ROSS: Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea. 
RACHEL: Thanks sweetie. 
ROSS: You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee? 
RACHEL: Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. 
ROSS: Hey, I thought I cheered you up. 
RACHEL: Oh you did, there are twenty in here. 
ROSS: Right. Good night. 
RACHEL: Good night. 
MONA: Ross? 
ROSS: Yeah? 
MONA: Hey it’s Mona! From the wedding. 
ROSS: Oh hi! 
MONA: Hi! 
ROSS: Wow! Uh…how are you? 
MONA: I’m good except umm, you still owe me a dance. 
ROSS: Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film? 
MONA: Oh you’re serious. Sure! 
ROSS: Great! Well umm… 
MONA: I think I might need one more cup of coffee. 
ROSS: Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya. 
MONA: Okay. 
CHANDLER: Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?! 
BOB: I just found out this is Chandler’s office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
