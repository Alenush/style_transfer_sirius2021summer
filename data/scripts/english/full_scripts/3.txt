JOEY: I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me. 
ALL : Did not, she did not wink at you.... 
CHAN: Huh. 
ROSS: I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison. 
RACH: Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were. 
PHOE: See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss. 
RACH: What song was that, Pheebs? 
PHOE: Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za. 
PHOE: Hi Monica! 
ROSS: Hey Mon! 
RACH: Hey Mon! 
PHOE: Oh my God, has she slept at all? 
ROSS: Nope. 
RACH: No, it's been three nights in a row. 
ROSS: Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so. 
PHOE: Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call. 
CHANDLER: Morning. 
JOEY: Morning, hey, you made pancakes? 
CHAN: Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that. 
JANC: Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey. 
JOEY: Good morning. 
CHAN: Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me. 
JANC: Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer. 
CHAN: I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up. 
JANC: I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss. 
CHAN: Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay. 
JOEY: Kiss her! Kiss her! 
JANC: I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey. 
JOEY: B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her. 
CHAN: Nope, not this time. 
JOEY: Come on, quite yankin' me. 
CHAN: I'm not *yanking* you. 
JOEY: This is Janice. 
CHAN: Yeah, I know. She makes me happy. 
JOEY: Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking. 
CHAN: I'm not breaking up with her! 
MONC: God, look what I found in the drain. 
RACH: What?! 
MONC: It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this? 
ROSS: Getting it away from me would be job one. 
MONC: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! 
PHOE: Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. 
MONC: God, what is wrong with me. 
ROSS: You need to get some sleep. 
MONC: I need to get some Richard. 
RACH: Monica, you broke up with him for a reason. 
MONC: I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called! 
PHOE: Maybe, because you told him not to. 
MONC: What are you the memory woman? 
JOEY: Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything. 
RACH: Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute. 
JOEY: Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice? 
RACH: Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do? 
JOEY: There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross? 
ROSS: Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her. 
JOEY: Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right? 
RACH: Honey, I was wondering.... 
ROSS: Hmm? 
RACH: Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform? 
ROSS: Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place. 
RACH: Hmm. 
ROSS: I think I have an old band uniform from high school. 
RACH: You remember not having sex in high school, right? 
ROSS: Yeah. 
RACH: Well honey, what about you? 
ROSS: What? 
RACH: I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things? 
ROSS: No. 
RACH: Come on you gotta have one! 
ROSS: Nope. 
RACH: Ross, you know what... 
ROSS: What? 
RACH: ...if you tell me, I might do it. 
ROSS: Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi? 
RACH: Yeah. 
ROSS: Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. 
RACH: Oooh! 
ROSS: Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool. 
PHOE: Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that. 
RACH: Really! 
PHOE: Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know. 
RACH: Did you ever do the-the Leia thing? 
PHOE: Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh! 
RACH: Really! That-that great huh? 
PHOE: No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya! 
ROSS: Hey! 
RACH: Hi you guys! 
ROSS: Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter. 
RACH: Mon. Hi! 
MONC: Hi. 
RACH: Why aren't you at work? 
MONC: Oh, they-they sent me home. 
RACH: Why? 
MONC: Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon. 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACH: You really, really need to get some sleep, honey. 
MONC: I know I do. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACH: Hi. 
ROSS: Guess what? 
RACH: What? 
ROSS: They published my paper. 
RACH: Oh, really, let me see, let me see. 
PHOE: Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is. 
CHAN: Hey! 
JOEY: Wheel! 
CHAN: Of! 
JOEY: Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!! 
CHAN: You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say? 
JOEY: I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to? 
CHAN: No, Janice. 
JOEY: Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers. 
CHAN: You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice? 
JOEY: No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ? 
CHAN: Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh! 
JOEY: Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know. 
CHAN: Well, there you go. 
JOEY: Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember? 
CHAN: Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters. 
JOEY: Look, what do you want me to say? 
CHAN: I want you to say that you like her! 
JOEY: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. 
CHAN: Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore! 
JOEY: Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? 
ROSS: How could you have told her? 
RACH: Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal. 
ROSS: Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal. 
RACH: Okay, who are you talking to when you do that? 
ROSS: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us. 
RACH: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff. 
ROSS: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'. 
RACH: Were both of those Joey? 
ROSS: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her. 
RACH: Not even with your best friend. 
ROSS: Noo! 
RACH: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are. 
ROSS: Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything? 
RACH: Pretty much. 
ROSS: Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times? 
RACH: Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol. 
ROSS: I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think. 
PHOE: Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place. 
MONC: Richard's living room, drinking wine. 
PHOE: All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out! 
MONC: I'm sorry, but that's my happy place. 
PHOE: Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything. 
MONC: All right, I'll try not to. 
PHOE: Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky.... 
MONC: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake? 
PHOE: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees.... 
MONC: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine. 
PHOE: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook.... 
MONC: Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee. 
JANC: So, I hear, you hate me! 
JOEY: I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that. 
JANC: A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me. 
JOEY: And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there... 
JANC: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together. 
JOEY: But what does that gonna do... 
JANC: For Chandler! 
JOEY: Okay. I'm in. 
JANC: Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's *DAY* *OF* *FUN!*' 
JOEY: Does it have to be a whole day? 
JANC: Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me. 
JOEY: Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room. 
MONC: So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War. 
PHOE: Monica, do you want us to take you home? 
MONC: Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. 
ROSS: Women tell each other everything. Did you know that? 
CHAN: Umm, yeah. 
ROSS: No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.... 
CHAN: Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? 
ROSS: Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna? 
CHAN: We're not gonna talk about girth are we? 
ROSS: Nooo! 
CHAN: Yeah, okay. 
ROSS: Yeah? 
CHAN: Yeah! All right! You go first. 
ROSS: Okay, okay, I'll go first. 
CHAN: Okay. 
ROSS: So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing.... 
CHAN: Princess Leia in the gold bikini. 
ROSS: Yes! 
CHAN: I know! 
ROSS: Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go. 
CHAN: Okay. 
ROSS: Okay. 
CHAN: Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. 
ROSS: Hmph. 
CHAN: And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... 
ROSS: With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa! 
CHAN: I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know! 
ROSS: Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you? 
CHAN: You said... 
ROSS: I said '*share*' not '*scare*'. Go sit over there! . 
JANC: We're baack! 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHAN: What are you guys doing together? 
JANC: Joey and Janice's *DAY* *OF* *FUN*!!! 
CHAN: Really. 
JOEY: Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy. 
JANC: I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. 
CHAN: You still can't stand her can you? 
JOEY: I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did. 
CHAN: Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot. 
JOEY: But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium. 
CHAN: Well, I guess that's something. 
JOEY: No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway. 
CHAN: Okay. 
JOEY: Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross. 
CHAN: Oh God! 
JOEY: Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too. 
CHAN: Really? 
JOEY: Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex. 
VIDEO: April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, Sixty-One , 4:30 A.M. on Tuesday, the United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon it is now under bombardment by.... 
MONC: Hi, Dad, what are you doing here? 
MR. GELLER: Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars? 
MONC: I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad? 
MR. GELLER: Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. 
MONC: What makes you think that I might not be okay? 
MR. GELLER: I saw Richard. 
MONC: Oh. 
MR. GELLER: So, how are you doing? 
MONC: I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing? 
MR. GELLER: You don't wanna know. 
MONC: No, I really, really do. 
MR. GELLER: Well, he's doing terrible! 
MONC: Really! 
MR. GELLER: Worse than when he broke up with Barbara. 
MONC: You're not just saying that are you? 
MR. GELLER: No, the man is a mess. 
MONC: Was he crying? 
MR. GELLER: No. 
MONC: Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry? 
MR. GELLER: Maybe. 
MONC: I think so. 
MR. GELLER: Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, 
RACH: Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What? 
ROSS: No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's 
MRS. GELLER: Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here. 
ROSS: I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. 
JOEY: All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. 
CHANDLER: Taste it. 
JOEY: Yep, it's fat. I drank fat! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago. 
ROSS: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey, mister tux! 
ROSS: Why aren't you guys dressed? 
JOEY: We have a half hour. 
ROSS: No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight. 
JOEY: Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed. 
ROSS: Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Okay. 
RACHEL: Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy. 
ROSS: Really. 
RACHEL: Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: How come you didn't come over earlier? 
ROSS: 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man. 
JOEY: Hey, Ross, want some cider? 
ROSS: No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done. 
RACHEL: Yeah, I just have to get dressed. 
ROSS: Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes. 
RACHEL: Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing. 
JOEY: Glass of fat? 
JOEY: What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech? 
ROSS: No! Do you wanna hear it? 
JOEY: Am I in it? 
ROSS: Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey. 
PHOEBE: Hello. 
ROSS: Hey! 
JOEY: Whoa! 
ROSS: Wow, hello! You look great! 
PHOEBE: Thank you! I know, though. 
ROSS: You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star. 
PHOEBE: Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny. 
CHANDLER: All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up. 
JOEY: What? 
CHANDLER: You're in my seat. 
JOEY: How is this your seat? 
CHANDLER: 'Cause I was sitting there. 
JOEY: But then you left. 
CHANDLER: Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back. 
JOEY: What's the big deal, sit somewhere else. 
CHANDLER: The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat. 
JOEY: Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo... 
ROSS: You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So.. 
CHANDLER: All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!! 
MONICA: Hi. 
ALL: Hey. 
MONICA: Ooh, Phoebe, you look great! 
PHOEBE: All right all ready. 
MONICA: Ooh, are you gonna do magic? 
ROSS: That's, that's funny. Change! 
MONICA: Hang on a second I just got in. 
ROSS: Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late. 
PHOEBE: We could not, would not want to wait. 
ROSS: Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts. 
MONICA: Has somebody been drinking my fat? 
RACHEL: You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear? 
PHOEBE: I don't know, you might be the first one. 
MONICA: Rach, did you check the machine? 
RACHEL: Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind. 
CHANDLER: Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up. 
JOEY: All right! You can have the chair. 
CHANDLER: Really! 
JOEY: Oh my, would you look at that! 
PHOEBE: "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky? 
ROSS: "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!" 
RACHEL: What?! 
ROSS: Nevermind. 
RICHARD: "Monica, it's Richard. Call me." 
MONICA: Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?! 
ROSS: It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep? 
MONICA: What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back? 
CHANDLER: Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old. 
ROSS: Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did? 
MONICA: Huh? 
ROSS: I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go. 
CHANDLER: You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! 
PHOEBE: Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys! 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Sorry Phoebe. 
JOEY: I'm so sorry. 
PHOEBE: What am I gonna do? 
ROSS: No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out humus?! What gets out humus?! 
PHOEBE: Monica, Monica, you know what gets out humus. 
MONICA: If it is a new message, what is he calling to say? 
PHOEBE: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that. 
CHANDLER: Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy. 
MONICA: So, should I call him back? 
THE GUYS: Noo! NO! 
CHANDLER: All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable. 
JOEY: Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable. 
CHANDLER: All right! 
ROSS: Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay. 
CHANDLER: All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! 
RACHEL: Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened? 
PHOEBE: Humus. I got the humus. 
RACHEL: Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket? 
PHOEBE: That won't go with this dress though. 
RACHEL: No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on. 
ROSS: No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes. 
RACHEL: Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress? 
MONICA: I called him. 
ALL: Nooo. 
MONICA: Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy? 
PHOEBE: Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place. 
MONICA: Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough. 
JOEY: Monica, how are you gonna do that? 
MONICA: I know the code to his answering machine. 
ROSS: Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing. 
RICHARD: "Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone." 
MACHINE: "You have two new messages." 
JOEY: Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.' 
MONICA: "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy." 
JOEY: Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy. 
WOMAN'S VOICE: Ola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay. 
JOEY: Now she sounded breezy. 
MONICA: He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone. 
PHOEBE: Monica, you don't know that. 
MONICA: Well, who's voice was that? 
CHANDLER: Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's. 
MONICA: Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle? 
ROSS: Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab. 
MONICA: It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle. 
RACHEL: Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?! 
ROSS: You don't, you don't know what your wearing? 
RACHEL: Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night. 
ROSS: Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you. 
CHANDLER: All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Mim, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!" 
JOEY: Okay. 
CHANDLER: What are you doing? 
JOEY: You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions. 
CHANDLER: The cushions are the essence of the chair! 
JOEY: That's right! I'm taking the essence. 
CHANDLER: Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room. 
ROSS: Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty. 
RACHEL: Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep. 
ROSS: Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep. 
RACHEL: Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days. 
PHOEBE: Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! 
RACHEL: Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight. 
PHOEBE: Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi! 
ROSS: Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing? 
RACHEL: No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you. 
CHANDLER: We used them as pillows when we went camping. 
ROSS: What? 
CHANDLER: The sheep. 
ROSS: Hey, what you do on your own time... 
JOEY: Where's my underwear?! 
ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear? 
CHANDLER: He took my essence! 
ROSS: Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now? 
JOEY: Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now. 
ROSS: Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight? 
JOEY: It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues. 
CHANDLER: Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions. 
JOEY: Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you. 
CHANDLER: What are you, what are you gonna *show* me my clothes? 
JOEY: Hey, opposite, is opposite! 
CHANDLER: He's got nothing! 
PHOEBE: Okay, I'm ready. 
ROSS AND CHANDLER: Oh, aaaah! 
PHOEBE: Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.' 
CHANDLER: What are you supporting? 
PHOEBE: Duh!! Christmas! 
ROSS: Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!! 
RACHEL: Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? 
ROSS: Just, just, just pick one! 
PHOEBE: Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys? 
RACHEL: Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants? 
ROSS: Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay. 
RACHEL: But I... 
ROSS: No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go. 
RACHEL: All right. 
ROSS: Thank you! 
MONICA: Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to. 
ROSS: It was, it was her voice. 
CHANDLER: Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place. 
MICHELLE: Ola! Hello. Hello? 
MONICA: Okay. That was her right? 
PHOEBE: Definitely. 
MONICA: See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now. 
ROSS: Yay! 
PHOEBE: I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. 
MONICA: Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that.... 
CHANDLER: You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about? 
MONICA: Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back. 
ROSS: No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick. 
MONICA: Okay, fine. 
CHANDLER: They got a phone in there, right? 
PHOEBE: Okay, we're on it. We're on it. 
ROSS: Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um. 
RACHEL: I'm not gonna gooo. 
ROSS: You're not going to go. 
RACHEL: No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. 
ROSS: How, how, um how can you not be going? 
RACHEL: I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going. 
ROSS: Um, you know, just out of curiosity... 
RACHEL: Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. 
ROSS: Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled. 
RACHEL: It's fine. 
ROSS: No, but, your-your mad. 
RACHEL: I'm not mad. 
ROSS: No. 
RACHEL: I'm just not going. 
ROSS: Your not going. 
RACHEL: Right. 
ROSS: Okay. You know that I-I have to go. 
RACHEL: Um, hum. 
ROSS: Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.' 
RACHEL: No. 
ROSS: No, because your not upset. 
RACHEL: Right. 
ROSS: About the yelling. 
RACHEL: Right, and the humiliating. 
ROSS: Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay. 
RACHEL: Um, hum. 
ROSS: We're good. 
RACHEL: Right. 
ROSS: Okay. Honey? 
RACHEL: Yes, Ross. 
ROSS: I love you. 
PHOEBE: Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed. 
CHANDLER: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that? 
JOEY: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. 
CHANDLER: Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!! 
JOEY: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I *be* wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando... 
CHANDLER: Oooo-ooh! 
JOEY: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
ROSS: Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party! 
CHANDLER: Jeez, what a baby. 
JOEY: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed. 
ROSS: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there. 
JOEY: You could drink the fat. 
ROSS: Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation. 
RACHEL: No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting. 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I think you *should* drink the fat. 
JOEY: Yaaaay! 
ROSS: Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do. 
PHOEBE: Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out. 
ROSS: I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. 
RACHEL: No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go! 
ROSS: You will?! 
RACHEL: You were really gonna do that, weren't you? 
ROSS: Well, yeah. 
RACHEL: You were gonna drink the fat. 
JOEY: Let's see what else he'll do! 
ROSS: How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica! 
CHANDLER: Stop it. Stop it! 
PHOEBE: Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no! 
RICHARD: Hi, this is Richard. 
MACHINE: You have three new messages. 
MONICA: Not any more! 
MACHINE: Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone. 
MONICA: Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye. 
MACHINE: Your outgoing message has now been changed. 
MONICA: Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!! 
MONICA: "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!! 
PHOEBE: How did you do that? 
MONICA: I don't know! 
MACHINE: Good-bye. 
MONICA: Noooo!!!! 
ROSS: Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go! 
MONICA: Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself. 
ROSS: Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow! 
RACHEL: And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds. 
ROSS: So we're a little late. 
RACHEL: Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way.... 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I'm going commando, too. 
ROSS: Awwww!!! 
SHERMAN WHITFIELD: Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. 
ROSS: Wow! What a pleasure. 
WHITFIELD: Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written. 
CHANDLER: Excuse me. Hi. 
WHITFIELD: Yes? 
CHANDLER: Well, your kind of sitting in my seat. 
WHITFIELD: What do you mean, your seat? 
CHANDLER: I mean, I was sitting there. 
WHITFIELD: But, you got up! 
CHANDLER: But, I never left the room! 
WHITFIELD: But, you left the chair area. 
CHANDLER: All right, that's it, give me your underwear. 
JOEY: WHOAA!! 
CHANDLER: See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed. 
MONICA: Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. 
ROSS: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning? 
MONICA: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale. 
RACHEL: I didn't know there were docks. 
JOEY: Hey. 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
ROSS: Aww, is it broken? 
JOEY: No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. 
RACHEL: Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed? 
JOEY: Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. 
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket. 
JOEY: What is this? Fruit? 
RACHEL: Monica's making jam. 
JOEY: Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? 
CHANDLER: Because the kids need new shoes. 
MONICA: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. 
JOEY: This will just be my batch. 
PHOEBE: Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you. 
GUY: You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters.... 
PHOEBE: What? 
GUY: One more chance Ursula, please? 
PHOEBE: Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. 
GUY: Wh.. 
PHOEBE: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously. 
GUY: Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus! 
PHOEBE: Oh, you're not a dingus. 
GUY: I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones. 
PHOEBE: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay. 
GUY: Well thanks. 
PHOEBE: Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying? 
GUY: Not really. 
PHOEBE: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay. 
GUY: Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here 
PHOEBE: Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee? 
GUY: Yeah, okay. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more. 
GUY: Sorry. 
RACHEL: Mon? 
ROSS: Mon? 
RACHEL: 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.' 
ROSS: Wait a minute, look. 
RACHEL: What? 
ROSS: Look, look, look. 
RACHEL: What, what, what? 
ROSS: It's an empty apartment. 
RACHEL: Oooh. 
ROSS: We're all alone in an empty apartment. 
RACHEL: Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. 
ROSS: There it is. 
RACHEL: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey. 
ROSS: Hey. 
CHANDLER: Do I look fat? 
ROSS AND RACHEL: Noo. 
CHANDLER: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow. 
RACHEL: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it. 
CHANDLER: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her.... 
ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter? 
RACHEL: Nooo! 
ROSS: And it works both ways. 
CHANDLER: Okay, so you both just know this stuff? 
RACHEL: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on. 
ROSS: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do? 
CHANDLER: That's easy, baggage claim. 
ROSS: Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her. 
CHANDLER: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something. 
RACHEL: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work. 
ROSS: Oh. 
RACHEL: All right are you guys gonna come down? 
ROSS: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you. 
RACHEL: Good luck Chandler. 
CHANDLER: Thank you Rachel. 
ROSS: Bye sweetie. 
RACHEL: Bye hon. 
ROSS: Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do. 
CHANDLER: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers. 
ROSS: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed... 
CHANDLER: Yeah. 
ROSS: I'm gonna use the cushion. 
CHANDLER: Yeah. 
ROSS: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you. 
CHANDLER: Okay, the old hug and roll. 
ROSS: Yep. 
CHANDLER: Okay, one question. 
ROSS: Shoot. 
CHANDLER: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right? 
JOEY: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? 
RACHEL: You're so pretty. 
PHOEBE: Hi! 
ALL: Hey, Phoebe. 
PHOEBE: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today. 
JOEY: You talked to him. Are you crazy? 
PHOEBE: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order. 
CHANDLER: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom. 
PHOEBE: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute. 
ROSS: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker. 
PHOEBE: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her. 
JOEY: Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean 
PHOEBE: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather. 
MONICA: Hey guys. 
ALL: Hey Mon. 
MONICA: Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin. 
JOEY: Aww. Ohh! 
CHANDLER: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. 
JOEY: Put your hands together. 
MONICA: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch. 
JOEY: No more jam?! 
RACHEL: Well, what happened to your jam plan? 
MONICA: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies. 
CHANDLER: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars. 
ROSS: What are you talking about? 
MONICA: I'm talking about me having a baby. 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: Are you serious? 
MONICA: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan. 
ROSS: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad! 
MONICA: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. 
CHANDLER: That, that's what's stupid. 
MONICA: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff. 
RACHEL: Down at the docks again? 
JANICE: Night-night Bing-a-ling. 
CHANDLER: Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' 
MALCOM: Here's my binoculars. 
PHOEBE: Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going. 
MALCOM: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun. 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah. What's this? 
MALCOM: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it? 
PHOEBE: Um, not even a little bit. 
MALCOM: It's about you. 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay then. 
MALCOM: I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool. 
PHOEBE: Good. So what were you thinking? 
MALCOM: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you. 
PHOEBE: Really? 
MALCOM: No. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
MALCOM: See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you. 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay. 
CHANDLER: No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard. 
MONICA: Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis. 
CHANDLER: You mean there's more than one of us. 
ROSS: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna..... 
MONICA: You're gonna what? 
ROSS: I'm gonna tell Mom. 
RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy. 
ROSS: Crazy. 
MONICA: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something.... 
ROSS: Oh, it's not the ideal way... 
MONICA: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know? 
JOEY: Check it out!! Jam crackers! 
MONICA: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!' 
JOEY: Yeah, the Knicks rule! 
MONICA: Joey, this is you! 
JOEY: Let me see. Oh, right. 
RACHEL: When did you go to a sperm bank? 
JOEY: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday? 
CHANDLER: And that's how you bought it? 
JOEY: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left. 
MONICA: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here. 
JOEY: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little. 
PHOEBE: Hellooo! 
ALL: Hey. 
ROSS: How's the maniac? 
PHOEBE: Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'. 
RACHEL: Phoebe, what are you doing? 
PHOEBE: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me. 
RACHEL: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that. 
PHOEBE: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. 
ROSS: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles? 
PHOEBE: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? 
CHANDLER: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order. 
PHOEBE: What are you saying I should do? 
MONICA: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him. 
PHOEBE: Thank you, Monica. 
JOEY: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes. 
MONICA: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine. 
RACHEL: Oh my God, what happened? 
JANICE: Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed! 
RACHEL: Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun. 
JANICE: Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing. 
RACHEL: Ross's what? 
JANICE: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God. 
MALCOM: Phoebe? 
PHOEBE: Yes? Yes! Oh. 
MALCOM: What are you doing? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. 
MALCOM: Were you following me? 
PHOEBE: Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister. 
MALCOM: So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. 
PHOEBE: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train? 
MALCOM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic. 
PHOEBE: No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch. 
MALCOM: Uh-huh, I don't know. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go? 
JOEY: Hey. 
MONICA: Hey. 
JOEY: Where you going? 
MONICA: To the bank. 
JOEY: Sperm or regular? 
MONICA: Sperm. 
JOEY: So you're really doing this, huh? 
MONICA: Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 
JOEY: Sounds nice. 
MONICA: 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes... 
JOEY: No kiddin', hmm. 
MONICA: What? 
JOEY: No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy. 
MONICA: Really? Why? 
JOEY: I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt. 
MONICA: Hoyt? 
JOEY: It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool. 
MONICA: Really, is he a swimmer? 
JOEY: He's got the body for it. 
MONICA: I like that. What? 
JOEY: You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know. 
MONICA: We do not have one of those signs. 
JOEY: Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids. 
MONICA: Two girls and a boy? 
JOEY: Yeah! 
MONICA: And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them. 
JOEY: Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too. 
MONICA: Yeah. 
JOEY: Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. . 
JOEY: I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person. 
RACHEL: Honey, you got a little thing on your... 
JOEY: Did I get it? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
ROSS: Hello. 
RACHEL: Hello.

HOST: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open. 
JOEY: Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way! 
MIKE: And there is Kevin. 
JOEY: Can we please turn this off? 
RACHEL: Noo way, Kevin. 
MIKE: There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000. 
ROSS: Are you intrigued? 
CHANDLER: You're flingin'-flangin' right I am! 
MIKE: Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton. 
JOEY: Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday. 
CHANDLER: Well, it's official there are no good movies. 
JANICE: Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. 
MONICA: Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back. 
JOEY: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
CHANDLER: Hey, man. What's up? 
JOEY: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?! 
CHANDLER: Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me. 
PHOEBE: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me! 
JOEY: How is it you? 
PHOEBE: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. 
JOEY: Yep, that's my audition. 
MONICA: See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere. 
PHOEBE: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play. 
JANICE: What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment. 
JOEY: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance. 
PHOEBE: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault. 
JOEY: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents. 
PHOEBE: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh . 
JOEY: What, what are you doing? What are you doing? 
PHOEBE: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.' 
JOEY: Hang up, hang up. 
PHOEBE: 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.' 
CHANDLER: Is anybody else scared? 
PHOEBE: 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen. 
CHANDLER: Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad! 
MONICA: Oh, now you want a pad. 
CAROL AND SUSAN: Hey!! 
ROSS: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi? 
CAROL: He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it. 
SUSAN: He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret. 
ROSS: Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again? 
SUSAN: So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business. 
CAROL: This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it? 
ROSS: You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I. 
ROSS: Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? 
RACHEL: Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll? 
MONICA: I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob? 
JOEY: I love that movie. 
MONICA: There it is. Joey, what are you doing? 
JOEY: I'm sorry, it just felt nice. 
CHANDLER: Joe. Joe! Answer the phone. 
JOEY: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater. 
CHANDLER: Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight. 
RACHEL: What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice? 
CHANDLER: Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes. 
ROSS: And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata? 
CHANDLER: Noo. 
ROSS: You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you. 
CHANDLER: No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!' 
RACHEL: Men are unbelievable. 
MONICA: What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away? 
CHANDLER: I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid. 
MONICA: Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you. 
JOEY: Hey, you know about that?! 
CHANDLER: Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side! 
ROSS: Where there is no fear of commitment. 
CHANDLER: Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here? 
JOEY: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was. 
RACHEL: Amazingly, that makes sense. 
CHANDLER: You think? 
JOEY: Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way. 
PHOEBE: Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again? 
RACHEL: Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents. 
JOEY: Come on baby, come on! 
PHOEBE: 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.' 
RACHEL: Very nice touch. 
PHOEBE: 'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel. 
RACHEL: Unbelievable. 
JOEY: Thank you so much. 
PHOEBE: It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before. 
JOEY: You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in. 
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time. 
JOEY: Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two. 
PHOEBE: Two? 
JOEY: Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you. 
PHOEBE: Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right 
JOEY: Nooo, four. 
JANICE: So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight? 
CHANDLER: 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. 
JANICE: Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper. 
CHANDLER: Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser. 
JANICE: Oh, you didn't have to do this. 
CHANDLER: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. 
JANICE: Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer. 
CHANDLER: Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip. 
JANICE: We should? 
CHANDLER: Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents! 
JANICE: I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay? 
CHANDLER: I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay. 
JANICE: You probably want us to move in together? 
CHANDLER: It doesn't scare me! 
JANICE: Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um... 
CHANDLER: Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. 
RACHEL: Honey, this will help. 
CHANDLER: So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down. 
RACHEL AND MONICA: Uff. 
MONICA: That is never good. 
CHANDLER: Then I got all needy and clingy. 
RACHEL: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it? 
CHANDLER: She said she'd call me. 
RACHEL AND MONICA: Ohh! 
CHANDLER: Oh God. 
MONICA: Welcome to our side of the tunnel. 
CHANDLER: This ice cream tastes like crap by the way. 
RACHEL: Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases. 
MONICA: You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat. 
RACHEL: Yeah, you do. 
CHANDLER: So, you don't think I'm terminal? 
MONICA: Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control. 
CHANDLER: Okay, okay. So, should I call her? 
RACHEL AND MONICA: Nooo! 
RACHEL: This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof. 
MONICA: She has to know that your not ready. 
RACHEL: Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof. 
CHANDLER: So I'm not, not gonna lose her? 
RACHEL: Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser. 
CHANDLER: I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?' 
RACHEL: Oh. 
ROSS: Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi. 
RACHEL: G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that? 
JOEY: G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play? 
ROSS: Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas! 
JOEY AND ROSS: Go Joe!!! 
PHOEBE: Helloo! Oh! 
JOEY: Pheebs! There you are! 
PHOEBE: No it's not, sorry. 
JOEY: But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants. 
JOEY: Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it. 
PHOEBE: Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
JOEY: It's okay, these things happen. 
PHOEBE: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. 
JOEY: I'm, I'm okay. See. 
PHOEBE: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit. 
JOEY: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally. 
PHOEBE: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent. 
JOEY: They actually said that? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I... 
JOEY: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent. 
PHOEBE: Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah. 
ROSS: You'll never get me, Joe!!! 
JANICE: No, thank you. Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Hello, Janice. 
JANICE: What are you doing here? 
CHANDLER: Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been? 
JANICE: Are you being British?! 
CHANDLER: No. Not anymore. 
JANICE: Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. 
JANICE: Barley? What kind of party serves barley? 
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours. 
JANICE: Where is this party? 
CHANDLER: Here in Chelsea. 
JANICE: Who's party is it? 
CHANDLER: A woman's 
JANICE: What woman?! 
CHANDLER: Chelsea. 
JANICE: Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? 
CHANDLER: Can I be that guy? 
PHOEBE: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. 
JOEY: Okay, shoot. 
PHOEBE: Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial. 
JOEY: I didn't get it? 
PHOEBE: No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that. 
JOEY: Okay, what else? 
PHOEBE: Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb'. 
JOEY: Oh. 
PHOEBE: Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.' 
JOEY: Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
JOEY: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, no, I understand. 
JOEY: You do, thanks. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. Sorry. 
JOEY: Wait a minute. 
PHOEBE: What? 
JOEY: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent. 
PHOEBE: Oh, you caught me. I am so busted. 
JOEY: That's-ah what I suspected-ah. 
CHANDLER: ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store. 
MONICA: My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'. 
CHANDLER: I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right? 
RACHEL: Yeah, it is. 
MONICA: You know what, everything's gonna be okay. 
CHANDLER: Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do? 
RACHEL: Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented. 
MONICA: If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call. 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: Hello! 
MONICA: Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy. 
RACHEL: Yes, and grumpy. 
CHANDLER: What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?! 
RACHEL: He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now. 
CHANDLER: I love you too. 
MONICA: Aw, it's soo unfair. 
CAROL: G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?! 
ROSS: Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose. 
SUSAN: What'd you do, dip it in sugar? 
ROSS: Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.' 
MONICA: What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman. 
ROSS: What? 
MONICA: Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time. 
ROSS: What are you talking about? 
MONICA: The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag. 
ROSS: Okay, you are totally making this up. 
MONICA: How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. 
ROSS: Oh God. 
SUSAN: I've literally never been this happy. 
MONICA: Wasn't there a little song? 
CAROL: Oh please God, let there be a song. 
ROSS: There was no song. There was no song! 
MONICA: 'I am Bea.' 
ROSS: Okay. 
MONICA: 'I drink tea.' 
ROSS: Okay, that's, that's enough. 
MONICA: '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... ' 
ROSS: Won't you dance around with me. 
MONICA: A-ha!!! 
YOUNG ROSS: 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh! 
YOUNG MONICA: Ross!!! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off? 
JOEY: No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail. 
CHANDLER: Yeah! 
JOEY: Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step. 
CHANDLER: You're building a post office? 
JOEY: No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max. 
CHANDLER: Okay. My word! Those are snug. 
JOEY: Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's. 
JOEY: Power saw kinda got away from me there. 
RACHEL: Hey Pheebs. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
RACHEL: Any sign of your brother? 
PHOEBE: No, but he's always late. 
RACHEL: I thought you only met him once? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.' 
RACHEL: Well relax, he'll be here. 
PHOEBE: No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me. 
RACHEL: Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing. 
CHANDLER: Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute? 
MONICA: No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox. 
CHANDLER: All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list. 
JOEY: Her what? 
CHANDLER: Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad. 
ROSS: Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities. 
MONICA: So, Chandler, who's on your list? 
CHANDLER: Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit. 
RACHEL: Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league? 
CHANDLER: I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head. 
JOEY: Hey, Monica, who would yours be? 
MONICA: First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list. 
JOEY: It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you? 
RACHEL: Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson. 
ROSS: Spiderman? 
RACHEL: Hardy Boy. 
CHANDLER: Peter Parker. 
ROSS: Thank you. 
RACHEL: What about you honey, who would be on your list? 
ROSS: Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories.... 
CHANDLER: What a geek! 
PHOEBE: Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank. 
ALL: Oh, hi. 
PHOEBE: This is everybody. This is Ross. 
FRANK: How are you? 
ROSS: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Chandler. 
CHANDLER: Hi. 
FRANK: Hi. 
PHOEBE: Joey. 
JOEY: Hey-hey! 
FRANK: Hey. 
PHOEBE: This is Monica. 
FRANK: Whoa! 
PHOEBE: And this is Rachel. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
FRANK: Whoa!! 
PHOEBE: I'm gonna get coffee. 
FRANK: Hey, how do you guys get anything done? 
CHANDLER: We don't, really. 
RACHEL: Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans? 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything. 
FRANK: Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. 
CHANDLER: You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city. 
JOEY: I know. 
JOEY: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya? 
CHANDLER: No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!! 
JOEY: Calm down, do you want this unit or not? 
CHANDLER: I do NOT want this unit!! 
JOEY: Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's. 
CHANDLER: Fine! 
MONICA: Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982? 
JOEY: Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor. 
MONICA: Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor? 
JOEY: Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all. 
MONICA: I highly doubt that. 
JOEY: Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah. 
MONICA: I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? 
JOEY: Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off. 
MONICA: That's a little more than I wanted to see. 
JOEY: Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. 
MONICA: I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor. 
JOEY: Eh! There you go. 
MONICA: You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon! 
PHOEBE: Oh, ew! 
FRANK: What? 
PHOEBE: Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad. 
FRANK: What, wait, you mean like this? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. 
FRANK: Your not doing it. 
PHOEBE: Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that.... 
FRANK: When's your birthday? 
PHOEBE: Feburary 16th. 
FRANK: I know a guy who's the 18th. 
PHOEBE: Wow, that's close. When's yours? 
FRANK: October 25th. 
PHOEBE: That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home? 
FRANK: Melt stuff. 
ROSS: Okay, I've got three of my five. 
RACHEL: Three of your five, what? 
ROSS: Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with. 
RACHEL: Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. 
ROSS: Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left. 
CHANDLER: All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? 
ROSS: Okay, Elizabeth Hurely.... 
CHANDLER: Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. 
ROSS: Susan Sarandon. 
CHANDLER: Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. 
ROSS: And!! Isabella Rosselini. 
CHANDLER: Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around. 
RACHEL: So? 
CHANDLER: So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time. 
RACHEL: Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography. 
PHOEBE: Okay so, by melting, you meant melting. 
FRANK: Yeah. 
PHOEBE: So is it like art? 
FRANK: Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone? 
PHOEBE: Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom? 
FRANK: No, I wanna melt it. 
PHOEBE: Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache. 
FRANK: Yeah! 
PHOEBE: G'night, bro. 
FRANK: G'night. 
PHOEBE: Here. Y'know, just in case. 
FRANK: Oh, excellent. 
MONICA: What kind of karate is that? 
PHOEBE: No kind. He just makes it up. 
MONICA: So how's it going with you guys? 
PHOEBE: So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and.... 
MONICA: Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head. 
PHOEBE: Ah!! 
MONICA: Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game. 
PHOEBE: Oh, how do you play the shadow game? 
MONICA: Oh, how do you play the shadow game? 
PHOEBE: I just asked you. 
MONICA: I just asked you. 
PHOEBE: I don't have time for this. 
MONICA: No, that is what the game is. 
PHOEBE: Which you just gave up really quickly. 
CHANDLER: Have you seen Joey? 
MONICA: What's the matter? 
CHANDLER: Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish. 
JOEY: Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles. 
CHANDLER: What's going on? 
MONICA: He's retiling my floor. 
CHANDLER: Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up! 
MONICA: Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it. 
CHANDLER: He started mine first! 
PHOEBE: Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly. 
FRANK: Whoa! Big octopus. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um. 
FRANK: Hey, what kind of work do you do? 
PHOEBE: Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff. 
FRANK: You-you work at one of those massage parlors? 
PHOEBE: Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah! 
FRANK: Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea. 
PHOEBE: All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me? 
FRANK: You mean like watch? 
PHOEBE: No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for? 
FRANK: Well, I don't think this, y'know. 
PHOEBE: No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited? 
FRANK: Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there? 
MONICA: It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for? 
CHANDLER: What, like a number? 
ROSS: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hi! Bye! 
ROSS: Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final. 
RACHEL: Well, it's about time. 
JOEY: Ooh, very official. 
ROSS: Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer. 
MONICA: And who laminated it? 
ROSS: That would be me. 
RACHEL: All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? 
ROSS: Hey, it's my list. 
RACHEL: Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice. 
FRANK: Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow! 
PHOEBE: Hey!-Hey! What's going on? 
FRANK: She broke my arm. 
GIRL: He touched my fanny. 
FRANK: No, she touched mine first! 
GIRL: That's my job! 
FRANK: So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you? 
PHOEBE AND GIRL: Ewww!!! 
PHOEBE: You can't have sex with her! 
GIRL: What'd you think I was, a hooker? 
FRANK: No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop. 
PHOEBE: Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes. 
JASMINE: Fine. I don't like you! 
PHOEBE: So that's what you thought I did! God! That's not what I do! 
FRANK: Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do? 
PHOEBE: Nooo! Why would you think that? 
FRANK: I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know. 
PHOEBE: Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways. 
FRANK: Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad. 
PHOEBE: You really thought it was perfect? 
FRANK: Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you? 
FRANK: Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes... 
PHOEBE: I don't.... 
FRANK: How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt. 
PHOEBE: Right, okay, um-mm. 
FRANK: Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I guess I do, yeah. 
FRANK: Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me. 
PHOEBE: Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know. 
FRANK: You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry. 
PHOEBE: Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this. 
FRANK: This? 
PHOEBE: Uh-huh. 
FRANK: Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker... 
PHOEBE: She wasn't a hooker. 
FRANK: Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. 
CHANDLER: Okay, on three. One....Two.... 
JOEY: Why don't we just go on two. 
CHANDLER: Why two? 
JOEY: Because it's faster. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk. 
RACHEL: Oh! 
JOEY: All right, but in the future... 
ROSS: Okay!! Okay!! 
RACHEL: Come on! 
ROSS: Heavy thing, not getting lighter! 
CHANDLER: Okay, one...two... 
JOEY: So we are going on two? 
ALL: All right!! 
CHANDLER: Oh, good job Joe. 
JOEY: Wow, it's big! 
CHANDLER: Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! 
JOEY: Maybe, my ruler's wrong. 
PHOEBE: Maybe all the rulers are wrong. 
JOEY: Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? 
JOEY: Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet. 
RACHEL: Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak. 
ROSS: Thank you. 
ISABELLA: Um, coffee to go, please. 
ROSS: Isabella Rosselini. 
MONICA: Are you serious? Oh my God. 
ROSS: Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list. 
MONICA: Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it? 
ROSS: Yeah, maybe. 
RACHEL: Oh-oh, you lie. 
ROSS: What you don't think I'd go up to her? 
RACHEL: Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. 
ROSS: Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. 
RACHEL: You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate. 
ROSS: Okay, hold my crawler. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
MONICA: Rach, are you really gonna let him do this? 
RACHEL: Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn. 
ROSS: Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one? 
ISABELLA: Aren't you with that girl over there? 
ROSS: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery. 
ISABELLA: I'm sorry. 
ROSS: Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... 
ISABELLA: Yeah, for you. Is that the list? 
ROSS: Um, yeah. 
ISABELLA: May I see it? 
ROSS: Um, no. 
ISABELLA: Come on! 
ROSS: But, okay. 
ISABELLA: I'm not on the list! 
ROSS: Um, see, but that's not the final draft. 
ISABELLA: It's laminated! 
ROSS: Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local. 
ISABELLA: Y'know it's ironic... 
ROSS: What? 
ISABELLA: ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. 
ROSS: We're just gonna be friends. 
JOEY: Y'know what? 
CHANDLER: Umm? 
JOEY: I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there. 
CHANDLER: I've got five bucks says you can't. 
JOEY: Get out your checkbook, mister. 
CHANDLER: Oh, I think I have the cash. 
JOEY: You are dogged man! I totally fit! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go. 
JOEY: Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me! 
JANICE: Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you? 
PHOEBE: Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem. 
ROSS: I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us. 
JANICE: Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid. 
JOEY: Well, that’s really a different question. 
JANICE: I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies. 
JOEY: Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together. 
MONICA AND RACHEL: What?!! 
RACHEL: Excuse me, there was no time! 
JOEY: Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go? 
JANICE: Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost? 
RACHEL: Does anybody need more coffee? 
ROSS: Yeah, I’ll take some. 
JOEY: Hey, there’s a dog out there! 
PHOEBE: Oh, that is so unfortunate. 
ROSS: What? 
PHOEBE: Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight. 
MONICA: Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone. 
PHOEBE: You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone. 
MONICA: Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. 
PHOEBE: Bye-bye! That’s why I moved out. 
ROSS: Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore. 
PHOEBE: I think on some levels she already knows. 
ROSS: Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now. 
PHOEBE: Okay, well maybe not on those levels. 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
ROSS: Hey. 
CHANDLER: I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever. 
PHOEBE: Why, nobody good? 
CHANDLER: Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing! 
ROSS: So how many more do you have tomorrow? 
CHANDLER: Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’ 
MONICA: Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more! 
ROSS: Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices. 
MONICA: What? 
ROSS: I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo... 
CHANDLER: Umm, how’s it going with you guys? 
ROSS: Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately. 
PHOEBE: Oh, really? 
ROSS: Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference 
CHANDLER: Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do? 
ERIC: Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool. 
CHANDLER: Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know...... never. 
ERIC: Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star. 
CHANDLER: Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. All right. 
CHANDLER: Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye. 
JOEY: Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions? 
CHANDLER: Sure. Ummm. What’s up? 
JOEY: Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing. 
CHANDLER: What gay thing? 
JOEY: Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that. 
CHANDLER: Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by. 
MONICA: Hi. 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey, Mon. 
MONICA: Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks. 
CHANDLER: Do I ever. 
MONICA: Chris says they’re closing down the bar. 
CHANDLER: No way! 
MONICA: Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place. 
CHANDLER: Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now? 
MONICA: Got me. 
CHANDLER: Can I get a beer. 
MONICA: Hey, did you pick a roommate? 
CHANDLER: You betcha! 
MONICA: Is it the Italian guy? 
CHANDLER: Um-mm, yeah right! 
MONICA: He’s so cute. 
CHANDLER: Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one. 
MONICA: Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt. 
CHANDLER: Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool. 
RACHEL: Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is. 
WAITRESS: I am so sorry. 
RACHEL: That’s all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh? 
FRIEND NO. 1: Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS 
RACHEL: Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. 
FRIEND NO. 2: Oh, isn’t it exciting, I mean it’s like having a boyfriend for life. 
RACHEL: Yeah, I know. 
FRIEND NO. 1: What? 
RACHEL: Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. 
FRIEND NO. 1: Rachel stop! 
FRIEND NO. 2: You’re so bad! 
RACHEL: I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some... meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see. 
CHANDLER: Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball. 
RACHEL: Yeah, so? 
CHANDLER: And now I’ve picked it up again. 
MONICA: Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi! 
RACHEL: Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? 
MONICA: Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it. 
RACHEL: Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much. 
MONICA: Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations 
RACHEL: Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody? 
MONICA: Aww, not right now. 
RACHEL: Oh, but that’s okay. 
MONICA: I know. 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
MONICA: So, I’ll get-get back to my friend. 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city? 
MONICA: Oh, that’d be great. 
RACHEL: Okay! 
MONICA: Thanks. 
RACHEL: Bye! 
MONICA: Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life. 
ROSS: No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye 
PHOEBE: So what are they doing? 
ROSS: I don’t know, something girlie. 
PHOEBE: Hey, you’re early. 
MONICA: What are you doing with the lamp? 
PHOEBE: I’m just taking it to be re-wired. 
MONICA: Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week. 
PHOEBE: No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. 
MR. HECKLES: You’re disturbing my oboe practice. 
PHOEBE: You don’t play the oboe! 
MR. HECKLES: I could play the oboe! 
PHOEBE: Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. 
MR. HECKLES: Who are you? 
ERIC: Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate. 
MR. HECKLES: I’m Chandler’s new roommate. 
ERIC: I-I-I don’t think so. 
MR. HECKLES: I could be Chandler’s new roommate. 
ERIC: But, he told me over the phone. 
MR. HECKLES: He told me in person. 
ERIC: That’s weird. 
MR. HECKLES: Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh! 
MONICA: Hi, again. 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
MONICA: Thank you soo, much. 
CHANDLER: Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work. 
MONICA: You want some help with that? 
JOEY: Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don’t! 
MONICA: Whoa! Are you okay? 
JOEY: Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush. 
MONICA: It’s the heat. And-and the humidity. 
JOEY: That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination. 
MONICA: Do you wanna come in for some lemonade? 
JOEY: Like you wouldn’t believe. Wow! This is a great place. 
MONICA: Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable. 
JOEY: Gotcha. 
MONICA: This place is really my Grandmother’s. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty? 
JOEY: Oh, you bet I am! 
MONICA: Okay, here’s your penis! 
MONICA: Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!! 
JOEY: You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? 
MONICA: So?! 
JOEY: Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade? 
MONICA: Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up! 
JOEY: Oh right, right. 
MONICA: I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex? 
JOEY: Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk. 
MONICA: It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it. 
MONICA: Pheebs? 
PHOEBE: Huh? 
MONICA: Where’s your bed? 
PHOEBE: It’s not in the apartment? Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again. 
MONICA: What? 
PHOEBE: Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore. 
MONICA: What are you talking about? 
PHOEBE: I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows! 
MONICA: Everybody knows! 
PHOEBE: That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. 
MONICA: Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side. 
MONICA: What?!?! 
PHOEBE: Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill. 
MONICA: You can spill. In the sink. 
PHOEBE: Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening. 
MONICA: I love you, too. 
PHOEBE: Aww, good. What? 
MONICA: What? I’m just said. 
PHOEBE: No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is. 
CHANDLER: So ah, whatcha watching? 
JOEY: Baywatch. 
CHANDLER: What’s it about? 
JOEY: Lifeguards. 
CHANDLER: Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who’s she? 
JOEY: Nicole Eggert. You'll like her. 
CHANDLER: Wow! Look at them run. 
JOEY: They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I’ll go get one. 
JOEY: No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here. 
CHANDLER: Well, hello! 
MONICA: Hey. 
CHANDLER: Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers. 
MONICA: Help yourself. 
CHANDLER: You okay? 
MONICA: Phoebe moved out. 
CHANDLER: Right. 
MONICA: I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend? 
CHANDLER: Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend. 
MONICA: Well, I think so. 
CHANDLER: Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life. 
ROSS: Hi. Where is everybody? 
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong? 
ROSS: My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over. 
PHOEBE: Oh no! Why? 
ROSS: ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny. 
ROSS: I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool! 
PHOEBE: Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover? 
ROSS: Well, now I do!! 
PHOEBE: I’m sorry. 
ROSS: Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever.... 
PHOEBE: Aw, God Ross. Oh. 
CHANDLER: Umm, this is nice. 
MONICA: I know, it is isn’t it? 
CHANDLER: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton? 
MONICA: Yeah! And I got it on sale, too. 
CHANDLER: Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device. 
MONICA: Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can. 
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be.... 
MONICA: I know. Thanks. 
ROSS: Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this! 
PHOEBE: I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. 
ROSS: Thanks. 
PHOEBE: And you’re so sweet. And you’re kind 
ROSS: Thanks. 
ROSS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
PHOEBE: Huh? 
PHOEBE: Okay, it’s okay. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
ROSS: Wait, wait, wait. 
PHOEBE: What? 
ROSS: My foot is stuck in the pocket. 
PHOEBE: What? 
ROSS: No, I can’t get it out. 
PHOEBE: Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear. 
ROSS: No, come on don’t start. Ouch! 
PHOEBE: What? 
ROSS: Stupid balls are in the way. 
ROSS: Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution. 
PHOEBE: You have chalk on your face. 
ROSS: Huh? 
PHOEBE: Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass. 
MONICA: Hey, are you okay? 
ROSS: My wife’s a lesbian. 
JOEY: Cool!! 
CHANDLER: Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. 
ROSS: Hi. 
CHANDLER: I can’t believe you came back. 
RACHEL: Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. 
FRIEND NO. 2: Rachel! Rachel! 
RACHEL: What? 
FRIEND NO. 2: You missed the exit! 
RACHEL: Oh, sorry. 
FRIEND NO. 1: My God, what were you thinking about? 
RACHEL: Um, Barry. 
HER FRIENDS: Awwww!! 
ROSS: So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out..... 
RACHEL: I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda. 
MONICA: Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct? 
CHANDLER: If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best. 
GUNTHER: What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife. 
PHOEBE: Who's singing? 
ROSS: Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie. 
MONICA: I was always Joanne. 
JOEY: Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood? 
PHOEBE: Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King! 
JOEY: Booo!! 
CHANDLER: Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel! 
JANICE: Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine. 
MATRESS KING: 'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices! 
CHANDLER: What a wank! 
JANICE: Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses. 
MONICA: I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way. 
MATRESS KING: I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king. 
RACHEL: 'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.' 
ROSS: We? 
RACHEL: Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay. 
ROSS: Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry. 
RACHEL: Ross, my father doesn't hate you. 
ROSS: Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'. 
RACHEL: But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like. 
CHANDLER: I'll go. 
ROSS: Fine. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
ROSS: Hi Gunther. 
GUNTHER: Yeah, we'll see! 
JOEY: Hey, you guys! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
JOEY: Guess what? 
ROSS: What? 
JOEY: I got a gig! 
ALL: Yay!! 
CHANDLER: See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God! 
MONICA: What's the part? 
JOEY: Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension. 
ROSS: Come on! That's great. 
ALL: Wow! 
JOEY: Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community. 
ROSS: Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students. 
JOEY: I know! 
PHOEBE: Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler. 
MONICA: Not at these prices. 
PHOEBE: Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo! 
MONICA: Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy. 
PHOEBE: Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends. 
JOEY: Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along. 
JOEY: Hi! 
PHOEBE: Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night? 
JOEY: Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.' 
PHOEBE: Ooooh, nice. 
JOEY: Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children. 
PHOEBE: Oh, yay! 
JOEY: Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
GUY: Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller? 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
GUY: Sign here. 
PHOEBE: Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there. 
JOEY: Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler. 
JOEY: You want me to lie to Chandler? 
PHOEBE: Is that a problem? 
JOEY: No. 
PHOEBE: Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on. 
JOEY: Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough. 
JOEY: Ahh! 
JOEY: Hey now! 
JOEY: Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding. 
PHOEBE: Oh! Oh! Oh! 
JOEY: Okay, great. 
PHOEBE: Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it. 
JOEY: Okay. 
PHOEBE: 'Kay, put your head back. 
JOEY: All right. I can't see. 
PHOEBE: All right, I have ya. Oh God. 
GUY: Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller? 
PHOEBE: Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay. 
GUY: Gotcha. 
RACHEL: Hi Daddy! 
DR. GREEN: This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby. 
RACHEL: You remember Ross. 
DR. GREEN: Um-hmm. 
ROSS: Nice to see you again Dr. Green. 
DR. GREEN: So! How's the library? 
ROSS: Ugh, museum. 
DR. GREEN: What happened to the library? 
ROSS: There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one. 
DR. GREEN: You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three. 
ROSS: Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke. 
RACHEL: Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster. 
DR. GREEN: What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library. 
ROSS: It's not a library... 
DR. GREEN: I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. 
ROSS: So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat. 
DR. GREEN: They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat? 
ROSS: It gives it a nice antiquey look. 
DR. GREEN: Rust, is boat cancer, Ross. 
ROSS: Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. 
DR. GREEN: Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Okay! 
RACHEL: Aw honey stop! It's not that bad. 
ROSS: Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent. 
RACHEL: Yeah. That's Daddy. 
ROSS: That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress. 
RACHEL: Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers. 
ROSS: So? 
RACHEL: So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change. 
ROSS: You really serve people sneezers? 
RACHEL: Well um, I don't. 
DR GREEN: You kids ready? 
ROSS: Thanks again, Dr. Green. 
DR. GREEN: All right. 
DR. GREEN: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt. 
ROSS: Oh, ah, you don't need that. 
DR. GREEN: Why not? 
ROSS: The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness. 
DR. GREEN: What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh? 
ROSS: Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really. 
RACHEL: Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that. 
ROSS: I know. 
DR. GREEN: Excuse me, you think I'm cheap? 
RACHEL: Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't. 
ROSS: Nothing I do means anything, really. 
DR. GREEN: This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. 
ROSS: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'. 
JOEY: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. 
STUDENT: Hey, Mr. Trib. 
JOEY: Hey-hey. 
STUDENT: Guess what, I got an audition! 
JOEY: Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud. 
STUDENT: I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it? 
JOEY: You bet! What's the part? 
STUDENT: Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer. 
RACHEL: You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone. 
ROSS: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food. 
RACHEL: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. 
ROSS: Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. 
ROSS: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing? 
PHOEBE: I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? 
RACHEL: Um. yeah. 
PHOEBE: I am soo dead. 
RACHEL: All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. 
ROSS: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work. 
RACHEL: Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here. 
ROSS: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!' 
RACHEL: Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? 
ROSS: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along. 
RACHEL: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! 
ROSS: Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels. 
MONICA: What's this? 
PHOEBE: Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom! 
MONICA: This is not the bed I ordered! 
PHOEBE: I know, you must've won like a contest or something! 
MONICA: Phoebe! 
MONICA: Why is this car in my bedroom? 
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it... 
MONICA: When did I sign for it? 
PHOEBE: When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open! 
MONICA: Did you make brownies today? 
CHANDLER: Knock, knock. 
MONICA: Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed. 
CHANDLER: Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp. 
PHOEBE: It's Monica's bed. What? 
CHANDLER: Okay. It's a racecar. 
PHOEBE: So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you? 
CHANDLER: Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress? 
MONICA: Sometimes I have bad dreams. 
STUDENT: Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me. 
JOEY: Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers? 
STUDENT: No. 
JOEY: Whoa. That was really good. 
STUDENT: Thanks, any suggestions? 
CHANDLER: You told him to play the boxer gay!! 
JOEY: Well, I-I might've said supergay. 
CHANDLER: You totally screwed him over. 
MONICA: Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this? 
JOEY: Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part. 
PHOEBE: Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay. 
RACHEL: Hi Daddy. 
DR. GREEN: Baby. Ross. 
ROSS: Dr. Green. How are you? 
DR. GREEN: Thanks for dinner last night. 
ROSS: Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. 
DR. GREEN: Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here? 
ROSS: Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore. 
RACHEL: What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here. 
ROSS: Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go. 
RACHEL: What?! 
ROSS: Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that.... 
DR. GREEN: Ross? What's with the neck? 
RACHEL: He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor... 
DR. GREEN: You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa! 
ROSS: Thank you! That's what I keep saying. 
RACHEL: Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. 
ROSS: Uh. 
DR. GREEN: Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby? 
RACHEL: Well that's his last name. 
ROSS: And his first name. 
DR. GREEN: He's Bobby Bobby? 
RACHEL: It's Robert Bobby. 
DR. GREEN: Oh. 
RACHEL: And um, excuse me, he helps me. 
ROSS: Oh-ho please. Ask her how? 
DR. GREEN: What do you need help for? 
RACHEL: With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other. 
DR. GREEN: Oh God! 
ROSS: Argue with that. 
RACHEL: What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter. 
DR. GREEN: Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine! 
ROSS: I know that! 
DR. GREEN: So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for? 
RACHEL: I'm sorry, let her? 
ROSS: What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either. 
DR. GREEN: Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?! 
RACHEL: No. 
DR. GREEN: Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?! 
ROSS: Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice? 
DR. GREEN: I'd love some juice. Thanks. 
ROSS: Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see? 
RACHEL: Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet. 
ROSS: Excellent! 
JOEY: There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you. 
JESTER: Uh, may I help you? 
MONICA: Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed. 
JESTER: Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller. 
JOEY: All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. 
JESTER: Nobody sees the king! 
JOEY: Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king. 
JESTER: Hey! You can't go back there! 
JANICE: Oh my God. 
CHANDLER: Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring. 
RACHEL: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
CHANDLER: I will have one. 
CHANDLER: Okay, I'm not gonna have one. 
ROSS: Neither will I. 
PHOEBE: No, no, it's just my tooth. 
CHANDLER: All right I'll have one. 
ROSS: So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one. 
PHOEBE: No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him. 
CHANDLER: See that is the problem with invisible dentists. 
ROSS: Why? Why can't you go to him? 
PHOEBE: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. 
CHANDLER: That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse. 
RACHEL: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'. 
RACHEL: And all these people actually died? 
PHOEBE: Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! 
ROSS: Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence. 
PHOEBE: Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead. 
ROSS: Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too? 
GUNTHER: Oh, like you don't already have everything. 
PHOEBE: Ow! Ow! 
RACHEL: Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go. 
PHOEBE: All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set. 
RACHEL: I promise. 
PHOEBE: Although, don't feel like you can't visit. 
JOEY: Hey, is, is, is Chandler here? 
ROSS: No, no he's not. 
MONICA: You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband. 
ROSS: What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler? 
JOEY: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not. 
RACHEL: Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him. 
JOEY: It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him. 
PHOEBE: Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him. 
JOEY: Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. 
PHOEBE: Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um...... 
ROSS: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display. 
JOEY: What did they do? 
ROSS: Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that. 
MONICA: So, do you want me to watch Ben for you? 
ROSS: Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you. 
RACHEL: Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me? 
ROSS: You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. 
JOEY: Hey-hey, Ross? 
ROSS: Yeah. 
JOEY: I've got a science question. 
ROSS: Hmm? 
JOEY: If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct? 
ROSS: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people. 
JOEY: Hey-hey, I'm not judging. 
RACHEL: Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored. 
MONICA: Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!! 
MONICA: Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave. 
RACHEL: Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?! 
MONICA: He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him. 
RACHEL: We're not?! 
MONICA: No we're not. 
RACHEL: All right, I like that. 
MONICA: Okay. 
RACHEL: So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump. 
MONICA: Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in! 
RACHEL: I cannot push it in! 
MONICA: Okay, we're gonna need a distraction. 
RACHEL: Okay, okay, okay. 
MONICA: I got it! 
RACHEL: Okay. 
MONICA: The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!! 
RACHEL: Or. We could put a hat on his head. 
MONICA: A hat! Yes! We need a hat. 
RACHEL: We need a hat.. 
MONICA: Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat? 
RACHEL: Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!! 
MONICA: Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius! 
RACHEL: Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though. 
MONICA: Give it. Give it. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
MONICA AND RACHEL: Oh!! 
RACHEL: Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today. 
CHANDLER: Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice? 
JOEY: I'd really prefer a mountain bike. 
CHANDLER: Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me. 
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum. 
CHANDLER: That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious. 
JOEY: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious. 
CHANDLER: All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever. 
JOEY: No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't. 
CHANDLER: Why not?! 
JOEY: Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is... 
CHANDLER: What is the thing? 
JOEY: Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband. 
CHANDLER: What? 
JOEY: They were in his office. 
CHANDLER: Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me. 
JOEY: I'm telling you man, I saw it. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong. 
JOEY: I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh? 
MONICA: It just makes more sense as an ensemble. 
RACHEL: Right. 
MONICA: Besides, it takes the focus off the hat. 
PHOEBE: No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive! 
RACHEL: See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know. 
MONICA: Sure, we have no money, go ahead. 
PHOEBE: 'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!' 
BEN: Monica. 
MONICA: Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that? 
BEN: Monica bang! 
RACHEL: Okay, I heard that. 
MONICA: Did he just say 'Monica bang'? 
RACHEL: Uh-huh. 
MONICA: Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out! 
BEN: Monica bang! 
MONICA: Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun? 
RACHEL: Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now. 
MONICA: You okay? 
RACHEL: Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it. 
JANICE: How's my Bing-a-ling? 
CHANDLER: Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me. 
JANICE: Why are your eyes so white? 
CHANDLER: You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!! 
JANICE: Oh my God!! 
CHANDLER: All right! 
JANICE: How did you know? 
CHANDLER: Joey told me, he saw you two kissing. 
JANICE: In the park? 
CHANDLER: No! In his office! How many kisses were there? 
JANICE: Just those two! 
CHANDLER: Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!! 
JANICE: Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something? 
CHANDLER: Here. 
JANICE: The receipt. 
CHANDLER: I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? 
JANICE: I don't know. 
PHOEBE: Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone! 
MONICA: Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident. 
RACHEL: Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?! 
JOEY: You said number two. 
RACHEL: I also said number one. 
JOEY: I know. 
ROSS: Hey! Everyone. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ROSS: How's my little boy? 
RACHEL: He's perfect, he's never been better. 
ROSS: What'd you do, take him whaling? 
BEN: Monica. 
ROSS: Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben. 
BEN: Monica bang! 
MONICA: Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded. 
PHOEBE: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive. 
JOEY: Uh. 
PHOEBE: What? 
JOEY: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big. 
RACHEL: Well maybe he's just taking a nap. 
JOEY: I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning. 
MONICA: All right, we should call somebody. 
ROSS: And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving. 
RACHEL: Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive. 
MONICA: How are we gonna do that? There's no way. 
JOEY: Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him. 
JOEY: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food? 
CHANDLER: Yeah. 
JOEY: Well, now we got a reason. 
CHANDLER: What? 
JOEY: Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device. 
CHANDLER: All right. 
JOEY: Hey uh, what's a matter? 
CHANDLER: I talked to Janice. 
JOEY: Oh my God, is she going back to him? 
CHANDLER: She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept! 
JOEY: What are you ah, what are you gonna do? 
CHANDLER: I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do? 
JOEY: Well, it doesn't matter what I would do. 
CHANDLER: Come on, tell me. 
JOEY: All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out. 
CHANDLER: What? What are you, what are you talking about? 
JOEY: They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy? 
ROSS: Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head? 
RACHEL: Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child. 
ROSS: It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could. 
RACHEL: I did! 
ROSS: I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time. 
RACHEL: I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing! 
ROSS: Monica did it? 
ROSS: Monica? 
MONICA: Yeah. 
ROSS: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today? 
MONICA: No. Why? 
ROSS: Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head. 
MONICA: Really?! 
ROSS: Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know... 
MONICA: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! 
RACHEL: I hope it's still funny when you're in hell. 
MONICA: You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! 
ROSS: Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow! 
RACHEL: I'll get the hat. 
CHANDLER: Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy. 
JANICE: Okay. 
CHANDLER: I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad. 
JANICE: Wow! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do. 
JANICE: Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together. 
CHANDLER: Then don't leave me! 
JANICE: What? 
CHANDLER: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me! 
JANICE: No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance. 
CHANDLER: No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance. 
JANICE: I'm sorry. 
CHANDLER: Ohhh. Don't go. 
JANICE: No, I-I-I gotta go. 
CHANDLER: No. No! No! No! 
JANICE: Honey, honey, people are looking. 
CHANDLER: I don't care! I don't care!! 
JANICE: Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now. 
CHANDLER: You can't leave! I have your shoe! 
JANICE: Good-bye Chandler Bing. 
GUNTHER: Rachel has those in burgendy. 
JOEY: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. 
ROSS: Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance! 
PHOEBE: I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick. 
JOEY: All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle. 
PHOEBE: He's alive! He's a-live!!! 
MONICA: And yet, we're still poking him. 
JOEY: Okay, retract the device, retract the device. 
ROSS: He does not look happy. 
RACHEL: Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device. 
JOEY: Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! 
CHANDLER: 'I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....' 
PHOEBE: 'Love....' 
CHANDLER AND PHOEBE: 'I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.' 
CHANDLER: 'No you know I don't mind.' 
CHANDLER AND PHOEBE: 'Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh..' 
CHANDLER: 'I know.' 
PHOEBE: 'I know.' 
CHANDLER: 'I've found.' 
PHOEBE: 'I've found....' 
CHANDLER AND PHOEBE: '...in you, my endless love.' 'My endless love.' 
THE GUYS: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww! 
PHOEBE: Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. 
THE GUYS: We will. 
MONICA: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles. 
RACHEL: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. 
MONICA: Every year. 
PHOEBE: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. . 
ROSS: Halftime. 
JOEY: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going? 
RACHEL: Oh! That would be sooo much fun! 
PHOEBE: Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever. 
JOEY: Great, you can cover Chandler. 
CHANDLER: No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play. 
JOEY: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up. 
CHANDLER: That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals! 
JOEY: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, all right, I'll play. 
PHOEBE: Yay!! 
RACHEL: Let's do it! Ross? 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: Do you wanna play football? 
ROSS: Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football. 
JOEY: Says who? Your mom? 
MONICA AND ROSS: Yeah. 
MONICA: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.' 
CHANDLER: No, no, no, you say that proudly. 
MONICA: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose. 
ROSS: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running. 
MONICA: To score the winning touchdown, by the way. 
ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking. 
MONICA: I won the game. 
ROSS: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup? 
RACHEL: Um, there was a Geller Cup? 
ROSS: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake. 
CHANDLER: And was the curse lifted? 
ROSS: Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again. 
MONICA: Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years. 
ROSS: Can I see you for a second? 
MONICA: Once!! 
ROSS: All right, we're gonna play. 
CHANDLER: But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street. 
MONICA: Okay. Let's bring it in. 
RACHEL: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. 
ROSS: Here you go. 
RACHEL: That almost hit me in the face. 
JOEY: All right, we have to pick captains. 
CHANDLER: And then Tineals. 
PHOEBE: Okay, so how do we decide that? 
MONICA: Well, why don't we just bunny up. 
RACHEL, CHANDLER, AND JOEY: What? 
MONICA AND ROSS: Bunny! 
MONICA: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey. 
JOEY: Thank you. 
RACHEL: Monica, I'm your best friend. 
ROSS: Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler. 
RACHEL: Ross! 
MONICA: Phoebe. 
ROSS: Sweetie, now I pick you. 
RACHEL: You don't pick me! You're stuck with me! 
ROSS: Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off. 
MONICA: All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again. 
CHANDLER: Wow! Just like in the pros. 
MONICA: Huddle up. 
JOEY: All right, huddle up, right over here. 
PHOEBE: Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle. 
MONICA: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler? 
MONICA: Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 
MONICA: Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block. 
PHOEBE: What's block? 
MONICA: Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing? 
PHOEBE: I thought you meant in life. 
MONICA: Break. 
CHANDLER: The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. 
ROSS: Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on! 
CHANDLER: Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it. 
JOEY: I got it. 
PHOEBE: Go! Go! Go! 
MONICA: Score!! 7 to nothing! 
RACHEL: Are you okay? 
ROSS: Come on, let's go! 
MONICA: Losers walk! 
ROSS: Yeah, losers talk! 
CHANDLER: No, no, no, actually losers rhyme. 
CHANDLER: Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun? 
ROSS: Yeah! 
CHANDLER: Hike! 
MONICA AND JOEY: One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi. 
RACHEL: Over here! 
RACHEL: I almost caught that one! 
CHANDLER: Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7. 
ROSS: Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break! 
RACHEL: Wait, what am I gonna do? 
ROSS: You, you go long. 
RACHEL: Wait, how long? 
ROSS: Until we start to look very small. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Break!! 
JOEY: Set....hike! 
ROSS: One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!! 
CHANDLER: No, no, no, no, no! 
JOEY: Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball. 
WOMAN: You are playing American football? 
JOEY: Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country. 
WOMAN: I'm Dutch. 
JOEY: Hi-hi, I'm Joey. 
WOMAN: I'm Margha. 
JOEY: I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit. 
CHANDLER: Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler. 
MARGHA: Hello, Chandler. 
JOEY: Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan. 
MARGHA: Margha. 
JOEY: Mar-klan. 
MARGHA: Mar-gha. 
CHANDLER: Mar-haaaan. 
MONICA: Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down. 
ROSS: Uh, hello, it's third down. 
MONICA: No it's not, it's second. 
ROSS: Wow! 
MONICA: Wow, what? 
ROSS: It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this. 
MONICA: Pulling what? It's second down. 
ROSS: Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need. 
MONICA: I heard that! 
ROSS: Well, I said it loud. 
MARGHA: It is okay, if I stay and watch? 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there. 
CHANDLER: Well, that went well. 
JOEY: I think so. 
CHANDLER: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number. 
JOEY: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know. 
CHANDLER: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about. 
JOEY: Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her. 
CHANDLER: Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot? 
JOEY: Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff. 
CHANDLER: Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her. 
ROSS: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie.. 
RACHEL: Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle. 
ROSS: Well ah, you wanna just stay out there? 
RACHEL: Can I see that for second. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
ROSS: Okay. Hut! Hike! 
JOEY: Fumble! 
JOEY: What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey. 
CHANDLER: Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math. 
JOEY: All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself. 
CHANDLER: Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean! 
MONICA: All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! 
PHOEBE: Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow! 
JOEY: Pheebs, run! 
MONICA: Run, Phoebe, run! 
PHOEBE: Touchdown!! Touchdown!! 
ROSS: Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count. 
MONICA: After the snap! 
ROSS: Before the snap! 
JOEY: After!! 
CHANDLER: Before!! 
RACHEL: Now, does it really matter? 
ALL: Yes!! 
PHOEBE: Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So? 
ROSS: Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count. 
MONICA: Does so count! 
ROSS: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! 
MONICA: Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have. 
ROSS: Oh-ho, okay. 
MONICA: Dead leg!! 
ROSS: Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win. 
PHOEBE: Woo-yay!! 
MONICA: No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime. 
ROSS: Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!! 
MONICA: Y'know what? I'll think you'll play. 
ROSS: Oh really! Why is that? 
MONICA: Because the winner gets this! 
ROSS: The Geller Cup. 
CHANDLER: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four? 
ALL: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: Okay, good. 
ROSS: Okay, where in the hell did you get that?! 
MONICA: When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. 
ROSS: That cup is mine! 
MONICA: No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it! 
RACHEL: All right, so are we not having dinner at all? 
MONICA: Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game. 
JOEY: It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl. 
MONICA: All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus? 
JOEY: What are you gonna do? 
MONICA: All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest. 
JOEY: Okay. 
MONICA: Break! 
JOEY: Here you go! 
ROSS: Chandler! Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Hi. 
MONICA: Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya? 
ROSS: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling? 
MONICA: What?! I just touched him and he went over. 
ROSS: Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough. 
PHOEBE: I love this game!! 
ROSS: Hey, where'd you get that? 
RACHEL: I went really long. 
MONICA: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done! 
ROSS: It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team. 
MONICA: You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you. 
MONICA: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game. 
ROSS: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns. 
MONICA: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls. 
ROSS: Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me. 
RACHEL: I can not believe your trading me!! 
MONICA: Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change. 
RACHEL: Are you gonna let me play? 
MONICA: All right then. 
MARGHA: The game is over, we eat now? 
CHANDLER: No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams. 
JOEY: Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team. 
ROSS: Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go. 
CHANDLER: No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from? 
JOEY: Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania. 
CHANDLER: And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right? 
JOEY: Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from. 
MARGHA: Oh, my. 
ROSS: Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys. 
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now. 
CHANDLER: Fine with me. 
ROSS: Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like? 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? 
MARGHA: Which do I like? 
ROSS: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill... 
MARGHA: Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler. 
CHANDLER: Yes!! 
JOEY: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question. 
CHANDLER: Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her. 
MARGHA: I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose. 
CHANDLER: You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! 
MARGHA: I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one. 
CHANDLER: Wh-what? 
MARGHA: I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye. 
JOEY: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook! 
ROSS: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls. 
CHANDLER: We're not gonna lose to girls. 
ROSS: Hey! It's 42-21! 
JOEY: This sucks, I was just up by that much! 
MONICA: Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries. 
MONICA: We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out... 
PHOEBE: Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?! 
MONICA: Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um! 
RACHEL: Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!! 
PHOEBE: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys? 
MONICA: All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long. 
RACHEL: No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me. 
MONICA: Honey, there's a reason. 
RACHEL: God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too. 
PHOEBE: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball. 
MONICA: All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break. 
RACHEL: Thank you! Break! 
MONICA: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike! 
THE GUYS: One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi! 
RACHEL: I'm so sorry! Are you okay? 
MONICA: No! I'm not okay! 
RACHEL: I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do. 
JOEY: Thirty seconds left on the timer! 
CHANDLER: Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home! 
MONICA: Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up! 
PHOEBE: Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah. 
MONICA: All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
MONICA: Break! 
RACHEL: I got a touchdown! We did it!! 
CHANDLER: Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win! 
PHOEBE: Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going. 
ROSS: Let go! Let go! 
MONICA: Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!! 
CHANDLER: Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!! 
MONICA: Ow!! 
RACHEL: We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something. 
PHOEBE: Isn't there a national football league. 
CHANDLER: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights. 
RACHEL: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights. 
PHOEBE: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some? 
JOEY: When they're hungry enough, they'll come in. 
MONICA: Let go! 
ROSS: No! You let go! 
MONICA: No! 
ROSS: How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball? 
MONICA: I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough. 
ROSS: Hey! It's starting to snow. 
ROSS: Gimme the this! 
MONICA: Let go! 
CHANDLER: Eh..., I don't, I don't know. 
RACHEL: What? 
CHANDLER: Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing? 
GUNTHER: Rachel? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
GUNTHER: Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress? 
RACHEL: Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new? 
GUNTHER: Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever. 
RACHEL: Eh, do you believe that? 
CHANDLER: Yeah? 
SARAH: So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. 
ROSS: Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand. 
CHANDLER: Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand. 
ROSS: Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand. 
CHANDLER: I was shrieking... like a Marine. 
ROSS: All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache. 
MONICA: You broke a little girl's leg?!! 
ROSS: I know. I feel horrible. Okay. 
CHANDLER: Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were you around ten-ish? 
ROSS: Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like? 
MONICA: Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk... 
RACHEL: I'm gonna get back to retraining. 
ROSS: All right, see you guys. 
CHANDLER: Look out kids, he's coming! 
JOEY: And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees. 
PHOEBE: Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now. 
JOEY: What? Me having a job? 
PHOEBE: No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night? 
JOEY: Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy. 
PHOEBE: Really? 
CHANDLER: Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York. 
GUNTHER: ...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray.... 
RACHEL: Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. 
GUNTHER: What if you put them here. 
RACHEL: Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too. 
GUNTHER: They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.' 
RACHEL: Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry. 
GUNTHER: It's all right. Sweetheart. 
ROSS: So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore. 
SARAH: Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. 
ROSS: Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh? 
SARAH: Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. 
ROSS: I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India. 
SARAH: No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me. 
ROSS: Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? 
SARAH: The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
SARAH: So far, I've sold seventy-five. 
ROSS: Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes? 
SARAH: Five dollars a box. 
ROSS: And what is second prize? 
SARAH: A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell. 
ROSS: Well, that makes sense. 
SARAH: Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble? 
ROSS: Yeah, Sarah, anything. 
SARAH: Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it. 
WOMAN: Yesss? 
ROSS: Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies. 
WOMAN: You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole. 
ROSS: No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird 
WOMAN: What does that mean? 
ROSS: Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs. 
WOMAN: I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away! 
ROSS: No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world. 
WOMAN: I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way. 
ROSS: Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going. 
WOMAN: I can still see you! 
ROSS: All right!! 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
JOEY: Hey. What, what are you doing here? 
PHOEBE: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh... 
JOEY: Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas.... 
PHOEBE: Destiny. 
JOEY: Sure. 
PHOEBE: Yes. 
JOEY: All right. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled. 
JOEY: Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back. 
PHOEBE: You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist. 
JOEY: Well we have to make room for the fresh ones. 
PHOEBE: So, what happens to the old guys? 
JOEY: Well, they go into the chipper. 
PHOEBE: Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!! 
JOEY: Hey! Hey!! 
ROSS: ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus. 
JOEY: All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's. 
ROSS: Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you? 
CHANDLER: Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities? 
ROSS: No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night. 
ROSS: Mon? 
MONICA: All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all? 
ROSS: Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's. 
MONICA: No. 
ROSS: Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em. 
MONICA: Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this. 
ROSS: I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free. 
MONICA: Oh God! I gotta go! 
ROSS: Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em! 
GUNTHER: And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there. 
RACHEL: I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks. 
JOEY: Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff? 
RACHEL: Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that. 
CHANDLER: How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago? 
RACHEL: Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts. 
JOEY: If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear. 
RACHEL: The fear? 
CHANDLER: He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want. 
RACHEL: Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'? 
CHANDLER: Because, I'm too afraid. 
RACHEL: I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here. 
GUNTHER: Rachel? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
GUNTHER: Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular. 
RACHEL: Can't I just look at the handles on them? 
GUNTHER: You would think. 
RACHEL: Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice. 
GUNTHER: What?! 
RACHEL: Gunther, I quit. 
CHANDLER: Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee? 
ROSS: ....and 12, 22, 18, four... What? 
CHANDLER: I spelled out boobies. 
MONICA: Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures? 
ROSS: Ah, we're out. I sold them all. 
MONICA: What? 
ROSS: Monica, I'm cutting you off. 
MONICA: No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes! 
ROSS: Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck. 
MONICA: Oh God! 
CHANDLER: So, how many have you sold so far? 
ROSS: Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes! 
CHANDLER: Oh my God, how did you do that? 
ROSS: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!' 
RACHEL: Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers..... 
ROSS: Well hey, who did these resumes for ya? 
CHANDLER: Me! On my computer. 
ROSS: Well you sure used a large font. 
CHANDLER: Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room. 
RACHEL: Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?! 
CHANDLER: Something else I might have said? 
RACHEL: I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!! 
ROSS: Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay. 
RACHEL: No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting. 
CHANDLER: You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear. 
RACHEL: You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear.... 
JOEY: Hey! I got great news! 
CHANDLER: Run, Joey! Run for your life! 
JOEY: What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions? 
RACHEL: No. 
JOEY: Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview? 
RACHEL: Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey. 
JOEY: Not a problem. 
RACHEL: Thanks. 
JOEY: And now for the great news. 
ROSS: What, that wasn't the great news? 
JOEY: Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie. 
MONICA: Christmas cookie? 
JOEY: Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell. 
GUY: Looks good. I'll take it. 
PHOEBE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. 
GUY: It's-it's-it's almost dead! 
PHOEBE: Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey 
JOEY: Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper. 
GUY: I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more. 
JOEY: Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here. 
MONICA: Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree. 
PHOEBE: Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh. 
MONICA: Is this the one that I threw out last year? 
PHOEBE: All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard. 
MONICA: Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that. 
MONICA: Oh. 
ROSS: Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell? 
GIRL: I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg. 
ROSS: Hey now! That was an accident, okay. 
GIRL: You're a big scrud. 
ROSS: What's a scrud? 
GIRL: Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud. 
ROSS: I don't have too. I can just look at you. 
LEADER: All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice. 
ROSS: Not nice enough. 
LEADER: Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good. 
ROSS: Good for a scrud. 
LEADER: Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871. 
ROSS: That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going. 
LEADER: Who's next? 
ROSS: Hi there! 
LEADER: Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself. 
ROSS: Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency. 
CHANDLER: Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross. 
ROSS: Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes. 
CHANDLER: Hey! How'd the interview go? 
RACHEL: Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me. 
ROSS: Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out. 
PHOEBE: This is the worst Christmas ever. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house. 
RACHEL: I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans. 
ROSS: That word was swans. 
CHANDLER: Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas. 
PHOEBE: Oh! Oh my God! 
JOEY AND MONICA: Merry Christmas!! 
PHOEBE: You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best! 
CHANDLER: It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.' 
RACHEL: Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you! 
CHANDLER: Sure, everybody loves a kidder. 
RACHEL: I got the job! 
ALL: That's great! Hey! Excellent! 
PHOEBE: Oh, God bless us, everyone. 
RACHEL: Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy. 
CHANDLER: Should I tell her I ordered tea? 
ROSS: No. 
RACHEL: Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again. 
RACHEL'S BOSS: Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once. 
ROSS: I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!! 
SARAH: Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this. 
ROSS: Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown! 
JOEY: Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off! 
CHANDLER: I'm an alien. I'm an alien. 
ROSS: Oh no! An asteroid! 
JOEY: Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it? 
MONICA: Um-mm. 
JOEY: All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts. 
ROSS: Real magic does exist. 
RACHEL: Wow. 
MONICA: Wow. Joey, how do you do it? 
JOEY: I can't tell you that, no. 
ROSS: Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling. 
RACHEL: Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor. 
MONICA: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything. 
PHOEBE: Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?' 
MONICA: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down. 
MONICA: All right, be my guest. 
RACHEL: Good luck. 
JOEY: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. 
ALL: Oh, I got it. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... . 
GUY: Whoa, you are very beautiful. 
PHOEBE: Oh, thank you. 
CHANDLER: Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end? 
MONICA: Honey, what's the matter? 
CHANDLER: I just saw Janice. 
ALL: Oh. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them. 
JOEY: Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me. 
CHANDLER: Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon. 
JOEY: Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know.... 
ROSS: Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then. 
CHANDLER: Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me. 
MONICA: It's Joey's birthday. 
CHANDLER: Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him. 
MONICA: Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there. 
CHANDLER: Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh. 
MR. KAPLAN: How's that coffee comin,' dear? 
RACHEL: Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan. 
MR. KAPLAN: I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy. 
RACHEL: I know! 
MR. KAPLAN: I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh? 
RACHEL: Op. 
MR. KAPLAN: Eh. 
RACHEL: Oh, you got me. 
MR. KAPLAN: Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound? 
RACHEL: Oh, that sounds great. 
MR. KAPLAN: Come on over here, sweetheart. 
RACHEL: Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much. 
MR. KAPLAN: I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome. 
RACHEL: Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it. 
MONICA: I know honey, I'm sorry. 
RACHEL: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in. 
MONICA: Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy! 
RACHEL: Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom. 
RACHEL: Hi! Is my misery amusing to you? 
GUY: I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... 
RACHEL: It's not funny, this is actually my job. 
GUY: Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus. 
RACHEL: Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger. 
GUY: Ah, just one other thing. 
RACHEL: Yes?! 
GUY: I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested? 
RACHEL: Do you want my pickle? 
GUNTHER: Hey guys. 
MONICA: Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs? 
PHOEBE: Well, he's very charming. 
MONICA: I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him. 
PHOEBE: Well, you're just gonna have to try. 
MONICA: Joey, where are the Jello shots? 
JOEY: I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around... 
JOEY: Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Hello-dillillio!! 
ROSS: Oh, somebody's feeling better. 
MONICA: Stick out your tongue. 
CHANDLER: Take off your shirt! 
MONICA: Oh my!! 
JOEY: Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, Jello just like Mom used to make. 
RACHEL: The most unbelievable thing happened to me today. 
ROSS: Hi! 
RACHEL: Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview! 
ROSS: Wow! 
RACHEL: I know! 
ROSS: What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason? 
RACHEL: Uh-huh! 
ROSS: And he's, he's a total stranger? 
RACHEL: Yeah! His name is um, Mark something. 
ROSS: Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex. 
RACHEL: What!? 
ROSS: Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason. 
RACHEL: To be nice. 
ROSS: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason? 
JOEY: No, only for sex. 
ROSS: Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me? 
RACHEL: I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell. 
ROSS: Uh-huh. 
JOEY'S SISTERS: Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! 
JOEY: Hey!! Hey-hey-hey! 
CHANDLER: Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing? 
MONICA: How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters. 
CHANDLER: Hi Joey's sisters! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
COOKIE: Hey. What are we drinkin' over here. 
PHOEBE: Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice. 
COOKIE: No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband. 
PHOEBE: Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you. 
SISTER 1: What 'cha doing? 
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer. 
JOEY'S SISTERS: Oh!! 
CHANDLER: No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have. 
ROSS: Hi. 
MONICA: Hi. 
ROSS: Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today. 
MONICA: Isn't that great? 
ROSS: Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy. 
MONICA: Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.' 
ROSS: That's excellent. 
ROSS: So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him? 
RACHEL: Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job. 
MONICA: How ya feelin'? 
CHANDLER: Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it. 
PHOEBE: Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. 
ALL: Woooo hoooo!!! 
CHANDLER: Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.' 
PHOEBE: Why, what happened? 
CHANDLER: Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part. 
MONICA: What is the worse part? 
CHANDLER: I can't remember which sister. 
ROSS: You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!! 
MONICA: Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead. 
CHANDLER: Okay! You don't think I thought of that? 
PHOEBE: How can you not know which one? 
RACHEL: I mean that's unbelievable. 
MONICA: I mean, was it Gina? 
ROSS: Which one is Gina? 
RACHEL: Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. 
MONICA: No, no, no, that's Dina. 
CHANDLER: You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!! 
PHOEBE: We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha! 
CHANDLER: Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat. 
MONICA: That was me. 
CHANDLER: Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry. 
MONICA: That's okay. 
RACHEL: That's all right. 
ROSS: That's okay. 
JOEY: Can I talk to you for a second?! 
ROSS: Hey, Joey. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
JOEY: Come on!! 
CHANDLER: Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses. 
JOEY: I just got off the phone with my sister. 
ROSS: Ah, which, which one? 
JOEY: Mary-Angela. 
ROSS: Mary-Angela. 
JOEY: Yeah. 
MONICA: Y'know which one was she again? 
JOEY: Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister. 
CHANDLER: It's gotta be the first one. 
JOEY: Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree. 
CHANDLER: Yep, I'm in a tree. 
RACHEL: Did he call? Did Mark call? 
MONICA: No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet. 
RACHEL: Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe? 
MONICA: I guess they're back from their date. 
RACHEL: Music. Very nice. 
MONICA: Oh my God! 
RACHEL: So, how are you? 
MONICA: I am good. I finished my book. 
RACHEL: Oh yeah, what's it about? 
MONICA: I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk? 
RACHEL: Yeah, I do. 
ROSS: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? 
CHANDLER: Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba. 
ROSS: All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. 
CHANDLER: What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? 
ROSS: Where in Cuba? 
CHANDLER: Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here? 
JOEY: Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? 
CHANDLER: I'm here to see Mary-Angela. 
JOEY: You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah. 
CHANDLER: Where's Mary-Angela? 
JOEY: She's right in there. 
JOEY'S SISTERS: Hey, Chandler! 
RACHEL: I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call. 
ROSS: Bummer. 
RACHEL: Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy. 
ROSS: No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you. 
MONICA: Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen. 
ROSS: But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy. 
MONICA: Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number. 
ROSS: What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home? 
RACHEL: Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me. 
ROSS: That's right good things, that-that is what I said. 
RACHEL: Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. 
ROSS: That is so made up! 
RACHEL: Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview! 
MONICA: Yay! 
ROSS: There you go. 
RACHEL: He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it. 
MONICA: Oh, that is amazing! 
ROSS: Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less. 
RACHEL: I got to figure out what I'm going to wear. 
ROSS: High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro. 
RACHEL: Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo! 
ROSS: You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way? 
MONICA: What? 
ROSS: 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend! 
MONICA: Are you crazy?! 
ROSS: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal. 
MONICA: What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too? 
ROSS: No. 
MONICA: I mean don't you trust her? 
ROSS: Well, yeah! 
MONICA: Then get over yourself! Grow up! 
ROSS: You grow up. 
CHANDLER: This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela? 
JOEY'S GRANDMOTHER: No! I did! 
CHANDLER: Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it? 
JOEY'S GRANDMOTHER: Of course! It's her favorite. 
CHANDLER: So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite? 
JOEY'S GRANDMOTHER: More of Grandma's teramisu. 
CHANDLER: Would you just please....give me the recipe 'cause this is great. It's top notch. 
JOEY'S GRANDMOTHER: That dies with me. 
CHANDLER: So will I. 
JOEY'S SISTER: Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom. 
CHANDLER: Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything. 
JOEY'S SISTER: Just do it. 
CHANDLER: Will you excuse me I have to um..... 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY'S SISTER: Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. 
CHANDLER: Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place. 
JOEY'S SISTER: So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips. 
CHANDLER: Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela. 
JOEY'S SISTER: No, I'm Mary-Theresa. 
CHANDLER: This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is? 
MARY-ANGELA: I am! 
CHANDLER: Oh, this is soo bad. 
MARY-ANGELA: Joey!!! 
CHANDLER: No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey! 
JOEY: What's goin' on? 
CHANDLER: You're it! Now run and hide! 
MARY-THERESA: It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela. 
JOEY: What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela? 
CHANDLER: I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar. 
JOEY'S SISTER: I say, punch him Joey. 
ALL: Yeah! Punch him!! 
CHANDLER: Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya? 
JOEY: Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?! 
CHANDLER: Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again. 
COOKIE: So what. I say, punch him. 
ALL: Yeah! Punch him! Punch him! 
JOEY: No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler. 
COOKIE: I'll do it. 
JOEY: No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela. 
CHANDLER: Okay, absolutely! 
JOEY: All right. 
CHANDLER: You've got it. 
JOEY: Cookie, now you can punch him! 
CHANDLER: What?! 
RACHEL: Hey! 
ROSS: Hi! 
RACHEL: What are you doing here? 
ROSS: Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... 
RACHEL: Oh. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi. 
ROSS: How'd did it go? 
RACHEL: Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up. 
ROSS: I'm so proud of you. 
RACHEL: Me too! 
ROSS: Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so... 
RACHEL: I know. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
MARK: Rachel? 
RACHEL: Yeah. Hi Mark! 
MARK: Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job. 
RACHEL: Oh, I did! 
MARK: Yes. 
RACHEL: Oh my God!! 
ROSS: Congradu!! -lations-lations. 
MONICA: So ah, Phoebe, how was your date? 
PHOEBE: Oh well y'know. 
MONICA: Yeah, I do know. 
PHOEBE: Ick, you were eavesdropping. 
RACHEL: Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down. 
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me. 
ROSS: Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it? 
ROSS: Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too? 
JOEY: All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy? 
ROSS: Ah, we'll all go. Come on. 
PHOEBE: Thanks you guys! Thank you. 
CHANDLER: Don't worry. 
PHOEBE: God, I hope they kick his ass! 
RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry. 
MONICA: Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. 
GUY: May I help you? 
RACHEL: Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes? 
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress. 
RACHEL: Tell him. 
ROSS: It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! 
CHANDLER: All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday? 
ROSS: Why? 
CHANDLER: I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist. 
ROSS: Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. 
CHANDLER: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
ROSS: Hmm? Oh, yeah. 
PHOEBE: Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! 
CHANDLER: It must take you forever to find your keys. 
RACHEL: Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. 
PHOEBE: Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. 
RACHEL: No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. 
ROSS: Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch? 
RACHEL: Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. 
ROSS: Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job? 
RACHEL: Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox? 
PHOEBE: Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. 
RACHEL: Oh. 
CHANDLER: Hey, so can you make it on Friday? 
ROSS: What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? 
CHANDLER: Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper. 
PHOEBE: A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich'. Why don't you get a magician?! 
CHANDLER: Well, if the magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right. 
ROSS: She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do? 
CHANDLER: Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud. 
JOEY: Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? 
CHANDLER: I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. 
JOEY: It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco. 
ROSS: Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities. 
JOEY: What? 
ROSS: Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em. 
JOEY: Who? 
CHANDLER: I'll get you the Cliff Notes. 
JOEY: The what? 
CHANDLER: The abridgment. 
JOEY: Oh, okay. The what? 
MARK: ...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far? 
RACHEL: Yeah. What kind of discount do we get? 
MARK: Twenty percent. 
RACHEL: Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call. 
MARK: Here, let me. Rachel Green's line, how may I help you? 
ROSS: Hi, is Rachel there? 
MARK: And who may I say is calling? 
ROSS: This is Ross? 
MARK: Ross of..... 
ROSS: Of Ross and Rachel. 
MARK: Oh hi. It's, it's Mark. 
ROSS: Oh hey, hey Mark. 
MARK: Hey, hold on a second. 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACHEL: Hi honey! 
ROSS: Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone? 
RACHEL: Oh, he's just goofing around. 
ROSS: Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office? 
RACHEL: Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants. 
ROSS: Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she? 
RACHEL: Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you! 
ROSS: Okay, bye-bye. 
RACHEL: Ow! Ross!! 
ROSS: Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. 
JEANNINE: All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it. 
MONICA: Please, I'm not going for anything. 
JEANNINE: Well, if you don't, I will. 
MONICA: Would you please go? 
JEANNINE: Night Mon. Night Julio. 
JULIO: Adios. 
MONICA: Look Julio, someone left their book here. 
JULIO: Ah actually, that is mine. 
MONICA: Oh yeah, what are you reading? 
JULIO: Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it? 
MONICA: Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it? 
JULIO: I thought I would, but the translation's no good. 
MONICA: Your a poet and don't know it. 
JULIO: Actually I ah, I am a poet. 
MONICA: Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about? 
JULIO: Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip. 
MONICA: Mine? Right here? 
JULIO: I can write an epic poem about this lip. 
MONICA: How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. 
JOEY: You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... 
DIRECTOR: Lovely, just lovely. 
JOEY: Really? Thanks. 
DIRECTOR: Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday. 
JOEY: Excellent, I'll be there. 
DIRECTOR: Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition. 
JOEY: Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. 
DIRECTOR: Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake. 
CHANDLER: ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?! 
JOEY: Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either. 
PHOEBE: Well, can you dance at all? 
JOEY: Yeah, I can dance, y'know. 
CHANDLER: Oh no, no, no, no. 
PHOEBE: What, what is that? 
JOEY: Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. 
CHANDLER: All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? 
MONICA: Hi! 
PHOEBE: Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? 
MONICA: It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem. 
JOEY: Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
CHANDLER: Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. 
JOEY: Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? 
MONICA: Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. 
JOEY: The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
CHANDLER: To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. 
MONICA: Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah. 
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. 
JOEY: Whoa, I'm not done. 
MONICA: All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. 
CHANDLER: Bye-bye. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! 
CHANDLER: What, what, what?! 
PHOEBE: What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! 
CHANDLER: You really think that is what he meant? 
MONICA: Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. 
JOEY: Done. 
MARK: Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file? 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... 
MARK: Wh-what's that? 
ROSS: It's from Ross, it's a love bug. 
MARK: Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend. 
RACHEL: Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic. 
MAN: Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green? 
RACHEL: Yes. 
MAN: One, two, three... 
QUARTET: Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss. 
THE BASS BARBER: Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.

THE BASS BARBER: It's nice to have a boyfriend. 
QUARTET: Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross! 
ROSS: I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt! 
RACHEL: All right Ross!! I get it!! 
ROSS: I mean my God... 
RACHEL: You're hurt! 
ROSS: ...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!! 
RACHEL: Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! 
ROSS: I would never do that! 
RACHEL: Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do. 
ROSS: Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot. 
JOEY: Mark's a genius! 
ROSS: Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
CHANDLER: Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. 
ROSS: What am I going to do? 
CHANDLER: Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. 
ROSS: I don't know you guys. 
CHANDLER: All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' 
JOEY: And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Harddd,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' 
CHANDLER: He paints quite a picture doesn't he? 
WOMAN: Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December. 
MARK: And wait, I've got something for you. 
WOMAN: Mark!! 
MARK: It's okay, Rachel knows. 
WOMAN: Yeah, but even soo. 
MARK: I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you. 
RACHEL: Ohhh! That is soo sweet! 
MARK: Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me. 
ROSS: All right that's, that's it!! Get off her! 
MARK: What is going on? 
ROSS: What's going on?! That's what's going on!! 
RACHEL: Ross! 
ROSS: I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach. 
DIRECTOR: Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island. 
JOEY: So, does that mean the audition is off? 
DIRECTOR: Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination. 
JOEY: What?! 
DIRECTOR: Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, out a beret, out a beret, big turn here, grand dechant, desont, desont, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! 
JOEY: It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. 
DIRECTOR: Have fun. 
JOEY: Bye. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey. 
PHOEBE: What are you wrapping? 
MONICA: Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, it's a vase. 
MONICA: Yeah, just like the one in the poem. 
PHOEBE: Well not exactly like the one in the poem. 
MONICA: What do you mean? 
PHOEBE: Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. 
MONICA: So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? 
JULIO: What? 
MONICA: Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me. 
JULIO: Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
MONICA: You don't even know me... 
JULIO: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you. 
MONICA: What? 
JULIO: The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this. 
MONICA: I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... 
JULIO: No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now? 
MONICA: Oh yeah. 
DIRECTOR: All right, let's do it! 
DIRECTOR: No, no, no. What was that? 
JOEY: I know, it was the best I could get out of them. 
DIRECTOR: Well, people! 
JOEY: People, people, people. 
DIRECTOR: Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off. 
RACHEL: So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? 
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right? 
RACHEL: Right. 
CHANDLER: And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hello. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. 
ROSS: I'm sorry, I was an idiot. 
RACHEL: A big idiot. 
ROSS: A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me. 
RACHEL: Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now? 
ROSS: Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away. 
GUNTHER: Let it be me! Let it be me! 
RACHEL: Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. 
ROSS: I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
CHANDLER: Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn? 
RACHEL: Where ya going? 
ROSS: Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon. 
RACHEL: Ohh, with who? 
ROSS: Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party. 
RACHEL: There was a woman at the... The stripper?! 
ROSS: Yeah. 
RACHEL: You have a play date with a stripper?! 
CHANDLER: Man, I gotta get a kid. 
ROSS: Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay? 
RACHEL: Sure, is she married? 
ROSS: Ahh, no. 
RACHEL: Oh. 
ROSS: Are you jealous? 
RACHEL: Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? 
ROSS: You are totally jealous. 
RACHEL: I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... 
ROSS: Honey, I love you too. 
RACHEL: Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. 
ROSS: What? 
ROSS: Huh. 
RACHEL: Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. 
CHANDLER: Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper. 
MAN: Is there a Julio here? 
JULIO: I am Julio. 
MAN: Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. 
QUARTET: Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch. 
BASS SINGER: No one likes a buttmunch. 
QUARTET: And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!. 
MONICA: Hi. 
CLERK: Six dollars, please. 
MONICA: Six? I just had it for one night. It's three. 
CLERK: Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02. 
MONICA: Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three. 
RICHARD: I can help with that. 
MONICA: Oh my God. Richard? Hi! 
RICHARD: Hi! 
MONICA: Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks. 
RICHARD: So, you look great. 
MONICA: Right. 
RICHARD: No you do. You... just... 
MONICA: What? 
RICHARD: You've got panties stuck to your leg. 
MONICA: That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity. 
RICHARD: It's good to see you. 
MONICA: It's good to see you too. 
MONICA: You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn. 
RICHARD: He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice. 
MONICA: Yeah. 
RICHARD: I missed this. 
MONICA: Me too. 
RICHARD: So, you wanna get a hamburger or something? 
MONICA: Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea. 
RICHARD: Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise. 
MONICA: No, I just I think that it's too soon. 
RICHARD: No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, baby! 
ROSS: What are you doing? 
CHANDLER: Making chocolate milk. Do you want some? 
ROSS: No thanks. I'm 29. 
RACHEL: Oh my God, I gotta go to work! 
ROSS: Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight? 
RACHEL: Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late. 
ROSS: Oh come on, not again. 
RACHEL: I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay? 
ROSS: Hmm. 
RACHEL: For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work... 
ROSS: Yeah. 
RACHEL: I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past. 
ROSS: Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that. 
RACHEL: Right. 
PHOEBE: Hi. 
ALL: Hey. 
JOEY: Look at you. Since when do you roller blade? 
PHOEBE: Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff. 
ROSS: And what are you going to do for him? 
PHOEBE: I'm going to let him. 
ROSS: Okay. 
JOEY: Cool. 
MONICA: Morning. 
ALL: Hey. 
RACHEL: Somebody got in late last night. 
MONICA: Yeah well, I ran into Richard. 
RACHEL: When did this happen? 
MONICA: Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger. 
PHOEBE: Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger. 
ROSS: So, are you gonna see him again? 
MONICA: Tomorrow night. 
RACHEL: Monica, what are you doing? 
CHANDLER: Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him. 
MONICA: It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has. 
JOEY: Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex. 
MONICA: We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends. 
ROSS: Naked friends. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
JOEY: Hey. 
RACHEL: Do you have any ice? 
JOEY: Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late. 
RACHEL: Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day? 
JOEY: I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue. 
RACHEL: Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? 
JOEY: Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so. 
RACHEL: But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer? 
JOEY: Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know. 
RACHEL: How often do you read it? 
JOEY: Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again? 
RACHEL: Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining? 
JOEY: The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours. 
RACHEL: Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women. 
JOEY: All right, you got it. 
RACHEL: All right. 
JOEY: Okay. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
JOEY: Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women. 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
JOEY: How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little? 
PHOEBE: Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. 
CHANDLER: Oh, hey. 
ROBERT: Hi. 
ROSS: Hey. 
PHOEBE: You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed. 
ROSS: Oh. 
CHANDLER: So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts? 
ROBERT: Well, I'm from California. 
CHANDLER: Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames. 
CHANDLER: I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything? 
PHOEBE: I'll have coffee. 
ROBERT: Yeah, me too. 
ROSS: Yeah, make that three. 
CHANDLER: Okay Ross, why don't you come with me? 
ROSS: Okay. What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on? 
CHANDLER: Robert's coming out. 
ROSS: What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay? 
CHANDLER: No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts. 
ROSS: What?! 
CHANDLER: The man is showing brain. 
ROSS: Are you sure? Hold on. I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a.... 
ROBERT: Coffee. 
ROSS: Okay. 
ROBERT: We could write it down for you? 
ROSS: No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary 
CHANDLER: Wellll? 
ROSS: Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
CHANDLER: What do we do? What do we do? 
ROSS: Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it. 
CHANDLER: Like an eclipse. 
RICHARD: So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say? 
MONICA: You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes. 
RICHARD: Ew, this feels very weird. 
MONICA: You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird. 
RICHARD: Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand. 
MONICA: Oops. 
RICHARD: Okay. 
MONICA: Gotta keep squishing. 
RICHARD: Tomatoes are squishing. 
MONICA: Okay. 
RICHARD: Op. 
MONICA: Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. 
RICHARD: Yeah. 
MONICA: Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be..... 
RICHARD: What? 
MONICA: Umm, you've got some on your pants. 
RICHARD: I'll just throw them out. 
JOEY: These little women. Wow! 
CHANDLER: Your liking it, huh? 
JOEY: Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her. 
ROSS: Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine. 
JOEY: But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining. 
CHANDLER: No, actually Laurie's a boy. 
JOEY: No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
ROSS: Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go? 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer. 
CHANDLER: You mean a three pointer? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I get more because I'm dainty. 
ROBERT: So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter? 
ROBERT: Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock. 
JOEY: What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met. 
ROBERT: Ah, good to meet you. Robert. 
PHOEBE: What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?! 
ROSS: Calm down. There's no reason to get testy. 
PHOEBE: You guys!! Come on! 
CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped. 
PHOEBE: What do you mean? 
ROBERT: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
JOEY: Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies? 
ROBERT: Sure. 
MONICA: So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word! 
MONICA: Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure. 
RICHARD: You really sure? 
MONICA: I'll call you back. 
MONICA: So we can be friends who sleep together. 
RICHARD: Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball. 
MONICA: Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies? 
RICHARD: Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday. 
MONICA: Oh. 
RICHARD: You want me to cancel it? 
MONICA: No! No! 
RICHARD: Okay. 
MONICA: 'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends. 
RICHARD: Exactly. 
ROBERT: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down! 
ROBERT: You ready to go to the batting cage? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. And, first here's a gift. 
ROBERT: Oh! Wow! Hey! 
CHANDLER: Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day! 
ROBERT: Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry. 
PHOEBE: That's all right, that's well, I figured.... 
ROBERT: Hey! 
JOEY: Hey! How's it going? 
ROSS: Good. 
JOEY: Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining? 
RACHEL: Oh, Danny just went into room 217. 
JOEY: Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub... 
RACHEL: Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it! 
JOEY: All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway? 
CHANDLER: Hmmm, that's very cool. 
JOEY: Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww! 
RACHEL: Joey! I can't believe you just did that! 
CHANDLER: I can't believe she cracked your code! 
RACHEL: All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy. 
JOEY: Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad. 
RACHEL: Eh. Beth dies. 
JOEY: Beth, Beth dies? 
RACHEL: Um-hmm. 
JOEY: Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die? 
CHANDLER: No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel? 
RACHEL: What?! 
ROSS: Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson? 
RACHEL: No. She doesn't die. 
JOEY: Then why would you say that?! 
RACHEL: Because, I wanted to hurt you. 
ROBERT: Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys. 
RACHEL: Oh my.... 
ROBERT: Got 'em. 
MONICA: Hi. 
RACHEL: Sorry. I'm sorry. 
MONICA: You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire. 
MONICA: What are you smiling at? 
RACHEL: I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up. 
MONICA: Yeah, right. 
RICHARD: Hello. 
MONICA: I love this friend thing! 
PHOEBE: Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him? 
ROSS: Oh. 
PHOEBE: Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?' 
CHANDLER: We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. 
ROSS: He's right, even if it's to say something complementary. 
ROBERT: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
ROBERT: So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other. 
PHOEBE: No, I can spot you from here. 
ROBERT: What? 
PHOEBE: Okay, listen Robert... 
ROSS: Hey, don't we have to... 
CHANDLER: Yeah, we got, um-hmm. 
PHOEBE: Umm, I think you're really, really great... 
ROBERT: Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts? 
PHOEBE: I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say. 
GUNTHER: Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house. 
MONICA: Ow! 
RICHARD: Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings. 
RICHARD'S DATE: Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour. 
MONICA: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
RICHARD: Ah well, this is the living room. 
RICHARD'S DATE: Impressive. 
RICHARD: All right. This is the kitchen. 
RICHARD'S DATE: Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom? 
RICHARD: The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom. 
RICHARD'S DATE: We're still on this side of the door. 
RICHARD: Um-hmm. 
RICHARD'S DATE: Yeah, but I didn't get to see it. 
RICHARD: Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening. 
MONICA: So um, who was she? 
RICHARD: Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today. 
MONICA: Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this. 
RICHARD: Well, you seem fine. 
MONICA: Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people? 
RICHARD: You mean like exclusive friends? 
MONICA: Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever. 
RICHARD: Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed. 
MONICA: That's not true, you don't have a moustache. 
RICHARD: Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end. 
MONICA: Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again. 
RICHARD: I know I couldn't. So.... 
MONICA: How 'bout one last game of racquetball? 
MONICA: Watch the thorns! 
RICHARD: Ow!! 
RACHEL: What? 
JOEY: Beth is really, really sick. 
RACHEL: Awwww. 
JOEY: Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do. 
RACHEL: Joey? 
JOEY: Yeah. 
RACHEL: Do you want to put the book in the freezer? 
JOEY: Okay. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
SINGER: 'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know..... 
JOEY: Wow! This girl is good. 
PHOEBE: Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. 
CHANDLER: I like her. 
PHOEBE: Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? 
CHANDLER: Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people. 
MONICA: Look at you. All jealous. 
ROSS: Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more 
SINGER: beside meeeee-eeee-ee. . 
PHOEBE: Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done. 
SINGER: Okay, my next song's called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way. 
PHOEBE: Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs. 
SINGER: Hey Phoebe. 
PHOEBE: Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here? 
LESLIE: I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm.... 
CHANDLER: All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish. 
JOEY: So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles. 
PHOEBE: Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles. 
JOEY: Ah, anything we might of heard of? 
LESLIE: Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away.. 
MONICA, ROSS, AND JOEY: Home is Home Star stew. 
LESLIE: Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me. 
PHOEBE: Hmm, bummer. 
LESLIE: Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together? 
PHOEBE: No. But thanks. 
LESLIE: Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it? 
PHOEBE: Okay. No. But thanks. 
LESLIE: Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. 
JOEY: Wow, that was kinda brutal. 
PHOEBE: Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please? 
MONICA: Yeah, sure. 
GUNTHER: Someone in there? 
CHANDLER: No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.' 
CHANDLER: Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high? 
WOMAN: Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name. 
WOMAN: Ginger. 
CHANDLER: Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so.... 
GINGER: Don't you have to use the bathroom? 
CHANDLER: Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. 
GUNTHER: Someone in here. 
PHOEBE: Where's Chandler? 
JOEY: Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh! 
GINGER: Joey? Joey Tribbiani? 
GINGER: Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats. 
JOEY: Phew, close one. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi, sweetie! 
ROSS: Hello. 
MARK: Hi, Ross. 
ROSS: Yeah, huh. 
RACHEL: I've got some bad news. 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. 
ROSS: Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time? 
MARK: Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today. 
ROSS: But work comes first! Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya? 
RACHEL: Nooo, he's leaving for a better job. 
ROSS: Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? Good bye. 
MARK: Okay, then. 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACHEL: Well we're gonna miss you around here. 
MARK: Yeah, me too. 
MARK: So, see ya on Saturday. 
RACHEL: Yeah, you bet. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
MONICA: Y'know those are a delicacy in India. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie! 
MONICA: Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh? 
PHOEBE: Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together. 
MONICA: Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge. 
PHOEBE: You never run on a barge! 
JOEY: Hey. 
PHOEBE AND MONICA: Hey. 
JOEY: Is ah, is Chandler around? 
MONICA: No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house. 
JOEY: Oooh. 
MONICA: Yeah, Ginger something. 
JOEY: Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer? 
MONICA: No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.' 
JOEY: Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did. 
MONICA: Well, what did you do? 
JOEY: What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life. 
MONICA: Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way. 
JOEY: All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner.... 
MONICA: You gave her food poisoning!? 
JOEY: I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire! 
JOEY: I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg. 
MONICA: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire? 
JOEY: I ran!! 
CHANDLER: Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room. 
GINGER: Actually, me too. 
CHANDLER: Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle. 
GINGER: Oh damn, I hate that. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes. 
GINGER: Oh, don't worry about it. 
CHANDLER: No, really you're gonna freeze. 
GINGER: No, I'm not. 
CHANDLER: You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot? 
GINGER: Some day, maybe. 
RACHEL: Funny book? 
ROSS: Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.' 
RACHEL: Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind. 
ROSS: Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm.... 
RACHEL: Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark. 
ROSS: Oh, well... 
RACHEL: Oh my God!!! Ross!! 
ROSS: Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him? 
RACHEL: Because, he's my friend. 
ROSS: Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean... 
RACHEL: Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? 
ROSS: Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing? 
RACHEL: I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. 
ROSS: Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you. 
RACHEL: Really!? 
ROSS: Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger. 
RACHEL: Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What? 
ROSS: What should I wear, now I'm all nervous. 
MONICA: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps. 
PHOEBE: It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know. 
MONICA: Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to. 
PHOEBE: You think you know me so well. 
MONICA: Well, don't 'cha wanna? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 
MONICA: Okay, well I do know you. 
PHOEBE: That's what I said. 
MONICA: Well so? 
PHOEBE: I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives. 
LESLIE: My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I.... 
PHOEBE: I stepped in something icky. 
PHOEBE AND LESLIE: Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee. 
LECTURER: We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink.... 
ROSS: I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you. 
RACHEL: Oh. 
PHOEBE: Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault. 
LESLIE: Wow, that's great. 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah! 
LESLIE: Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. 
PHOEBE: I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. 
LESLIE: What? Why not? You could make a ton of money. 
PHOEBE: Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. 
LESLIE: Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry. 
PHOEBE: That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up. 
LECTURER: ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now. 
MONICA: Hi! 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
MONICA: Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad. 
CHANDLER: Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car. 
MONICA: So umm, how was your date with Ginger? 
CHANDLER: Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness. 
MONICA: Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package. 
CHANDLER: Joey told you about the leg, huh? 
MONICA: Uh-huh. 
CHANDLER: Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world. 
JOEY: Morning. 
CHANDLER: Actually he's the smallest person in the world. 
JOEY: Heard about the leg burnin' huh? 
CHANDLER: It came up. 
JOEY: Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny? 
ROSS: So I nodded off a little. 
RACHEL: Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks! 
ROSS: Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses. 
RACHEL: Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!' 
ROSS: First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly. 
RACHEL: Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah. 
ROSS: Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka. 
RACHEL: Oh, that is so... 
ROSS: No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. 
RACHEL: Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark? 
ROSS: No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it. 
RACHEL: It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life. 
ROSS: That's a little clearer. 
RACHEL: Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay? 
ROSS: Sure, I-I-I... 
GINGER: Your thinking about my leg aren't you? 
CHANDLER: No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again? 
GINGER: It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: 'How much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? 
CHANDLER: No. No. I don't think so. 
GINGER: Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it. 
GINGER: What's that? 
CHANDLER: That's-that's my nubbin. 
GINGER: What's a nubbin? 
CHANDLER: It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing. 
GINGER: You have three nipples? 
CHANDLER: Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what? 
GINGER: Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave. 
CHANDLER: You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come? 
GINGER: Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay. 
PHOEBE: Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you? 
LESLIE: Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay. 
PHOEBE: Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay 
LESLIE: I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts. 
PHOEBE: No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it. 
LESLIE: No, no, I don't want to forget it. 
PHOEBE: Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be? 
COMMERCIAL: Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter. 
MONICA: Sorry, Pheebs. 
JOEY: Yeah. You okay? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song? 
JOEY: Yeah. 
MONICA: We'd love too. 
PHOEBE: Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far. 
CHANDLER: Well hello! 
JOEY: Where have you been? 
CHANDLER: The doctor. 
ROSS: Is everything okay? 
CHANDLER: Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting. 
MONICA: Wow! It's like Rachel in High School. 
RACHEL: What?!! 
MONICA: Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke! 
CHANDLER: That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done! 
JOEY: Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives? 
MONICA: I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95. 
JOEY: Done. 
PHOEBE: Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas! 
MONICA: Why? Do you have a report due? 
PHOEBE: I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is. 
MONICA: Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN. 
PHOEBE: Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace. 
MONICA: Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from? 
PHOEBE: Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there. 
MONICA: Where's that? 
PHOEBE: In your atlas! 
MONICA: I don't have an atlas. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
MONICA: Oh, but wait I do have a globe. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
MONICA: Hold on. 
JOEY: So Pheebs what's this guy like? 
PHOEBE: Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me. 
MONICA: 'Kay, here you go. 
PHOEBE: What is this? 
MONICA: It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener. 
CHANDLER: Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place. 
MONICA: Oh, no thanks. 
CHANDLER: Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of. 
MONICA: Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there? 
JOEY: Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again? 
CHANDLER: Yeah! You wanna come? 
JOEY: Yeah! 
CHANDLER: Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!! 
ISSAC: Can I help you? 
CHANDLER: Uh-oh. 
JOEY: Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it. 
ISSAC: Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you. 
CHANDLER: Okay, that hurt us. 
CHLOE: Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning. 
CHANDLER: Well ah, ........y'know. 
CHLOE: Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night? 
JOEY: Both of us? 
CHLOE: Maybe. Does that scare ya? 
CHLOE: Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come. 
JOEY: We'll be there. 
CHLOE: Great. I'll ah, see ya then. 
CHANDLER: All right, rock on. 
SERGEI: 
MISCHA: He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.' 
PHOEBE: Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here. 
MISCHA: Your eyes are very pretty. 
PHOEBE: Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you! 
MISCHA: He would like to kiss you. 
PHOEBE: Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
MISCHA: Oy! 
PHOEBE: See there it is right there. 
MONICA: Wow! It's small. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it. 
MONICA: So you had fun, huh? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way. 
MONICA: No. 
ROSS: Hey. 
PHOEBE AND MONICA: Hey. 
ROSS: What is ah, Rach in her room? 
MONICA: Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her. 
ROSS: Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary? 
MONICA: All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel. 
ROSS: What's that on the bottom? 
MONICA: Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy. 
RACHEL: Hello. 
ROSS: Hey, honey. 
RACHEL: Oh, hi. 
ROSS: Hey, what's going on? 
RACHEL: Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night. 
ROSS: What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there? 
RACHEL: No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with. 
PHOEBE: Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute. 
MONICA: Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry? 
PHOEBE: Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry! 
CHANDLER: Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there? 
JOEY: Uh, 10:30. 
CHANDLER: What time is it now? 
JOEY: 4:30. 
CHANDLER: Yeah all right, so we'll hang out. 
JOEY: Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us? 
CHANDLER: Yes. Vividly. 
JOEY: She was kidding about that right? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so... 
JOEY: God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh? 
CHANDLER: Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do? 
JOEY: Dude, I don't know. 
CHANDLER: She was kidding. 
JOEY: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules. 
JOEY: Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing. 
CHANDLER: Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... 
JOEY: Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be? 
CHANDLER: Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it. 
JOEY: Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails. 
CHANDLER: Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you. 
RACHEL: No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding. 
ROSS: Hi! 
RACHEL: Oh!! My God, what are you doing here? 
ROSS: Well you said you couldn't go out so.... 
SOPHIE: You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up. 
RACHEL: Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis. 
ROSS: Yeah, but I got cous-cous! 
RACHEL: Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop. 
ROSS: Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here. 
RACHEL: But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone! 
SOPHIE: I love Mark. Do you know Mark? 
ROSS: Yeah!! 
RACHEL: Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I... 
ROSS: Pepper? 
RACHEL: None for me. 
ROSS: Okay sorry, whew. 
RACHEL: I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!! 
ROSS: Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 
RACHEL: Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing? 
ROSS: I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again. 
RACHEL: Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop. 
ROSS: Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes? 
RACHEL: I don't have ten minutes!! 
ROSS: What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes? 
RACHEL: Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't! 
ROSS: Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week. 
RACHEL: Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later. 
ROSS: Yeah, but wait... 
RACHEL: Good bye! 
SOPHIE: Actually, that's our three hole punch. 
ROSS: Hey. 
RACHEL: Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... 
ROSS: No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed. 
RACHEL: I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. 
ROSS: For what? For letting you throw me out of your office? 
RACHEL: You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger! 
ROSS: Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I. 
RACHEL: But I told you, I didn't have the time! 
ROSS: Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel. 
RACHEL: Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit me job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? 
ROSS: No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job! 
RACHEL: Just a job! 
ROSS: Yes. 
RACHEL: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that... 
ROSS: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore. 
RACHEL: Well neither do I! 
ROSS: Is this about Mark? 
RACHEL: Oh my God. 
ROSS: Okay, it's not, it's not. 
RACHEL: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard. 
ROSS: Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do. 
RACHEL: I don't know, I don't know. Look, maybe we should take a break. 
ROSS: Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.. 
RACHEL: No. A break from us. 
CHLOE: And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71. 
CHLOE: Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross. 
ROSS: Oh, hi Chloe. 
CHLOE: I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!' 
CHANDLER: And that's the only colour that comes in. 
ISSAC: Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine? 
CHLOE: Oh! 
CHANDLER: So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner. 
ROSS: Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead. 
MONICA: Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez vous couchet avec moi, saiz soi. Why? What did I say? 
MISCHA: Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight. 
MONICA: Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice. 
PHOEBE: Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. 
PHOEBE: You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali. 
MISCHA: Boutros Boutros Gali. 
MISCHA: He says he was too. 
PHOEBE: Interesting. 
MISCHA: So I was wondering.... 
PHOEBE: Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. 
MISCHA: Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So your a chef? 
MONICA: I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant. 
MISCHA: Oh, really. 
PHOEBE: Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing? 
MONICA: Well, I was having a conversation. 
PHOEBE: Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other. 
MONICA: What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation? 
PHOEBE: That would be great. Thank you. 
RACHEL: Hello! 
MARK: Oh, hi. It's Mark. 
RACHEL: Oh. 
MARK: What? Is it my breath? 
RACHEL: No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi! 
MARK: Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner? 
RACHEL: Yeah. Well, umm..... 
MARK: Rach, are you okay? 
RACHEL: Yeah, I'm fine. 
MARK: You wanna talk, I mean I can come over? 
RACHEL: No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay. 
MARK: All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food. 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry. 
MARK: It's for me. 
RACHEL: Oh. Okay, bye. 
JOEY: So what are you gonna do? 
ROSS: What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up. 
CHANDLER: Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out. 
ROSS: Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while? 
CHANDLER: Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!! 
CHANDLER: Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth. 
JOEY: Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny. 
CHANDLER: Why? What happened to him? 
JOEY: Nothing, he's just really believes in that. 
RACHEL: Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break. 
MARK: Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll? 
RACHEL: No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there. 
MARK: Well, then he's, he's probably just, out. 
RACHEL: Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over. 
RACHEL: Hello. 
ROSS: Hi! It's me. 
RACHEL: Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called. 
ROSS: Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this? 
MARK: Hey, what do you want to drink? 
ROSS: Who's that? 
RACHEL: Nobody. 
MARK: Is it okay if I finish the apple juice? 
ROSS: Is that Mark? 
RACHEL: Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... 
ROSS: Yeah! Got it! 
CHLOE: Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance. 
ROSS: Ah, that's okay, thanks. 
CHLOE: Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance. 
ROSS: Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay? 
CHLOE: Oh, okay. Hey, two beers. 
MISCHA: And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages. 
MONICA: Oh. Can I have a tissue? 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it. 
MISCHA: Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight. 
PHOEBE: Well, tell him, apology accepted. 
MISCHA: Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei? 
PHOEBE: Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner? 
MONICA: Hey, the man's dog just died. 
MISCHA: I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons. 
MONICA: It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons. 
SERGEI: Uh, plate? 
PHOEBE: Plate! Yes, plate. 
SERGEI: Plate. Plate. Plate. 
PHOEBE: See, we don't need them. 
SERGEI: Plate? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 
ROSS: I like this song. 
CHLOE: Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here? 
ROSS: Oh, no, no. 
CHLOE: What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay. 
RACHEL: Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home. 
CHLOE: Still no smile? 
SERGEI: Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan. 
PHOEBE: Ameri-can. 
SERGEI: Ameri-ccan. 
PHOEBE: Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again. 
SERGEI: Everybody!! 
 JOEY: Previously on Friends. 
ROSS: I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore. 
RACHEL: You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend? 
ROSS: Is this about Mark? 
RACHEL: Oh my God. 
ROSS: Okay, it’s not, it’s not. 
RACHEL: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. 
ROSS: Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. 
RACHEL: No. A break from us. 
RACHEL: Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break. 
ROSS: I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this? 
MARK: Hey, what do you want to drink? 
ROSS: Who’s that? 
RACHEL: Nobody. 
ROSS: Is that Mark? 
RACHEL: Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... 
ROSS: Yeah! Got it! 
CHLOE: Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay. 
MONICA: Hey. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
MONICA: How’s the big anniversary dinner? 
RACHEL: Well, we never actually got to dinner. 
MONICA: Ohhh, nice. 
RACHEL: No, we kinda broke up instead. 
MONICA: What?! 
RACHEL: God, Monica it’s on the ceiling. 
MONICA: That’s okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?! 
RACHEL: Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over. 
MONICA: Oh no!! 
RACHEL: No. 
MONICA: Rachel, you and Mark?! 
RACHEL: No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work. 
CHLOE: Morning! 
RACHEL: Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. 
ROSS: Yeah!! 
RACHEL: Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine. 
ROSS: Na-huh. 
RACHEL: So, I love you. 
ROSS: I love you. 
RACHEL: And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30. 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACHEL: Bye. 
ROSS: Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!! 
CHLOE: Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get? 
ROSS: Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one? 
CHLOE: But my apartment is so... 
ROSS: Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going! 
CHLOE: Wait! Where’s my shoes? 
ROSS: You, you sure you need shoes? Okay. 
CHLOE: Do I know why we’re rushing? 
ROSS: Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! 
CHLOE: That’s so great for you guys! 
ROSS: Yeah! 
CHLOE: You must be so happy! 
ROSS: Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... 
CHLOE: Good luck, with your girlfriend. 
ROSS: Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!! 
RACHEL: Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. 
ROSS: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. 
RACHEL: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? 
ROSS: Yes, you can, very much. 
ROSS: Ahhhh!! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling? 
MONICA: Oh, there’s banana on it. 
PHOEBE: Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine. 
MONICA: So then you know? 
PHOEBE: The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail. 
MONICA: Oh, good. Thanks. 
PHOEBE: Now what is Fabutec? 
MONICA: Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing.... 
PHOEBE: Waxine!! 
MONICA: Yes! Have you seen it? 
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl. 
MONICA: I know!! 
PHOEBE: God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that? 
MONICA: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest! 
PHOEBE: They have the best stuff in there. 
CHANDLER: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
JOEY: Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh? 
ROSS: You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did. 
CHANDLER: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you? 
ROSS: What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other? 
JOEY: Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble. 
CHANDLER: He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her. 
JOEY: Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild. 
ROSS: Yeah, but don’t you think.... 
CHANDLER: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for. 
ROSS: Yeah, okay. 
JOEY: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. Did you think about the trail? 
ROSS: What trail? 
JOEY: The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail! 
ROSS: Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail. 
CHANDLER: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it! 
PHOEBE: After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one, 
MONICA: Did that! 
PHOEBE: Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion. 
MONICA: Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh! 
PHOEBE: Was it not pain-free? 
MONICA: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax. 
PHOEBE: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad. 
MONICA: That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest. 
PHOEBE: Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!! 
MONICA: Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips? 
ROSS: Chloe? Hi.. 
CHLOE: Is this about me taking your watch? 
ROSS: You took my watch? 
CHLOE: I’m sorry, I do that. 
ROSS: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? 
CHLOE: Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know. 
ROSS: Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right? 
CHLOE: Oh, well I tell Issac everything. 
ROSS: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met... 
ISSAC: You dog! 
ROSS: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend. 
ISSAC: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place. 
ROSS: Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her. 
ISSAC: Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule. 
ROSS: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself? 
ISSAC: Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me. 
ROSS: Actually, no, we’re not. 
ISSAC: Yeah, we are. 
ROSS: No, we’re not. 
ISSAC: Yeah, we are. 
ROSS: No, we’re not!! 
ISSAC: Okay, we’re not. 
ROSS: Right. 
ISSAC: But, we are. 
ROSS: Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister. 
ISSAC: I can promise not to tell her again. 
ROSS: Jasmine? 
JASMINE: Uh-huh. 
ROSS: We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller. 
JASMINE: You did a bad thing! 
ROSS: Yes, I did. 
JASMINE: Very bad! 
ROSS: Very bad. 
JASMINE: Very, very bad. 
ROSS: I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet? 
JASMINE: No. 
ROSS: Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay? 
JASMINE: All right. 
ROSS: Thank you, thank you. 
JASMINE: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too. 
ROSS: Who’s your roommate? 
ROSS: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place. 
GUNTHER: I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to? 
MONICA: Ow! 
PHOEBE: Oh!! 
MONICA: Ow!! Ow!! 
PHOEBE: Ow!!! 
MONICA AND PHOEBE: Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow! 
PHOEBE: We’re all right. 
MONICA: It’s okay, it’s okay. 
PHOEBE: We’re all right. 
MONICA: We were just waxing our legs. 
CHANDLER: Off?!! 
PHOEBE: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely. 
JOEY: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax. 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, come here. 
CHANDLER: Oh, that’s mature. 
JOEY: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off? 
PHOEBE: Uh-huh. 
MONICA: That’s right. 
ROSS: Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!! 
RACHEL: I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now! 
MONICA: What? 
CHANDLER: Nothing, nothing. 
MONICA: Rachel said everything was okay. 
PHOEBE: What, what are they talking about? 
ROSS: Rachel? 
RACHEL: Just get away from me! 
ROSS: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay? 
RACHEL: A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?! 
PHOEBE: Whe-where did he put it?! 
RACHEL: Ross, you had sex with another woman! 
MONICA: Oh my God. 
PHOEBE: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk.... 
MONICA: Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?! 
CHANDLER: He has sex, and we get hit in our heads. 
RACHEL: Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! 
ROSS: No!! 
RACHEL: Just get out! Now!! 
ROSS: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this. 
RACHEL: Okay! All right! How was she? 
CHANDLER: Uh-oh. 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: Was she good? 
JOEY: Don’t answer that. 
RACHEL: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she? 
ROSS: She was... 
JOEY: Awful! Horrible! 
CHANDLER: She was not good. Not good. 
JOEY: She was nothing compared to you. 
ROSS: She, she was different. 
JOEY: Ewwwww! 
CHANDLER: Uh-oh. 
RACHEL: Good different? 
ROSS: Nobody likes change. 
ROSS: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
PHOEBE: Should we do something? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel. 
ROSS: I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible. 
RACHEL: Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?! 
ROSS: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me! 
RACHEL: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
ROSS: Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up. 
RACHEL: We were on a break! 
ROSS: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up. 
RACHEL: You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality? 
ROSS: Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead! 
RACHEL: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake! 
JOEY: Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. 
MONICA: What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there. 
JOEY: Why not?! I’m hungry. 
MONICA: Because they’ll know we’ve been listening. 
RACHEL: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!! 
ROSS: Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen! 
RACHEL: Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about. 
JOEY: Yeah, we’ll be fine. 
ROSS: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to. 
CHANDLER: Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever. 
PHOEBE: Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there. 
ROSS: Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark? 
RACHEL: All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me? 
ROSS: Yes I would. 
RACHEL: You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? 
ROSS: Yes. 
RACHEL: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.... 
ROSS: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you. 
ALL: Ohhhhh! 
ROSS: What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking? 
RACHEL: I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza. 
ROSS: Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’ 
JOEY: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza. 
PHOEBE: We could eat the wax! It’s organic. 
CHANDLER: Oh great, food with hair on it. 
PHOEBE: No, not the used wax. 
CHANDLER: Because that would be crazy? 
ROSS: Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself. 
RACHEL: Fine. Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza. 
ROSS: No anchovies. 
RACHEL: With ah, extra anchovies. 
ROSS: That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off. 
RACHEL: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce? 
ROSS: You can have the last piece, if you want. 
RACHEL: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone. 
PHOEBE: They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too. 
MONICA: What if they don’t? 
JOEY: You think I need a new walk? 
CHANDLER: What? 
JOEY: Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk. 
CHANDLER: Are you actually saying these words? 
ROSS: What, now you’re not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey! 
JOEY: Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay. 
MONICA: Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved. 
ROSS: Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough! 
RACHEL: That’s.... 
ROSS: That’s what?! 
RACHEL: That is neither here nor there. 
ROSS: Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much. 
RACHEL: No Ross!! Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay? 
ROSS: Okay, okay, okay. 
RACHEL: I think you should go. 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I really think you need to go now. 
ROSS: Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together... 
RACHEL: Yeah, what the hell did I know! 
ROSS: Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and.... 
RACHEL: No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever. 
ROSS: Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean. 
RACHEL: Then how come it is? 
PHOEBE: They’ve been quiet for a long time. 
JOEY: Maybe she killed him? 
CHANDLER: Let’s go. 
CHANDLER: Is that your new walk? 
JOEY: No, I really have to pee. 
JOEY: Can I see the comics? 
CHANDLER: This is the New York Times. 
JOEY: Okay, may I see the comics? 
MONICA: Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game? 
CHANDLER: We are. He’s meeting us here. 
MONICA: No! Rachel is meeting us here. 
PHOEBE: Oh come on, they can be in the same room. 
JOEY: Yeah, you shoulda been there last night. 
PHOEBE: Why? What happened now? 
JOEY: Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler.... 
CHANDLER: Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something. 
JOEY: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other. 
PHOEBE: Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else. 
JOEY: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now. 
PHOEBE: Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts. 
PHOEBE: Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy.... 
JOEY: I had the same dream! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. 
JOEY: Oh, I had the opposite dream. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week. 
JOEY: Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship. 
MONICA: It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship. 
MONICA: Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!! 
RACHEL: Hey! 
MONICA: Let’s get the show on it! 
RACHEL: Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee. 
MONICA: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close. 
RACHEL: Closer than here? 
PHOEBE: Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let’s scidaddle. 
RACHEL: Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee. 
PHOEBE: Okay, your highness. 
PHOEBE: Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?! 
RACHEL: Is he here? 
CHANDLER: No. 
RACHEL: Oh. Here’s your moisturiser. Hi! 
MONICA AND PHOEBE: Hey! 
RACHEL: You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right? 
CHANDLER: Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross. 
RACHEL: Oh, well okay. Well, there you go. 
PHOEBE: No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out. 
RACHEL: Hm-mm. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine. 
RACHEL: Ohh! 
MONICA: We’re sorry honey. 
RACHEL: Oh, it’s okay. 
JOEY: Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear? 
RACHEL: And heels. 
JOEY: Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside. 
RACHEL: No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. 
PHOEBE: Ohhh boy, do I feel bad. 
JOEY: Oh yeah. 
MONICA: Very bad. 
PHOEBE: Chandler what are you doing?! 
MONICA: Chandler!! 
CHANDLER: Oh my God! 
JOEY: You’re smoking again?! 
CHANDLER: Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still. 
PHOEBE: Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum? 
CHANDLER: Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place. 
MONICA: Weren’t you nine?! 
CHANDLER: Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time.... 
CHANDLER: Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him. 
PHOEBE: Him? Him, Ross? 
CHANDLER: Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. 
RACHEL: Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules. 
ALL: Absolutely, yeah! 
RACHEL: Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?! 
CHANDLER: Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!! 
JOEY: Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here! 
PHOEBE: Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets. 
ROSS: Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks. 
CHANDLER: Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window. 
ROSS: Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it’ll be great! 
JOEY: It’ll be great for next weekend. 
ROSS: No, no, no, this weekend guys! 
JOEY: It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, it’ll be grrreat. 
ROSS: What’s going on? 
PHOEBE: Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. 
ROSS: So, for the whole weekend? 
MONICA: We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first. 
ROSS: Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand. 
PHOEBE: Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around. 
JOEY: Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay. 
MONICA: Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother. 
ROSS: What a pity stay? 
MONICA: No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge! 
ROSS: Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays. 
CHANDLER: Well, then, I might as well offer to stay. 
JOEY: Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross? 
MONICA: Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us? 
CHANDLER: Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles. 
JOEY: What? Mine aren’t tinted. 
PHOEBE: Chandler!! 
CHANDLER: What? 
PHOEBE: What does the sign say? 
CHANDLER: Beam me up Jesus. 
PHOEBE: No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab. 
CHANDLER: Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom. 
ALL: Oh! 
PHOEBE: Please! 
MONICA: No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas. 
CHANDLER: Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo. 
JOEY: Oh, now I have to go!! 
CHANDLER: Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves. 
MONICA: What? 
RACHEL: Okay. 
MONICA: Ow! 
PHOEBE: Aren’t you gonna go? 
RACHEL: No. Thank you. 
MONICA: No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms. 
RACHEL: Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ Well, if everybody’s going. 
PHOEBE: No, y'know what don’t close it ‘cause the... keys.. are in there. 
CHANDLER: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!! 
JOEY: What’s going on? 
CHANDLER: My lighter’s in there! 
CHANDLER: Damn! The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this! 
JOEY: Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger? 
CHANDLER: Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning. 
MONICA: So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person? 
JOEY: Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra! 
MONICA: What?! 
RACHEL: What?! 
JOEY: Come on! Who has the biggest boobs? 
MONICA: Please!! 
JOEY: Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire. 
THE GIRLS: No, not getting my bra! 
JOEY: If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call. 
PHOEBE: Okay, Monica’s are the biggest. 
MONICA: These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel. 
RACHEL: What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra. 
MONICA: All right then, your bra would still be big. 
RACHEL: No, I stuff outside the bra. 
CHANDLER: Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra. 
PHOEBE: All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine. 
RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there. 
CHANDLER: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us. 
PHOEBE: Okay, there. 
JOEY: Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous. 
CHANDLER: Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass. 
JOEY: And there you go! 
ALL: Oh, yeahhhhh!!! 
MONICA: Chandler!! 
CHANDLER: At least let me smoke it to the good part. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Oh, no! 
RACHEL: What, what’s it, what’s going on? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, this has happened before. 
RACHEL: So you know how to fix it? 
PHOEBE: Yep. Put more gas in. 
CAROL: Hi! 
ROSS: Hey. 
CAROL: Hey, what are you doing here? 
ROSS: Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home? 
CAROL: Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home. 
ROSS: Where’s Ben? 
CAROL: He’s sleeping. 
ROSS: Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time? 
CAROL: Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary. 
ROSS: Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January? 
CAROL: It’s not that kind of anniversary. 
ROSS: Ah! Oh. 
CAROL: Sooo!! Anyway... 
ROSS: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up. 
CAROL: Oh God, Ross I am so sorry. 
ROSS: Yeah, well. 
CAROL: Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night? 
ROSS: Oh yeah, I’d love that. 
CAROL: Oh, great! Me too. 
ROSS: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. 
PHOEBE: Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up. 
RACHEL: Great! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, what town are we near? 
MONICA: Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg? 
PHOEBE: Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on? 
RACHEL: Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27. 
PHOEBE: Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76? 
RACHEL: I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don’t do that. 
RACHEL: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us. 
MONICA: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up. 
RACHEL: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here! 
PHOEBE: But if... 
RACHEL: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else. 
PHOEBE: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back. 
MONICA: So the going for help went well? 
JOEY: Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed. 
CHANDLER: I have the lung capacity of a two year old. 
MONICA: Then why are you smoking? 
CHANDLER: Well it’s very unsettling. 
ROSS: ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan. 
CAROL: Ah, Susan will be so pleased. 
ROSS: 717? Where’s 717? Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right? 
CAROL: No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something. 
PHOEBE: Ross, thank God. 
ROSS: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering? 
PHOEBE: I ate a bug. 
MONICA: Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. 
PHOEBE: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck. 
ROSS: Oh, now you want a favour? 
PHOEBE: Yes, please. 
ROSS: Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay? 
CAROL: Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends. 
ROSS: No, I’m not gonna pick them up. 
CAROL: Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car. 
ROSS: No, Rachel doesn’t want me to.... 
CAROL: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you. 
ROSS: Yeah, you’re right. 
CAROL: Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?! 
ROSS: We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were.. ., yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. 
CAROL: You slept with another woman? 
ROSS: Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk. 
JOEY: Okay, done. 
MONICA: What’s ‘pleh’? 
JOEY: That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air! 
MONICA: Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards? 
RACHEL: Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!! 
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives! 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hey!! 
PHOEBE: Hi! 
RACHEL: What is he doing here?! 
ROSS: He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate. 
ALL: No! Come on! 
RACHEL: All right!! Fine! Fine. 
JOEY: Arrrghh!! 
CHANDLER: Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense! 
PHOEBE: You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing? 
CHANDLER: Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible. 
JOEY: Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along? 
MONICA: I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her? 
RACHEL: Ask me what? 
MONICA: Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing? 
CHANDLER, PHOEBE, AND JOEY: No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no. 
RACHEL: You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come. 
ROSS: Excuse me? 
CHANDLER: It’s horrible. 
ROSS: Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin? 
RACHEL: Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier. 
ROSS: Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills. 
MONICA: Here we go again. 
JOEY: I-I can’t handle this, you guys. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name. 
ROSS: All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready. 
RACHEL: All right, let’s go! 
ROSS: You’re welcome. 
RACHEL: Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else? 
ROSS: We were on a break! 
RACHEL: Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine! 
ROSS: Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me. 
RACHEL: What?! 
MONICA: I don’t know. 
ROSS: That’s what you said last night. 
MONICA: What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you! 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACHEL: Really Joey? 
JOEY: What? 
PHOEBE: Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here. 
RACHEL: No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here. 
ROSS: Obviously not to Joey. 
JOEY: What? 
ROSS: Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no. 
CHANDLER: Guys, guys, guess who I am?! 
PHOEBE: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other. 
JOEY: Yeah, and not put us in the middle. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
ROSS: I can. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported. 
JOEY: Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who? 
ROSS: Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go. 
JOEY: Come on man, you drove all the way up here. 
ROSS: No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
MONICA: All right, we’ll call you when we get back. 
ROSS: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. 
ROSS: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Or, or the rodeo!! 
ROSS: That would be great. 
PHOEBE: Okay! 
CHANDLER: I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure. 
ROSS: I know! 
PHOEBE: Bye!!! 
CAROL: Ugh. Ross! 
ROSS: Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping? 
CAROL: Ahh, nooo!! 
ROSS: Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp. 
CAROL: You’re a genius, Ross. 
ROSS: Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110? 
CAROL: Okay, I’ll pay you tomorrow. 
ROSS: Okay. 
CAROL: Okay, bye!! 
ROSS: So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know? 
CAROL: Yeah, okay, bye. 
ROSS: So I’m gonna take off then! 
MONICA: What’s so funny? 
JOEY: Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh. 
MONICA: Oh. 
JOEY: What-what’s so funny? 
GUNTHER: Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here. 
CHANDLER: Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one. 
GUNTHER: Okay, but only if you give me a drag. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
GUNTHER: Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. 
CHANDLER: No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one. 
CHANDLER: Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever. 
RACHEL: Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. 
CHANDLER: Oh. Nope, that patch is no good. 
RACHEL: Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since. 
ROSS: Pffhah. 
RACHEL: What’s your problem? 
ROSS: Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap. 
RACHEL: Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City. 
ROSS: Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay. 
RACHEL: Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks. 
PHOEBE: All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men. 
CHANDLER: Or what my Father called Thursday night. 
ROSS: Here you go. 
RACHEL: Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this. 
ROSS: Sorry. 
FRANK: Hi! 
PHOEBE: Oh my God!! 
FRANK: Hi! 
PHOEBE: Frank! Hi! 
FRANK: How are you? 
PHOEBE: What are you doing here? 
FRANK: Oh, well y'know, I would’ve called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn’t find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So... 
PHOEBE: What happened? 
FRANK: Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism. 
PHOEBE: But, also, what happened between you and your Mom? 
FRANK: Well, we got into a fight ‘cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married. 
PHOEBE: Your getting married?! 
FRANK: Oh, yeah! 
ALL: Wow! 
PHOEBE: My little brother’s getting married!! 
FRANK: Oh, I knew you’d be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her? 
PHOEBE: Do I? 
FRANK: Do you? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I do, yeah. 
FRANK: Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I’m gonna, I’m gonna get my ah, my fiancée man! 
CHANDLER: Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, isn’t it fantastic? 
MONICA: Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married? 
PHOEBE: What, he’s 18. 
ROSS: Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party. 
JOEY: Yeah, or-or to get a hooker. 
CHANDLER: Always illegal Joe. 
FRANK: Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight. 
ALICE: Y'know it-it’s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I’m a big surprise. 
MONICA: So, um, how-how did you guys meet? 
FRANK: Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class. 
ALICE: And he was my best student. 
FRANK: Yeah, she was my best teacher. 
ALICE: Ohhh. 
CHANDLER: If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will? 
ROSS: And so now you guys are gonna be married? 
ALICE: Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away. 
RACHEL: Oh my God!! Great! 
PHOEBE: Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that? 
FRANK: I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right? 
ALICE: Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us. 
PHOEBE: Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t. 
ALICE: Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter? 
HYPNOSIS TAPE: You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman. 
MONICA: And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. 
RACHEL: Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. 
MONICA: Pete, can I get you something else? 
PETE: Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out. 
MONICA: Haven’t you and I covered that topic? 
PETE: Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you. 
MONICA: Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food. 
PETE: Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you? 
RACHEL: Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. 
MONICA: I mean really, think about it. 
PETE: Ho-ho, I will. 
PHOEBE: No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong! 
ROSS: Pheebs, what, is it the age thing? 
PHOEBE: No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat! 
JOEY: Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it. 
PHOEBE: But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics. 
JOEY: Well, have-have you told him how you feel? 
PHOEBE: Yes. Not out loud. 
ROSS: Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it. 
ROSS AND JOEY: No-no-no-no-no. 
PHOEBE: Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?! 
ROSS AND JOEY: No. 
PHOEBE: Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. 
JOEY: So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, let’s just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass. 
RACHEL: I think you should definitely go out with this guy. 
MONICA: Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me. 
RACHEL: Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger? 
MONICA: Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids. All right, I get your point. 
RACHEL: All right. 
CHANDLER: Hi. 
MONICA: Hey. 
CHANDLER: Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick? 
MONICA: Uh, yeah. 
RACHEL: Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya? 
CHANDLER: Y'know what, pretty good. 
RACHEL: Yeah? 
CHANDLER: Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
MONICA: Here you go. 
CHANDLER: Thanks 
RACHEL: Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable. 
CHANDLER: What check thing? 
MONICA: As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him. 
CHANDLER: Pete Becker. Pete Is this him? 
MONICA: That’s Bill Clinton. 
CHANDLER: Who’s he huggin’? 
MONICA: Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete? 
CHANDLER: This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program! 
RACHEL: We use it!! 
CHANDLER: There you go!! 
RACHEL: Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire. 
MONICA: I’m not gonna go out with him. 
RACHEL: Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting. 
MONICA: Or incredibly offensive. 
RACHEL: Oh yeah, sure, that too. 
CHANDLER: What? 
ROSS: All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything. 
JOEY: Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88. 
FRANK: What, you don’t think I know that? 
JOEY: Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet! 
ROSS: Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that. 
FRANK: Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about. 
JOEY: Yeah, in a poem maybe. 
ROSS: No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel. 
FRANK: You don’t have it anymore? 
ROSS: No, I ah, I slept with someone else. 
FRANK: Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better? 
ROSS: It didn’t. 
FRANK: Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice. 
JOEY: Now, wh-what, what is that like? 
FRANK: It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her. 
ROSS: Yeah, yeah. 
JOEY: Why can’t I find that? 
ROSS: Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it! 
JOEY: Well, I want it! 
FRANK: You can have it! 
JOEY: I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me. 
ROSS: Oh, no! No! 
FRANK: It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it!! 
JOEY: Then you hold on to it!! 
FRANK: All right, man!! 
JOEY: All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! 
PHOEBE: You’re Frank’s best man?! 
JOEY: I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure. 
PHOEBE: Well then, what about you?! Huh?! 
ROSS: I’m the ring bearer. 
PHOEBE: Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. 
ALICE: Oh my God, who died on this?! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me? 
ALICE: Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to. 
PHOEBE: Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined. 
ALICE: Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw. 
PHOEBE: Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank. 
PETE: Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin. 
ALL: Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay. 
SECRETARY: You have a Miss Monica Geller here. 
PETE: Uh, absolutely, yeah, send her in. Hi. 
MONICA: What the hell is this? 
PETE: Hang on a second. I’ll-I’ll talk to you in the morning. I’m sorry what? 
MONICA: Seriously, what is this supposed to mean? 
PETE: Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip. 
MONICA: You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you? 
EMPLOYEE: Umm, I’m still here. 
PETE: You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us. 
MONICA: What?! 
PETE: Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights. 
MONICA: Okay, umm, you’re a loon. 
PETE: Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say? 
MONICA: I don’t know. 
PETE: Why not? 
MONICA: ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour. 
PETE: One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even. 
FRANK: Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me! 
PHOEBE: Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark? 
FRANK: Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right? 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day? 
FRANK: Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive. 
PHOEBE: What umm, what happened? 
FRANK: Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off. 
PHOEBE: Oh no. Did umm, did she say why? 
FRANK: Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best? 
FRANK: Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain! 
PHOEBE: Oh, sweetie, oh. 
FRANK: Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why! 
PHOEBE: Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay? 
FRANK: What? 
PHOEBE: Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will. 
FRANK: Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you? 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
FRANK: Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch. 
PHOEBE: Okay, but. 
FRANK: Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go. 
RACHEL: Oh my God! The millionaire’s here! 
CHANDLER: Oh my God! 
MONICA: Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay? 
CHANDLER: Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything. 
MONICA: I know!! 
CHANDLER: Okay, then get the lobster! 
MONICA: Hey! 
FRANK: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi!! 
JOEY: Hey! 
ROSS: Hi! 
JOEY: Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now? 
MONICA: And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. Bye. 
ALL: Oh-no-no-no-no…. 
RACHEL: Just one drink?! 
MONICA: So, where do you want to go? 
PETE: Hey, you like pizza? 
MONICA: Oh, that’s sounds great. 
PETE: I know a great little place. 
PETE: You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza! 
MONICA: Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire? 
PETE: Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that. 
MONICA: Why, how much is that? 
PETE: That’s about 60 cents. 
JOEY: Every night!! 
HYPNOSIS TAPE: You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. 
PHOEBE: Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can. 
ALICE: Hi Frank. 
FRANK: Hi, Mrs. Knight. 
ALICE: Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, but not just that. 
ALICE: Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less. 
PHOEBE: None the less. 
ALICE: None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want. 
PHOEBE: That’s right, exactly. All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. . 
HYPNOSIS TAPE: Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. 
JOEY: Joey’s your best friend. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants. 
GUNTHER: Here you go. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
GUNTHER: Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you’d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover. 
MARK: Hi! 
RACHEL: Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!! 
MARK: Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say. 
RACHEL: Oh, okay. 
MARK: I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’re not, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s what I’m doing, now. 
RACHEL: Wow! Umm.... 
GUNTHER: I dropped a cup. 
PETE: ...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying. 
MONICA: Oh, this is so great. 
PETE: Yeah, it was. 
MONICA: All right then. Bye. 
MONICA: Hello, people who do not live here. 
ALL: Hi! Hello! 
MONICA: I gave you a key for emergencies! 
PHOEBE: We were out of Doritos. 
ROSS: Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire? 
CHANDLER: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately. 
MONICA: He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!! 
ROSS: Still?! 
MONICA: Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything. 
CHANDLER: Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image? 
MONICA: Two. 
CHANDLER: Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight? 
JOEY: Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! 
ROSS: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play. 
MONICA AND PHOEBE: Oh. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you. 
THE DIRECTOR: Joe. How’s it going? 
JOEY: Good. Hey. 
KATE: Hi. 
JOEY: Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh? 
KATE: Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins? 
JOEY: Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni. 
KATE: Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. 
JOEY: So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh? 
KATE: Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class. 
JOEY: Oh, forget about it. She rocks! 
KATE: Where do I know you from? 
JOEY: Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat. 
KATE: No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm? 
JOEY: Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor. 
KATE: That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!! 
JOEY: See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting. 
KATE: Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie. 
JOEY: Yeah, that was real. 
PHOEBE: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out. 
RACHEL: I know. 
PHOEBE: What, so what are you gonna tell him? 
RACHEL: Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no. 
PHOEBE: Huh. 
RACHEL: I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something. 
PHOEBE: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father. 
RACHEL: I don’t have any issues with my Father. 
PHOEBE: Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then. 
JOEY: I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me. 
ROSS: Hello. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hey! 
ROSS: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute. 
JOEY: Wow, what-what do you think she wants? 
ROSS: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks. 
CHANDLER: It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive. 
ROSS: Then be supportive like a guy. 
CHANDLER: If I broke up with you, I’d miss you. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ROSS: You ah, wanted to see me? 
RACHEL: Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. 
ROSS: What?! 
RACHEL: Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here. 
ROSS: What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something? 
RACHEL: No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think? 
ROSS: Yes. 
RACHEL: Yeah? 
ROSS: Yes, I do. 
RACHEL: Good. 
ROSS: Yeah, I-I really do. Hey! This-this was a gift?! 
RACHEL: Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop. 
ROSS: It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop! 
RACHEL: Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug. 
ROSS: No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do. 
RACHEL: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt! 
ROSS: I’m just trying to help you, move on. 
RACHEL: Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty.... 
ROSS: Petty... 
RACHEL: Petty... 
ROSS: Petty... 
RACHEL: Petty... 
ROSS: Petty... 
RACHEL: Small... 
ROSS: Small... 
RACHEL: You are so just doing this out of spite. 
ROSS: Awwwahuh, no, no, no!! 
RACHEL: Huh? 
ROSS: I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! 
RACHEL: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore! 
ROSS: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah... 
RACHEL: yeah-yeah-yeah!! 
ROSS: Oh-oh, okay, okay! If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. You have a pleasant evening. 
PHOEBE: So, you’re like a zillionaire? 
CHANDLER: And you’re our age. You’re our age. 
PHOEBE: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself. 
PETE: What like Pete Dakota? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete. 
JOEY: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago. 
CHANDLER: That’s not a state Joe. 
JOEY: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is? 
PETE: I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later. 
ALL: Okay. 
CHANDLER: You’re our age! 
PETE: So ah, we on for tomorrow? 
MONICA: Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, kinda. 
KATE: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy? 
JOEY: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. Nothing. 
THE DIRECTOR: Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice. 
KATE: I have a question about this scene. 
THE DIRECTOR: Yes? 
KATE: Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor. 
THE DIRECTOR: Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking. 
JOEY: Yeah. 
KATE: I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that. 
JOEY: Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch. 
KATE: It doesn’t say that in the script. 
JOEY: It does in mine! 
CHANDLER: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you? 
ROSS: You bug me. 
CHANDLER: Is there any chance you didn’t see that? 
CHANDLER: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye! 
ROSS: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does! 
CHANDLER: You didn’t just break up. 
ROSS: Hey, it’s been like three weeks! 
CHANDLER: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower! 
ROSS: Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
ROSS: She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!! 
CHANDLER: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave. 
ROSS: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it! 
CHANDLER: Stop what?! 
ROSS: I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!! 
CHANDLER: No!! You can’t!! 
ROSS: Look, they must be stopped! 
CHANDLER: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong! 
ROSS: I need juice! People need juice!! 
CHANDLER: Look man! 
ROSS: People need juice! 
CHANDLER: Listen to me!! 
ROSS: Juice, I need... 
CHANDLER: She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over. 
ROSS: Yeah, okay. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
ROSS: It’s just I miss her so much. 
CHANDLER: I know. 
MARK: Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom? 
RACHEL: Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’ 
RACHEL: Y'know what? 
MARK: No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to. 
RACHEL: I can’t do this. 
MARK: Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know. 
RACHEL: Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you. 
MARK: Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here! 
RACHEL: Oh God. I’m sorry about this. 
MARK: That’s okay. 
RACHEL: You sure? 
MARK: Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself. 
SPOKESWOMAN: ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size... 
PETE: Hey, can I ask you something? 
MONICA: Sure. 
PETE: Where are we? 
MONICA: Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo. 
PETE: Just tell me the truth. 
MONICA: Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship. 
PETE: Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago? 
MONICA: So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean? 
PETE: Oh, yeah. I know that. 
MONICA: I so wanna be attracted to you. 
PETE: But you’re not. Okay, good. 
MONICA: I’m sorry. 
PETE: Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘cause it’s not so bad. 
MONICA: It’s not? 
PETE: I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently. 
MONICA: Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too. 
PETE: Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you wanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda depressing. 
SPOKESWOMAN: And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker. 
PETE: One second. 
CHANDLER: I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!! 
CHANDLER: I wasn’t doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now? 
JOEY: Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread! 
CHANDLER: Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth. 
JOEY: God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’ 
CHANDLER: I think somebody has a crush on somebody. 
JOEY: Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know? 
CHANDLER: I’m talking about you. You big, big freak. 
JOEY: Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind. 
CHANDLER: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now! 
JOEY: Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?! 
KATE: Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy? 
JOEY: Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. Nothing. 
THE DIRECTOR: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow. 
KATE: Well, that was ah... 
JOEY: Better? 
KATE: Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night. 
JOEY: Ah, Kate? 
KATE: Yeah? 
JOEY: You ah, you forgot your shoes. 
KATE: I’m probably gonna need those. Huh? 
JOEY: Hey, listen you ah.... 
KATE: Hmm? 
JOEY: ...feel like getting a cup of coffee? 
KATE: Umm. 
THE DIRECTOR: Kate? 
KATE: Yep. 
THE DIRECTOR: You ready to go? 
KATE: Yeah. 
THE DIRECTOR: Very nice. Very nice. 
KATE: So umm, I’ll see you tomorrow, huh? 
JOEY: Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight. 
PHOEBE: Hey! Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman... 
CHANDLER: ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name. 
PHOEBE: It isn’t? 
CHANDLER: No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man. 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man! 
RACHEL: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey, Rach, how was work? 
RACHEL: Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair. 
MONICA: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff. 
RACHEL: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... 
MONICA: Something wrong? 
RACHEL: No. Nothing. 
CHANDLER: So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have? 
PHOEBE: Okay well, he would turn things to gold. 
CHANDLER: What about things that are already gold? 
PHOEBE: Ahh, his work is done. 
CHANDLER: Okay, let’s play my game now. 
PHOEBE: Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! 
CHANDLER: Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?! 
JOEY: Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it’s like to be you? 
MONICA: Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh? 
JOEY: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart! 
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this! 
ROSS: Hey! 
ALL: Hey! 
ROSS: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away. 
MONICA: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
ROSS: We were all pretty shaken up about it. 
PHOEBE: Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way. 
ROSS: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person. 
MONICA: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? 
ROSS: You get the dollhouse. 
MONICA: I get the dollhouse! 
PHOEBE: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel. 
JOEY: Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse? 
PHOEBE: No, just a barrel. 
MONICA: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse. 
PHOEBE: Really?! Really?! 
MONICA: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with. 
CHANDLER: My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. 
RACHEL: Hey, Sophie! 
SOPHIE: Hey, Rach! 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
SOPHIE: Hey. 
RACHEL: Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here. 
CHANDLER: Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. 
RACHEL: Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office? 
CHANDLER: Yes, I realise that. 
RACHEL: Summer catalogue! 
CHANDLER: That’s the stuff! 
JOANNA: Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don’t work for me. 
RACHEL: Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna. 
JOANNA: Bing! That’s a great name. 
CHANDLER: Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you. 
JOANNA: Me too. 
RACHEL: Bye, Chandler. 
JOANNA: So ah, what’s wrong with him? 
RACHEL: Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore. 
JOANNA: Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone? 
RACHEL: No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone! 
JOANNA: Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it. 
RACHEL: Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too? 
JOANNA: Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do? 
SOPHIE: Uh, uh, uh, I am here. 
JOANNA: I know that. 
MONICA: Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hello. 
PHOEBE: Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful. 
MONICA: I know!!! 
PHOEBE: So, I’m here, ready to play. 
MONICA: Okay. 
PHOEBE: I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. 
MONICA: What’s this? 
PHOEBE: That’s a dog, every house should have a dog. 
MONICA: Not one that can pee on the roof. 
PHOEBE: Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. 
CHANDLER: And is this in case the house sneezes? 
PHOEBE: No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic. 
MONICA: I don’t want a ghost. 
PHOEBE: Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. 
ROSS: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen. 
PHOEBE: Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government. 
RACHEL: Hey! 
ALL: Hello. 
RACHEL: I need to talk to you! 
ROSS: Sure, what’s up? 
RACHEL: Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler. 
ROSS: I-I know. Well if something comes up... 
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase. 
RACHEL: Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you... 
CHANDLER: Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man! 
RACHEL: That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it. 
RACHEL: Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me. 
PHOEBE: Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof! 
MONICA: Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go. 
PHOEBE: Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination. 
ROSS: Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof! 
PHOEBE: The little ones do. 
JOEY: Hey, Kate! 
KATE: Morning. 
JOEY: Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week... 
THE DIRECTOR: Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! 
JOEY: And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah... 
WOMAN: Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy. 
JOEY: Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani. 
LAUREN: I know! I-I’m a big fan of yours. 
JOEY: What?! 
LAUREN: I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. 
JOEY: Get out of here, really?! 
LAUREN: Absolutely! 
JOEY: Yeah? 
LAUREN: Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft. 
JOEY: They gave me the shaft all right. 
LAUREN: Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something? 
JOEY: Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great. 
LAUREN: Cool! I-I’ll see you then. 
JOEY: All right. 
THE DIRECTOR: All right, it’s time to act, my talking props. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
ALL: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!! 
RACHEL: Wow!! 
PHOEBE: Look, look! 
ROSS: Hey, what’s this?! 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. 
MONICA: It’s very interesting, Phoebe. 
RACHEL: What’s this? 
PHOEBE: The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed. 
ROSS: This is the coolest house ever!! 
PHOEBE: Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? 
RACHEL: All right! 
ROSS: I would! 
MONICA: Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?! 
ROSS AND RACHEL: Uh-huh. 
PHOEBE: Watch, watch. 
ROSS AND RACHEL: Ooohhhh!! 
PHOEBE: And, and! 
ROSS AND RACHEL: Ahhhh!! 
CHANDLER: Hey, my Father’s house does that! 
RACHEL: O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. 
CHANDLER: Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. 
RACHEL: Hmm. 
CHANDLER: Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud! 
JOANNA: Chandler is fantastic!! 
RACHEL: What?! 
JOANNA: Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you? 
RACHEL: Oh, I.... 
JOANNA: Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a good heart? 
RACHEL: Oh, I know... 
JOANNA: Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through. 
SOPHIE: Isn’t this great?! 
JOANNA: Don’t spoil it. 
JOEY: Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say? 
THE DIRECTOR: Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! 
JOEY: That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway? 
KATE: He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating. 
JOEY: Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with? 
KATE: I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care? 
JOEY: Do you want me to want you to care? 
KATE: Do you? 
JOEY: What? 
THE DIRECTOR: Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off. 
JOEY: Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say? 
KATE: I’ve got no reason to stay. 
THE DIRECTOR: Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I’ll see you in the morning. 
KATE: I can’t believe we go on in, in a week. 
JOEY: Hey, it’s gonna be all right. 
LAUREN: Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs? 
JOEY: What? 
LAUREN: You know! At the place I told you about last night? 
JOEY: Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight. 
LAUREN: Oh, okay. 
JOEY: Okay. 
LAUREN: I’ll see you tomorrow. 
JOEY: Okay. 
LAUREN: G’night. 
JOEY: Ah, are you okay? 
KATE: Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh? 
JOEY: I don’t know. 
KATE: Well umm, maybe if it had more heat. 
JOEY: How do you mean? 
KATE: Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know? 
JOEY: Maybe he could slip her the tongue. 
KATE: Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up. 
JOEY: Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist. 
KATE: And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach! 
JOEY: And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her! 
KATE: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal.... 
JOEY: Something like that? 
KATE: Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind. 
JOEY: Yeah. 
JOEY: Hey. 
ROSS: Hi. 
JOEY: Hey. 
ROSS: Hi. 
JOEY: Hey. 
ROSS: It’s a little early to be drinkin’. 
JOEY: No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate. 
ROSS: Ohhhhh! 
MONICA: You’re kidding?! That’s great! 
JOEY: Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making... 
MONICA: Oh my. 
JOEY: Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. 
CHANDLER: I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’ 
RACHEL: Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her? 
CHANDLER: That’s what you say at the end of a date. 
RACHEL: You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’ 
CHANDLER: To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion. 
MONICA: Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you? 
RACHEL: Well, they always called. 
MONICA: Hmm, bite me. 
JOANNA: Did he call? 
RACHEL: No. Sorry. 
JOANNA: Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called? 
SOPHIE: Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women. 
JOANNA: Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why? 
RACHEL: Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. 
JOANNA: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward? 
RACHEL: Well... 
JOANNA: The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you? 
RACHEL: No. I... 
JOANNA: Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that. 
RACHEL: Call her! Call her now! 
CHANDLER: Multiple, so many paper cuts. 
RACHEL: Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy! 
CHANDLER: Oh, well give me the phone then. 
RACHEL: Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her! 
CHANDLER: Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’ 
RACHEL: Well then you’re going to have to take her out again. 
CHANDLER: Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye! 
RACHEL: I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! 
CHANDLER: All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again! 
RACHEL: That’s fine! 
CHANDLER: That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know. 
RACHEL: I know. 
ROSS: Mon? 
MONICA: I’m in the shower! 
ROSS: Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!! 
JOEY: Hey. 
KATE: Hi. 
JOEY: So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall? 
KATE: About what? 
JOEY: Y'know, about what happened with us. 
KATE: Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay? 
JOEY: What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress. 
KATE: Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you? 
JOEY: Nooo. 
LAUREN: Hi, Kate! 
KATE: Hi, Lauren. 
JOEY: Hi, Lauren. 
LAUREN: Hi, pig! 
ROSS: Sorry I ah, I scared you in there. 
MONICA: Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire. 
PHOEBE: What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?! 
ROSS: Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room. 
PHOEBE: All right. Did everyone get out okay? 
MONICA: Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate. 
PHOEBE: Ohh. What is this? 
ROSS: No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!! 
PHOEBE: Ohh, the-the Foster puppets! 
CHANDLER: It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, and it’s all the time. 
JOANNA: Well, thanks again for lunch. 
CHANDLER: Yes, this, this was pleasant. 
JOANNA: It was, wasn’t it? 
CHANDLER: The food there was, was great. 
JOANNA: Wasn’t it? 
CHANDLER: So take care. 
JOANNA: You too. 
CHANDLER: Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. 
JOANNA: Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages? 
RACHEL: Sophie’s desk. 
RACHEL: Chandler!! Are you gonna call her! 
CHANDLER: Noo! 
RACHEL: Chandler!! 
CHANDLER: Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry. 
RACHEL: Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. 
CHANDLER: Ahhhh--I’m not going to call you. 
JOANNA: What? 
CHANDLER: I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out. 
JOANNA: Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, o-okay. 
JOANNA: So... 
CHANDLER: Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime! 
JOEY: Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she’s not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too. 
RACHEL: So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates? 
MONICA: Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God, they took my idea! 
MONICA: That was you?! 
PHOEBE: Yeah! Okay, here you go. 
GUNTHER: Rachel, I made you a cocoa. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God, are you guys okay? 
GUNTHER: Are you all right? 
JOEY: Oh my. 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
JOEY: Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan. 
CHANDLER: Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate. 
JOEY: Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay? 
ROSS: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
ROSS: I’m gonna be on TV!! 
CHANDLER: No way! 
ROSS: Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it! 
CHANDLER: Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?! 
ROSS: Thanks. You ready to go? 
CHANDLER: Yeah. 
JOEY: Saw a girl with that vest. 
CHANDLER: Thanks. 
ANCHORWOMAN: While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won’t live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead. 
JOEY: Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute! 
PETE: Hi! 
MONICA: Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. 
PETE: Wow! Skates! 
MONICA: Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip? 
PETE: Well... 
MONICA: Oh, what’d ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee? 
PETE: Yeah, sure, that’d be great. 
MONICA: Regular or decaf? 
PETE: Ah, which ever is closest. 
MONICA: Okay. 
PETE: So ask me what I did today. 
MONICA: So what did you do today Pete? 
PETE: I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef. 
MONICA: What?! Oh. 
MONICA: Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant? 
RACHEL: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass? 
MONICA: I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me. 
RACHEL: And you’re still not attracted to him at all? 
MONICA: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade. 
RACHEL: Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher. 
MONICA: Oh, please. 
MONICA: What? Honey. 
RACHEL: Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday. 
MONICA: Oh God, I’m so sorry. 
RACHEL: I know. 
RACHEL: Ow!! 
MONICA: Oh God! 
ROSS: Hey, you guys! Guess what? 
RACHEL: Got a job on a river boat? 
ROSS: Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so... 
RACHEL: Oh I see, so this suit is making a point. 
ROSS: Right. 
RACHEL: Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like. 
ROSS: You like it right? 
MONICA: Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I’m kidding! 
RACHEL: Yeah, come here! 
MONICA: What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
RACHEL: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?! 
ROSS: Okay, good bye! 
CHANDLER: So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen. 
PHOEBE: Umm, oh, about three months. 
CHANDLER: Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in. 
JOEY: Hey!! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY: I got you something! Open it! Open it! 
CHANDLER: Okay. It’s a chicken. 
JOEY: It’s cute, huh? 
PHOEBE: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks? 
CHANDLER: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo. 
PHOEBE: Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love. 
JOEY: Oh, well no problem there. 
CHANDLER: Easy Lenny. 
PETE: So? I mean have you thought about it? 
MONICA: Okay. Here’s the thing. 
PETE: Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing? 
MONICA: I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me.... 
PETE: Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem. 
MONICA: Huh? 
PETE: No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip. 
MONICA: Oh? 
PETE: Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting. 
MONICA: Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you! 
PETE: I guess you can. 
MONICA: Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit! 
PETE: All right. 
MONICA: Okay. Can you give me a little push? 
PETE: Yeah, sure. Good luck! 
MONICA: I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! I’m okay!! I’m all right!! 
PHOEBE: Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman. 
PETE: What? 
PHOEBE: I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No? 
PETE: Why would you say that? 
PHOEBE: ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and... 
PETE: You’re good. You’re good! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift. 
PETE: Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though? 
PHOEBE: Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what? 
PETE: Thanks a lot. 
PHOEBE: No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks. 
CHANDLER: Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen. 
JOEY: Hey. 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
JOEY: How’s she doing? 
CHANDLER: She? 
JOEY: Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she? 
CHANDLER: I don’t know. I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly. 
JOEY: Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks. 
CHANDLER: Excuse me? 
JOEY: What? 
CHANDLER: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick! 
JOEY: Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep? 
CHANDLER: You don’t think I get up when you get up? 
JOEY: Ohhh, here it comes. 
CHANDLER: Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister! 
JOEY: Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day! 
CHANDLER: And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work? 
JOEY: That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant... 
CHANDLER: I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too? 
JOEY: I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick. 
CHANDLER: I’ll take her back tomorrow. 
JOEY: Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back? 
ROSS: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
ROSS: Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one? 
JOEY: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one. 
ROSS: Really? 
RACHEL: Oww! 
ROSS: Wow! That aspirin dance really works! 
RACHEL: Oww! 
ROSS: Oh my God, is that still... 
RACHEL: I’m fine, I’m fine. 
ROSS: No you’re not. 
RACHEL: Yes I am! 
ROSS: Rach! 
RACHEL: Look, I’m fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa! 
ROSS: Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay? 
RACHEL: No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet. 
ROSS: And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib! 
RACHEL: Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then. 
ROSS: Rach... 
RACHEL: But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready. 
ROSS: Rachel... 
RACHEL: Look, either help me or go. 
ROSS: Fine. I’ll go. 
RACHEL: Okay, but before you go, could you help me first? 
ROSS: Sure. I’ll help you. 
CHANDLER: Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?! 
RACHEL: Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? 
ROSS: Ohh. 
RACHEL: Okay. Let’s use this brush. 
ROSS: Okay. This stuff? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
ROSS: All right. 
RACHEL: Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. 
ROSS: Oke-dokey. 
RACHEL: Oh-ho! 
ROSS: Sorry. 
RACHEL: Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye! 
ROSS: Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close... 
RACHEL: Okay, just sweep it. 
ROSS: I’m sweeping... 
RACHEL: Right. 
ROSS: Sweep, sweep.... 
RACHEL: Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t... 
ROSS: What? What? 
RACHEL: We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle. 
ROSS: No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. What? 
RACHEL: Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this? 
ROSS: Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close... 
RACHEL: Blow it. 
ROSS: Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated. 
RACHEL: Sophisticated like a hooker? 
MONICA: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight. 
PHOEBE: What? 
MONICA: I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete. 
PHOEBE: Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you. 
MONICA: I know. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, I have to tell you something. 
MONICA: What? 
PHOEBE: But I can’t tell you. 
MONICA: Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me. 
PHOEBE: Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods. 
MONICA: Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel? 
PHOEBE: No. 
MONICA: Does it have to do with Joey? 
PHOEBE: No. 
MONICA: Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed? 
PHOEBE: No, but let’s come back to that later! 
ROSS: There you go! Good enough for your party, huh? 
RACHEL: Sure. 
ROSS: Yep? 
RACHEL: Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing. 
ROSS: Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay? 
RACHEL: Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed? 
ROSS: Sure, okay. 
RACHEL: Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around. 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I don’t want you to see me naked! 
ROSS: Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button? 
RACHEL: Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird. 
ROSS: Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want. 
RACHEL: What? 
ROSS: All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!! 
RACHEL: Ross! Stop that! 
ROSS: Ah, I’m sorry. 
RACHEL: Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more! 
ROSS: Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah! 
RACHEL: Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out! 
ROSS: Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king. 
RACHEL: Rosss... 
ROSS: Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal. 
RACHEL: All right. Fine. 
ROSS: Yowzah!!! 
RACHEL: O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay? 
ROSS: Aww, come on. 
RACHEL: That’s it. Ow!!! 
ROSS: Oh my God! 
RACHEL: Oh-ow! 
ROSS: All right. 
RACHEL: Ow! 
ROSS: Look... 
RACHEL: Ow! 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACHEL: Ow! 
ROSS: Rach? 
RACHEL: Ow! Ow! 
ROSS: Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay? 
RACHEL: Okay, I do. 
ROSS: Okay. 
RACHEL: I really do. 
ROSS: Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab. 
RACHEL: Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me? 
ROSS: Of course I am. I just have to make a call. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Okay? 
RACHEL: Thank you. Oww!!!! God! 
ROSS: What?! I wh-, what’s wrong? 
RACHEL: I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this. 
MONICA: Does it involve travel? 
PHOEBE: Noo! 
MONICA: Does it involve clogs? 
PHOEBE: Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws? 
MONICA: Clogs. 
PHOEBE: No. 
MONICA: Claws?! 
PHOEBE: No. 
MONICA: Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete? 
PHOEBE: No! 
MONICA: What is it?! What about Pete? 
PHOEBE: I don’t know! 
MONICA: Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me! 
PHOEBE: I can’t!! 
MONICA: Okay, I gotta go. 
PHOEBE: I, but you’re so close! No! 
MONICA: Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company? 
PHOEBE: Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it! 
CHANDLER: I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways. 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY: Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today. 
CHANDLER: I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? 
CHANDLER: If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine! 
JOEY: Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too. 
CHANDLER: Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals! 
JOEY: That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man. 
CHANDLER: Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way. 
CHANDLER: Ohhh-hoo, funny story! 
MONICA: I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners. 
PETE: So you like it? 
MONICA: Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. 
PETE: Oh, you’re welcome. 
MONICA: Did you just smell my hair? 
PETE: Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No. 
MONICA: Oh God. 
PETE: What? 
MONICA: You still have feelings for me don’t you? 
PETE: Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all. 
MONICA: Pete. 
PETE: Okay, I love you. Is that so bad? 
MONICA: No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice. 
PETE: Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that. 
MONICA: You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job. 
PETE: What? 
MONICA: And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry. 
PETE: Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay. 
MONICA: Okay, bye. 
PETE: I’m sorry things didn’t work out... 
MONICA: All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow! 
RACHEL: Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right? 
ROSS: Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray. 
RACHEL: Okay.

RACHEL: Oh my God! 
ROSS: Yeah. 
RACHEL: Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?

RACHEL: What’s Flimby’s? 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing. 
RACHEL: Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on! 
PHOEBE: No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!

PHOEBE: Like a date type person? 
ROSS: Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?

CAILIN: I’ll join you. 
TOMMY: I’ll get our seats.

MONICA: Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version. 
ESTELLE: Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! 
JOEY: Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle. 
ESTELLE: How do you do. Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! Did they have representation? 
JOEY: No, they-they weren’t in the play. 
RACHEL: We’re not actors. 
ESTELLE: Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face and her chest I could really put something together. 
CHANDLER: Could I borrow it? 
CAILIN: Hi! Remember me? 
ROSS: Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. 
CAILIN: Ross, I’m gonna go. 
ROSS: Go? Why? 
CAILIN: I don’t know. Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream. 
ROSS: But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream. 
CAILIN: Good bye Ross. 
ROSS: Uh, oh-ho bye. 
THE DIRECTOR: Here we go people! Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la, Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production. 
JOEY: Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha! 
THE DIRECTOR: Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is Thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother’s crab cakes! Excuse me!! 
JOEY: Anyone mind if I save this? 
MONICA: Hey! 
RACHEL: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Oh, is the play over? 
MONICA: Yeah. Where were you? 
HOLD VOICE: Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller. 
MONICA: You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.

PHOEBE: Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room. 
JOEY: Hey! Are you okay? 
KATE: Fabulous. 
JOEY: Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do? 
KATE: Become a drama critic! 
THE DIRECTOR: I am hurt! A plague on both your houses! 
KATE: By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review. 
JOEY: Oh, classy. 
KATE: Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this! 
JOEY: Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too. 
KATE: Really. What? 
JOEY: Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post. 
KATE: Why the Post? 
JOEY: Oh, you didn’t see the Post? 
KATE: No. You? 
JOEY: No. Why? 
KATE: So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me? 
JOEY: Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking. 
KATE: Oh, you’re sweet and cute. 
JOEY: I know! That’s why they trashed me! 
JOEY: Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
KATE: What? 
JOEY: I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again. 
KATE: What? So you never went out with an actress before? 
JOEY: Kate, do you even like me? 
KATE: Of course I do. 
JOEY: Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him? 
KATE: I don’t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy. Why can’t I just pick someone like you? 
JOEY: Thanks. 
KATE: You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you’re just so, you’re so, so. 
JOEY: Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let’s get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.

MONICA: Anyway, how did it go with Kate? 
JOEY: Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other! 
MONICA: Joey, you had the night! 
JOEY: What? 
MONICA: When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person! 
JOEY: You-you think? 
MONICA: Did you like learn about her family? 
JOEY: Two brothers, one died! 
MONICA: Yes!! 
JOEY: Yeah?! 
MONICA: Oh! 
GUNTHER: This is from the woman at the bar. 
CHANDLER: Oh-ho-ho-ho. 
GUNTHER: Sorry. She thought you were somebody else. 
RACHEL: What time is it? 
MONICA: One.

RACHEL: Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.

RACHEL: You don’t?! 
ROSS: No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him. 
RACHEL: Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men. 
ROSS: No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s, Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.

CHANDLER: Or... Dick. 
ROSS: Hey. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hey. 
ROSS: Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something. 
CHANDLER: Was it like a sneeze only better? 
ROSS: No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body. 
JOEY: What was it? 
ROSS: Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Whoa!!! 
CHANDLER: No!! 
ROSS: Come on you guys, it's no big deal! 
CHANDLER: Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh. 
ROSS: Well what is it? Is it a mole? 
JOEY: No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole. 
ROSS: Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple? 
CHANDLER: No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a... 
RACHEL: Hey guys! What's... 
CHANDLER: Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter. 
ROSS: Ahhh. 
JOEY: Yeah, right. 
PHOEBE: Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. 
VINCE: Good deal. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
VINCE: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Vince is a fireman. 
RACHEL: Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before? 
VINCE: 98 hot saves, highest in the force. 
CHANDLER: Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred. 
VINCE: Fire safety is not a joke, son. 
CHANDLER: You're right, I know. 
VINCE: Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday. 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
RACHEL: Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher. 
PHOEBE: Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight. 
RACHEL: What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you. 
PHOEBE: I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler. 
JOEY: So Pheebs, do they know about each other? 
PHOEBE: Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't. 
ROSS: Hey guys! 
JOEY: Hey. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
JOEY: Well?! 
CHANDLER: Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's? 
ROSS: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign. 
JOEY: Well what is it?! 
ROSS: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. 
CHANDLER: Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. 
ROSS: At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name. 
JOEY: Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross." 
ROSS: Yeah, that'd be cool! 
MONICA: Pete's breaking up with me. 
ALL: What?! 
MONICA: I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk. 
RACHEL: And? 
MONICA: Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad. 
JOEY: Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you. 
MONICA: Really?! 
JOEY: Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you. 
JASON: ...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life. 
PHOEBE: That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God! 
JASON: Whoa! 
PHOEBE: Oh my God!!! 
JASON: Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department! 
PHOEBE: No! No! 
JASON: No, no? 
PHOEBE: Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here! 
JASON: W-w-w-wait! Why?! 
PHOEBE: Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? 
ROSS: Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off! 
DR. RHODES: Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing? 
ROSS: Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple. 
DR. RHODES: Well that's not a third nipple. 
ROSS: No? 
DR. RHODES: First of all, it's on your ass. 
ROSS: Well then, what is it?! 
DR. RHODES: Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment? 
DR. JOHNSON: I'm with Hamilton! 
DR. RHODES: He's good with rear things, bring him in too. 
MONICA: I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants. 
CHANDLER: Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean. 
JOEY: Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them. 
PHOEBE: and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy. 
RACHEL: Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them? 
PHOEBE: Uh. 
JOEY: Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field? 
PHOEBE: Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field. 
RACHEL: So Pheebs, pick one of them. 
MONICA: Yeah. Which one do you like more? 
PHOEBE: Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. 
JOEY: Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. 
CHANDLER: Well sensitive is important, pick him. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 
JOEY: Oh sure, go with the sissy. 
PHOEBE: Jason is not a sissy! 
JOEY: Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler. 
ROSS: Y'know I have dinner plans!! 
DR. RHODES: Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped. 
ALL: Whoa. 
MONICA: Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command. 
ROSS: Yes, and the dimmer switch. 
JOEY: Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV. 
MONICA: No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything. 
CHANDLER: I-kea! This is comfortable. 
RACHEL: This place is amazing. 
PHOEBE: God, that is the nicest kitchen. 
MONICA: I know. 
PHOEBE: No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day. 
JOEY: Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook. 
MONICA: Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!

MONICA: Oh no-no-no, it's still me. 
PETE: Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.

JOEY: Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is? 
MONICA: Oh my. 
RACHEL: Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!! 
ROSS: Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom! 
PETE'S MOM: Hello. 
MONICA: And that's Pete's Mom. 
RACHEL: Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we’ve got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it. 
MONICA: Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose. 
CHANDLER: Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing. 
MONICA: Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy. 
ROSS: Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this. 
RACHEL: Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian! 
PHOEBE: All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince. 
CHANDLER: Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck! 
ALL: Good luck! 
RACHEL: OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet. 
PHOEBE: Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here? 
FIREMAN: Oh sure. Vince?! 
VINCE: Yo!! 
PHOEBE: Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those. 
VINCE: So, what’s up? 
PHOEBE: Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore. 
VINCE: Uh-huh. G-good deal. 
PHOEBE: I’m sorry. 
VINCE: No-no it’s okay. It’s just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and… That there’s so much in me I have to share with you yet. 
PHOEBE: Oh my God, I didn’t. 
VINCE: I’m sorry, I can’t talk. I’m gonna go write in my journal. 
PHOEBE: Wait-wait-wait! Wait!! 
PHOEBE: I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. 
ROSS: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory. 
MONICA: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. 
ROSS: Gimme this. 
RACHEL: Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist. 
MONICA: Brides magazines? 
RACHEL: Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. 
PHOEBE: Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing. 
MONICA: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy. 
RACHEL: Oh my God. 
MONICA: I know. I need more pie. 
PHOEBE: Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests? 
RACHEL: You didn’t break up with that fireman? 
PHOEBE: No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me. 
RACHEL: Wow! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal. 
MONICA: So then, are you going to dump Jason? 
PHOEBE: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and, Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so’s Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So, It’s really just about the math. 
PHOEBE: Jason? 
JASON: Yeah, come on in. 
JASON: So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong? 
PHOEBE: Nah-ha! 
GURU SAJ: You must be Ross. 
ROSS: Hi. 
GURU SAJ: I am Guru Saj. 
ROSS: Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so... 
GURU SAJ: Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I’ve attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let’s take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it’s a koondis! 
ROSS: What’s a koondis? 
GURU SAJ: I don’t know, what’s a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I’ve got a save that oughta shrink that right up. 
ROSS: I guess it’s worth a try. 
GURU SAJ: Oh sure, we should see results.Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! 
ROSS: What?! What?! 
GURU SAJ: We appear to have angered it. 
ROSS: We?! We angered it?! 
GURU SAJ: Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love. 
ROSS: Oh God! 
GURU SAJ: Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to.... 
ROSS: Ow!! 
GURU SAJ: Oops. 
ROSS: What was, what was that? 
GURU SAJ: Well it’s gone. 
ROSS: What?! How’s that? 
GURU SAJ: It got caught on my watch. 
ROSS: Hey! 
PETE: Lights. Uh, romantic lights. 
MONICA: Ooh, nice. 
PETE: So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about. 
MONICA: Oh, right! I completely forgot about that. 
PETE: Well ah, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life. 
MONICA: Yeah? 
PETE: And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world. 
MONICA: Wow. 
PETE: There’s one thing missing. 
MONICA: What’s that? 
PETE: It’s time for me to conquer the physical world. 
MONICA: Okay. 
PETE: Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion. 
MONICA: You wanna what?! 
PETE: I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states! 
MONICA: What are you talking about? 
PETE: Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed. 
MONICA: And I suppose you used a ring designer for that. 
PETE: Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think? 
MONICA: My parents will be so happy. 
PHOEBE: Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-- wear Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show. 
JASON: Hey. I was. 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
JASON: I was passin’ by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it’s kinda cool seeing you up there. 
VINCE: Whoa! Hey-hey! What’s going on here? Who is this guy? 
PHOEBE: I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince! 
VINCE: What?! 
JASON: What?! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible. 
VINCE: Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it’s okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive. 
JASON: Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break. 
PHOEBE: Really?! 
JASON: Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven’t been going out that long. Come on, we haven’t even slept together yet. Huh. 
VINCE: You haven’t? 
JASON: You have? 
PHOEBE: Well, this is none of my business. 
JASON: I-I can’t believe this! You-you’ve slept with him?! 
PHOEBE: Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park. 
JASON: Y'know Phoebe, I’m gonna make this real easy for you. 
PHOEBE: Well, that could’ve been really awkward. 
VINCE: You made him a candle light dinner in the park? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you. 
VINCE: Uh yeah, I can’t believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. 
CHANDLER: Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick? 
GURU SAJ: Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That’s supposed to be a duck right? ‘Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league. 
JOEY: Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do? 
GURU SAJ: Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat? 
CHANDLER: Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says "You’re in Sample." 
MONICA: Hey. 
ALL: Hey! 
RACHEL: How’d it go with Pete?! 
JOEY: Tell us! 
MONICA: You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over... 
BILLY CRYSTAL: I’m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded. Do you mind if we... 
ROBIN WILLIAMS: Yeah, could you scooch? 
BILLY: Yeah, move over just a little bit. 
ROBIN: Keep on scooching. 
MONICA: So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm... 
ROBIN: Why? Why?! What’s wrong with me?! 
BILLY: What’s the matter? 
ROBIN: I have a feelin’... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist. 
BILLY: How do you know? 
ROBIN: Well y'know, he’s got access. 
BILLY: Yeah. 
ROBIN: Y'know it’s that feeling you get, y'know? 
BILLY: Like when you go bowling and you know you’re in somebody else’s shoes? 
ROBIN: That’s the one. 
PHOEBE: All right, so, so you went to Pete’s... 
ROSS: What happened? 
MONICA: I... 
ROBIN: Why is this happening to me?! I don’t know, maybe it’s my wound. 
MONICA: Forget it. 
BILLY: So it’s-it’s not heeled yet? 
ROBIN: No-no, it’s ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any--Oh, there’s the cream. 
BILLY: Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else. 
ROBIN: What is it, Tim? 
BILLY: It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife. 
JOEY: So you’re the gynaecologist? 
BILLY: Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?! 
ROBIN: Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!! 
BILLY: Thomas, come back here! 
PHOEBE: So Monica, what were you gonna tell us? 
MONICA: I have no idea. 
RACHEL: So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker? 
PHOEBE: No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name. 
MONICA: He didn’t ask me to marry him. 
ALL: Ohh. 
PHOEBE: Well then definately don’t take his name. 
MONICA: He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy. 
THE GUYS: Pete?! 
RACHEL: Why?! What is it? 
MONICA: I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling. 
PHOEBE: Oh?! 
MONICA: Yeah, but without the costumes. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
JOEY: And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: "They’re are no rules." 
MONICA: So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff? 
ROSS: Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking. 
MONICA: What’s fish hooking? 
ROSS: Huh, what’s fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste? 
JOEY: What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath. 
DOUG: So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team. 
CHANDLER: Yes, but there’s two in martini, so everybody back to my office. 
DOUG: You! Chuckles! What’s your name? 
CHANDLER: Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah... 
DOUG: No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! 
ROSS: That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations. 
RACHEL: Yes!! 
CHANDLER: All right buddy, way to go! 
ROSS: Dude, what are you doing? 
CHANDLER: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal. 
PHOEBE: Yeesh, what’d you do about it? 
CHANDLER: Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom. 
MONICA: I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy. 
JOEY: Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. 
RACHEL: Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em. 
MONICA: Okay, can we please go eat? 
JOEY: Yeah. What are we getting? 
MONICA: Anything but stew. 
ROSS: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him. 
JOEY: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad? 
CHANDLER: What if Joey were president? 
PHOEBE: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
PHOEBE: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date? 
RACHEL: Oh, ah with who? 
PHOEBE: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it... 
RACHEL: Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again? 
PHOEBE: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald... 
RACHEL: Oh! That’s fine. 
PHOEBE: Great! Okay, good for you! 
HOSHI: You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half? 
PETE: I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training? 
HOSHI: It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get! 
MONICA: Hi! 
PETE: Monica! Hi honey. 
HOSHI: All right, on the table. 
MONICA: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you. 
PETE: Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter. 
MONICA: Promise me you’ll be careful. 
PETE: I promise. 
MONICA: Hey, are we still on for tonight? 
PETE: Yeah. 
MONICA: Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own... 
HOSHI: No! No boom-boom before big fight! 
MONICA: How ‘bout just a boom? 
RACHEL: Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies? 
PHOEBE: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. 
BONNIE: Hi! 
RACHEL: This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You’re Bonnie? 
BONNIE: I can show you an ID if you want? 
RACHEL: Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you. 
BONNIE: Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again. 
RACHEL: Oh, that must be it. 
PHOEBE: Well I hope you have fun tonight. 
BONNIE: Thanks! You too. 
RACHEL: You said she was bald. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now. 
RACHEL: How could you not tell me that she has hair? 
PHOEBE: I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people. 
RACHEL: Ohh, well, this is just perfect! 
PHOEBE: Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay. 
RACHEL: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head! 
PHOEBE: Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality. 
RACHEL: Why, does she have a bad personality? 
PHOEBE: Oh no, Bonnie’s the best! 
DOUG: Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team. 
CHANDLER: What is with him? 
PHIL: With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy! 
STEVENS: We never get smacked. 
CHANDLER: Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once. 
PHIL: Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me. 
STEVENS: I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall. 
DOUG: Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing? 
CHANDLER: No sir. 
DOUG: There you go. 
ROSS: Hey! 
MONICA: God Ross, what is that? 
ROSS: Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!! 
ANNOUNCER: From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!! 
MONICA: I love you, Pete!!! 
ANNOUNCER: And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!! 
MONICA: Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge! 
PETE: Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him. 
ROSS: Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble. 
ROSS: All right! You go get him! Let’s go! 
REFEREE: Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let’s get it on!! 
PETE: Uh-oh. 
MONICA: Hey! It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you. 
PETE: It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!" 
MONICA: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets. 
PETE: What, look back? 
MONICA: Well, you’re not gonna get going are you? 
PETE: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion? 
MONICA: Well, no. But... 
PETE: Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion. 
MONICA: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out! 
PETE: Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck. 
MONICA: You didn’t know that already? 
PETE: Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you. 
MONICA: Okay, just get a lot better. Fast. 
PETE: Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. 
MONICA: Yeah. That-that was the problem. 
MONICA: Hey. 
ROSS: Hey! How long until Pete’s fight? 
MONICA: Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. 
ROSS: Hot dog? 
MONICA: Four, please. I’m really nervous. Thank you. 
PHOEBE: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? 
ROSS: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific. 
PHOEBE: Ohh, that’s too bad! 
ROSS: No, I-I’m saying I liked her. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. 
ROSS: Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again. 
PHOEBE: Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? 
CHANDLER: Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger? 
ROSS: Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry. 
JOEY: Hey, the fight’s starting! 
ROSS: Okay, we’ll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? 
CHANDLER: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. 
JOEY: Fight’s over! 
CHANDLER: Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!! 
DOUG: Bing! You got those numbers for me? 
CHANDLER: No, I ah, I didn’t do them. 
DOUG: Oh, you forgot? 
CHANDLER: No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise. 
DOUG: Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy! Bing! 
CHANDLER: Doug!! 
DOUG: Hmm. 
CHANDLER: I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself. 
DOUG: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass! 
CHANDLER: No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock. 
DOUG: Oh? 
CHANDLER: Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous. 
DOUG: Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
DOUG: Ha! Ahhhhhhh! 
CHANDLER: Ahhhhh! 
PHOEBE: Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain? 
RACHEL: Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl. 
PHOEBE: No! No! Look at that! It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team! 
RACHEL: Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go. 
RACHEL: Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh... 
PHOEBE: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive. 
RACHEL: Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault. 
PHOEBE: You said it was okay! 
RACHEL: You said she was bald!! 
PHOEBE: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!! 
RACHEL: Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!! 
PHOEBE: Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross? 
RACHEL: Yes. 
PHOEBE: Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy? 
RACHEL: Yes. 
PHOEBE: So? 
RACHEL: I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! 
PHOEBE: Oh no. 
RACHEL: What? 
PHOEBE: Oh, we killed them all. 
RACHEL: Oh! 
PETE: It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine. 
MONICA: Please tell me you’re stopping now. 
PETE: I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror. 
MONICA: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up! 
PETE: I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid. 
MONICA: Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! 
PETE: Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt. 
MONICA: Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me. 
PETE: Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this. 
MONICA: Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. 
PETE: Mon-Monica? 
MONICA: Yes? 
PETE: Could you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now, and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow. 
DOUG: So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I’m happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn’t have done it without ya. 
CHANDLER: Thank you, sir. 
STEVENS: Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident. 
DOUG: Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya? 
CHANDLER: No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous. 
DOUG: Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you? 
CHANDLER: Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do! 
DOUG: Now get on out of here, you! 
TV ANNOUNCER: Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just... 
CHANDLER: Run! Run you crazy, rich freak! 
RACHEL: Oh, I can’t watch this. 
JOEY: Check it out, he’s winning! Pete’s winning! 
MONICA: Really?! 
JOEY: No-o-o!! 
TV ANNOUNCER: Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area. 
ALL: Oh! Oh! 
PHOEBE: Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? 
ROSS: Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t. 
ALL: Ohh!! 
CHANDLER: So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?! 
BONNIE: All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out. 
CHANDLER: Tell it again. Seriously. 
RACHEL: I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex? 
JOEY: Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography. 
MONICA: Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in. 
JOEY: Well, I think we all learned something. 
PHOEBE: Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look. 
CHANDLER: Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965. 
PHOEBE: Y'know what that means? 
JOEY: That you're actually 50? 
PHOEBE: No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever. 
ALL: Oh! 
RACHEL: That is so cool. 
PHOEBE: I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach? 
ALL: Yeah! Yeah, we can! 
BONNIE: Shoot! I can't go, I have to work! 
ROSS: That's too bad. 
RACHEL: Ohh, big, fat bummerrr. 
PHOEBE: So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk. 
JOEY: Hey, Bonnie had sex there! 
MONICA: Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid. 
CHANDLER: You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook. 
MONICA: Thanks! 
CHANDLER: Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend. 
MONICA: Yeah right. 
CHANDLER: Why is that so funny? 
MONICA: You made a joke right? So I laughed. 
CHANDLER: Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material? 
MONICA: Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like "Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey." 
MONICA: Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice. 
JOEY: Hey! 
MONICA: Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food! 
JOEY: No, it's just my luggage. 
CHANDLER, MONICA, AND JOEY: Hey!! 
JOEY: Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah! 
PHOEBE: Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house. 
ROSS: Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma. 
RACHEL: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY: Hey-hey, check out the hat! 
CHANDLER: What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!! 
MONICA: Seriously, where did you get the hat? 
RACHEL: Ross gave it to me. 
ROSS: Yeah, I think she looks good. 
RACHEL: Ohh, thank you. 
CHANDLER: Buy it for ya, or win it for ya? 
RACHEL: Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back. 
PHOEBE: And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat. 
ROSS: Go, go, go! 
RACHEL: Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! 
PHOEBE: Oy!! 
MONICA: What's with all this sand? 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. 
ROSS: Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat. 
PHOEBE SR: Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there. 
PHOEBE: Knock, knock, knock. 
PHOEBE SR: Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back. 
PHOEBE: Are you ah, Phoebe Abott? 
PHOEBE SR: Ahh, yes. 
PHOEBE: Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter! 
PHOEBE SR: You're Erwin's daughter?! 
PHOEBE: No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember? 
PHOEBE SR: Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be? 
PHOEBE: Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess. 
PHOEBE SR: Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank. 
PHOEBE: Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy. 
PHOEBE SR: Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria! 
PHOEBE: No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. 
PHOEBE SR: Oh. 
PHOEBE: Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him? 
PHOEBE SR: Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school. 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything. 
PHOEBE SR: Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us. 
PHOEBE: Oh, what? What was it? 
PHOEBE SR: The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, no, it was great. 
JOEY: Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is? 
MONICA: What?! 
JOEY: I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.

MONICA: Aww, thank you.

RACHEL: Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before. 
ROSS: Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No! 
RACHEL: Yes! 
ROSS: Get away! 
RACHEL: Just once! 
ROSS: Stay away! 
RACHEL: Take it like a man, Ross! 
ROSS: No! No! 
RACHEL: Oh, come on! 
CHANDLER: Big bullies!! 
ROSS: Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no! 
PHOEBE: Oh, hey!

MONICA: So what's Phoebe like? 
PHOEBE: I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like? 
MONICA: Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see. 
PHOEBE: Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is. 
JOEY: What? 
RACHEL: Really?! 
MONICA: Oh well, where is he?! 
PHOEBE: She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now? 
MONICA: Totally familiar. 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah. 
THE GUYS: Yeah! 
MONICA: Well, why would she lie to you? 
PHOEBE: I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored? 
ALL: Ohh!! 
CHANDLER: Yes! 
PHOEBE: All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.

CHANDLER: Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker. 
JOEY: OH YES!!!!! 
MONICA: Strip Happy Days Game? 
JOEY: Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff. 
ROSS: Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah. 
PHOEBE: Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited. 
ROSS: Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.

JOEY: All right, relax. It's just a shoe. 
ALL: Wooooo!!!! 
RACHEL: Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers! 
JOEY: Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you. 
PHOEBE: Come on, take 'em off!! 
JOEY: Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff? 
RACHEL: All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas! 
ROSS: Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk? 
RACHEL: I'm just making margaritas. 
ROSS: Okay. 
MONICA: I think I'll help her out. What is going on here? 
RACHEL: What?! 
MONICA: You painting his toenails? 
RACHEL: Oh, come on! 
MONICA: Chasing him all around the room? 
RACHEL: Monica, please? 
MONICA: He's totally flirting with you too. 
RACHEL: He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something... 
BONNIE: Hey! 
ROSS: Hey! Hi Bonnie! 
BONNIE: Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train. 
ROSS: Oh. 
BONNIE: What are you guys doing?! 
JOEY: We're playing Strip Happy Days Game! 
BONNIE: Cool! I'll catch up! 
CHANDLER: So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material? 
MONICA: Huh? 
CHANDLER: I saw you checking me out during the game last night. 
MONICA: You didn't even take off your pants. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, lucky for you. 
MONICA: What? 
CHANDLER: I don't know. 
RACHEL: Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?! 
PHOEBE: Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep. 
PHOEBE: After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm. 
RACHEL: Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night? 
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house. 
ROSS: Good morning. 
ALL: Hey. 
BONNIE: Hey! How did everybody sleep? 
RACHEL: Oh, great. 
MONICA: Like a log. 
ROSS AND BONNIE: Us too. 
RACHEL: I'm going for a walk. 
ROSS: Good morning. Nice breasts by the way. 
BONNIE: Hey, what happened to you? 
RACHEL: Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading. 
BONNIE: Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off. 
RACHEL: Ohhhh, sorry I missed that. 
BONNIE: Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny. 
RACHEL: Ohh-ha-ha! 
BONNIE: I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head. 
RACHEL: Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald. 
BONNIE: Really?! 
RACHEL: Ohh! 
BONNIE: Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime. 
RACHEL: Really?! 
BONNIE: Yeah! 
RACHEL: I mean you definitely should do that. 
BONNIE: Y'know what, I should do it. 
RACHEL: Yeah! 
BONNIE: Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool. 
RACHEL: Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head! 
BONNIE: All right. 
JOEY: What's the matter, Pheebs? 
PHOEBE: She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me! 
JOEY: What?! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me. 
RACHEL: Aww Pheebs, that sucks! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet. 
CHANDLER: Where ya going? 
PHOEBE: Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is. 
ROSS: Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering. 
PHOEBE: Well, are any of those people here?! 
ALL: Oh, no!! No, no! 
PHOEBE: Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays. 
BONNIE: Hey, everybody! 
ALL: Wow!! 
ROSS: Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did! 
BONNIE: You wanna touch it? 
ROSS: Nooo, but it, but it's great. 
BONNIE: Come on, touch it! 
ROSS: Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi! 
ROSS: I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you! 
RACHEL: That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge. 
ROSS: She said you gave her the razor! 
BONNIE: Hey guys. 
RACHEL: Hey! 
BONNIE: So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean? 
ROSS: Ahh, no, I'm good. 
BONNIE: Okay, I'll see you in a bit. 
ROSS: Okay, have fun! Wooo!! 
RACHEL: Come on see, she doesn't look that bad. 
ROSS: You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!! 
RACHEL: I don't know. 
ROSS: You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend! 
RACHEL: All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else? 
ROSS: Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember? 
RACHEL: Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! 
ROSS: You still love me? 
RACHEL: Noo. 
ROSS: You still love me. 
RACHEL: Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me! 
ROSS: Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together? 
RACHEL: Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so... 
ROSS: What?! 
RACHEL: I just, I feel, I-I just... 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I feel... 
CHANDLER: Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!

PHOEBE: Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh! 
PHOEBE: No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise! 
PHOEBE SR: I saw you break in!! 
PHOEBE: I'm sorry. 
PHOEBE SR: What are you doing here?! 
PHOEBE: I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays. 
PHOEBE SR: What?! 
PHOEBE: Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth! 
PHOEBE SR: All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. 
PHOEBE: My Father is Chuck Magioni? 
PHOEBE SR: No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth. 
PHOEBE: Oh. 
PHOEBE SR: But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother. 
PHOEBE: Heh? 
PHOEBE SR: Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and... 
JOEY: I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together! 
ROSS: That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing. 
CHANDLER: Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship...... 
ROSS: I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss! 
BONNIE: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Ahhhh! 
BONNIE: You guys, the water's great. You should really go in. 
CHANDLER: Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&amp;M. 
BONNIE: Okay, well g'night. 
ROSS: Good night. 
BONNIE: Don't be too long. 
ROSS: Okey-dokey! 
CHANDLER: There is not one hair on that head. 
ROSS: Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again? 
JOEY: So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on. 
ROSS: Yeah. 
JOEY: Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight? 
ROSS: Hi. 
CHANDLER: Hi there. 
MONICA: That's that weird voice again. 
CHANDLER: Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear! 
CHANDLER: Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
