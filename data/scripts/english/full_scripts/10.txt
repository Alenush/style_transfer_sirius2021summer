MONICA: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
CHANDLER: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
MONICA: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
CHANDLER: You're on!
PHOEBE: Hey!
MONICA: What's up?
PHOEBE: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
ROSS: ... finally...
PHOEBE: Is that Ross?
MONICA: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
PHOEBE: Sounds like he's with someone.
CHANDLER: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
MONICA: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
ROSS: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
MONICA: Oh my God, that's Charlie!
CHANDLER: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
PHOEBE: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
MONICA: I'm not sure about this.
PHOEBE: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
MONICA: No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
RACHEL: I know, I'm her!
PHOEBE: Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
MONICA: What?
PHOEBE: Get over here!
RACHEL: ooh...
CHANDLER: Wow!
MONICA: Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
MONICA: Thank you.
RACHEL: Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
JOEY: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
RACHEL: What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
MONICA: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
CHANDLER: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
MONICA: I'm on it!
CHANDLER: Anything?
MONICA: I think I hear curtains closing...
PHOEBE: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
MONICA: Bedsprings, unmistakable!
CHANDLER: You do realise that's your brother?
MONICA: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
CHANDLER: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
MONICA: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
CHANDLER: Okay Buckwheat!
PHOEBE: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
ROSS: Weh...*sigh*
ROSS: Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
ROSS: No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
ROSS: Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
PHOEBE: That's the door. He's gone...
CHANDLER: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
MONICA: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
ROSS: Hey, what are you guys doing?
PHOEBE: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
MONICA: Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
CHANDLER: Bye!
ROSS: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
CHANDLER: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
ROSS: Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
CHANDLER: You got it!
ROSS: Thanks! Thank you!
MONICA: Other wall, people! Other wall!
ROSS: Rach, you there?
JOEY: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
RACHEL: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
JOEY: No idea what it means.
RACHEL: Oh... okay, just hide!
ROSS: Rach?
RACHEL: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
RACHEL: There's no room under the bed.
ROSS: Is everything okay?
RACHEL: Yeah...
ROSS: Hey.
RACHEL: Hi...
ROSS: You know where Joey is?
RACHEL: ...I really don't...
ROSS: Can I talk to you for a minute?
RACHEL: Yeah, sure...
JOEY: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
PHOEBE: Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
ROSS: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
RACHEL: Uh-huh... right... yeah...
ROSS: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
RACHEL: Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
ROSS: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
RACHEL: That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
ROSS: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
RACHEL: You would think!
RACHEL: Joey!
JOEY: Is he gone?
RACHEL: How are you doing this?
JOEY: Pssst...
RACHEL: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
PHOEBE: Now, what is this?
RACHEL: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
PHOEBE: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
JOEY: Well, he's with Charlie now.
MONICA: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
JOEY: You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
RACHEL: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
CHANDLER: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
RACHEL: Sure...
CHANDLER: Enunciate!
RACHEL: Get out!
RACHEL: Are they right?
JOEY: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
RACHEL: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
JOEY: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
RACHEL: Although...
JOEY: I like although!
RACHEL: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
JOEY: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
RACHEL: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
JOEY: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
RACHEL: No...
JOEY: I'm thinking about you...
RACHEL: Yeah...
JOEY: Let's forget about Ross...
RACHEL: Forgotten.
JOEY: What's wrong?
RACHEL: Nothing...
RACHEL: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
RACHEL: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
JOEY: Well, maybe I can help.
JOEY: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
ROSS: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hey!
ROSS: You guys ready to go?
CHANDLER: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
ROSS: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
CHANDLER: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
ROSS: Learn about Jesus...
ROSS: Hey!
ROSS: Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
ROSS: Stop it!
ROSS: You're filthy!
PHOEBE: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
ROSS: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
MONICA: Check it out!
CHANDLER: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
MONICA: What do you think?
CHANDLER: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
MONICA: Don't you just love it?
ROSS: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
ROSS: You've never said that in your life, have you?
ROSS: I thought so.
MONICA: And listen to this...
CHANDLER: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
JOEY: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
CHANDLER: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
JOEY: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
ROSS: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
JOEY: I understand...
ROSS: No, I'll do it.
CHANDLER: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
PHOEBE: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
PHOEBE: Aaah... you're not good at this...
PHOEBE: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
PHOEBE: What?
PHOEBE: Why not?
PHOEBE: You have a... You have a date? With who?
PHOEBE: You have... have a girlfriend?
PHOEBE: For how long?
PHOEBE: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
PHOEBE: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
PHOEBE: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
ROSS: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
RACHEL: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
JOEY: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
RACHEL: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
JOEY: Ooh...
RACHEL: Still nervous?
JOEY: I'm gonna get the lasagna.
ROSS: Hey Rach...
RACHEL: Yeah!
ROSS: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
ROSS: Hey!
JOEY: Hey!
ROSS: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
JOEY: Yeah?
ROSS: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
JOEY: You kissed.
ROSS: Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
JOEY: I saw you.
ROSS: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
JOEY: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
ROSS: What?
JOEY: It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
ROSS: Are you serious?
JOEY: Yeah... Now I have something...
ROSS: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
JOEY: Oh... uh... look... before you...
ROSS: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
JOEY: I am those things, yeah.
ROSS: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
JOEY: Dude!
ROSS: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
JOEY: I can't think of anything.
ROSS: Thanks!
JOEY: Yeah.
RACHEL: So hi!
ROSS: Hi!
RACHEL: So you eh, you talked to Joey?
ROSS: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
RACHEL: Oh! That's great!
ROSS: Yeah!
RACHEL: Oh, so everything's okay?
ROSS: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
RACHEL: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
ROSS: Well, I'm so excited about this.
RACHEL: Really? Excited?
ROSS: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
RACHEL: Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
JOEY: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
RACHEL: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
JOEY: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
PHOEBE: Hi, Mike's place.
PHOEBE: Ooh, that was fast.
PHOEBE: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
PHOEBE: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
PHOEBE: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
PHOEBE: I... I'm Phoebe.
PHOEBE: Enchanté
MONICA: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
CHANDLER: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
MONICA: Yeah!
CHANDLER: So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
MONICA: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
CHANDLER: What are you singing?
MONICA: It's "Bolero" from "10".
MONICA: You what? You said you liked them.
CHANDLER: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
MONICA: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
CHANDLER: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
MONICA: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
CHANDLER: Hit yourself in the tooth?
MONICA: And the eye!
RACHEL: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
ROSS: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
RACHEL: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
ROSS: Okay, shoot!
RACHEL: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
RACHEL: What? What is it?
ROSS: Oh, major shampoo explosion!
RACHEL: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
RACHEL: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
ROSS: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
RACHEL: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
ROSS: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
RACHEL: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
PHOEBE: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
PHOEBE: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
PHOEBE: Well, I don't...
PHOEBE: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
PHOEBE: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
PHOEBE: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
PHOEBE: Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
PHOEBE: You're welcome!
CHANDLER: Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
MONICA: Not really.
MONICA: I have a problem.
CHANDLER: Really? What happened?
MONICA: Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
CHANDLER: You can't move at all?
MONICA: Oh, well, I can move...
CHANDLER: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
MONICA: I guess so...
CHANDLER: Some of these look a little frayed.
MONICA: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
JOEY: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi!
JOEY: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
RACHEL: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
JOEY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
RACHEL: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
JOEY: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
RACHEL: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
JOEY: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
RACHEL: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
JOEY: Yeah! Good night!
RACHEL: Goo--ood night!
JOEY: Good night!
RACHEL: Seriously, good night!
JOEY: Stop saying good night.
RACHEL: Okay.
MONICA: Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
CHANDLER: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
MONICA: Sure, what do you have in mind?
CHANDLER: I think you know.
MONICA: Really? I don't really feel like it.
CHANDLER: This is what I want to do.
MONICA: Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
JOEY: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
RACHEL: We weren't doing anything!
JOEY: Rach, he just saw us.
RACHEL: Shhh.
JOEY: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
RACHEL: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
RACHEL: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
JOEY: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
RACHEL: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
JOEY: Yeah, but it did happen, so...
JOEY: Ross?
RACHEL: Ross? Can we just close the door?
RACHEL: Ross, say something. Anything.
ROSS: So you two are..?
ROSS: And have you .. ed?
JOEY: No, no, no!
RACHEL: No, no, no!
ROSS: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
JOEY: Probably.
JOEY: No, no!
RACHEL: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
ROSS: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
RACHEL: No, but you know what I mean.
ROSS: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
JOEY: Really?
ROSS: Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
JOEY: Ross..
ROSS: It's all working out! Me &amp; Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
RACHEL: Calm ourselves?
ROSS: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
JOEY: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
ROSS: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
JOEY: I do like fajitas.
MONICA: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
CHANDLER: There's a hair in my coffee.
PHOEBE: Hey guys!
MONICA: Hey.
PHOEBE: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
CHANDLER: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
MONICA: That's sweet. Drink your hair.
PHOEBE: Hey, what's all this stuff?
MONICA: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
PHOEBE: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
MONICA: That's not really how it works.
PHOEBE: Oh, how does it work?
MONICA: I don't know!
PHOEBE: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
MONICA: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
PHOEBE: Hey!
PHOEBE: Good to see you.
MONICA: Hi Frank.
MONICA: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
MONICA: Which one is which again?
JOEY: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
RACHEL: Well, what would we be doing?
JOEY: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
RACHEL: Feel me up?
JOEY: In a carriage!
JOEY: Hey, Charlie!
RACHEL: Hey.
RACHEL: Oh, you bet.
JOEY: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
JOEY: Oh. Oh, thanks.
JOEY: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
ROSS: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
RACHEL: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
ROSS: Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
JOEY: Uh, actually, that's..
ROSS: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
ROSS: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
JOEY: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
ROSS: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
PHOEBE: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
PHOEBE: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
PHOEBE: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
PHOEBE: That's a, that's a long time.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
PHOEBE: What?
PHOEBE: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
PHOEBE: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
MONICA: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
CHANDLER: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
CHANDLER: I mean, you have a lovely home.
MONICA: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
MONICA: Oh my god!
MONICA: Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
CHANDLER: That's great. Can I see the book?
CHANDLER: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
MONICA: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
MONICA: Can I adopt you?
CHANDLER: Hey, you must be Owen.
CHANDLER: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
CHANDLER: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
CHANDLER: You know how to use a compass?
CHANDLER: You do? That's fantastic!
CHANDLER: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
CHANDLER: What?
CHANDLER: I got nothing.
ROSS: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
RACHEL: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
ROSS: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
JOEY: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
ROSS: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
RACHEL: No awareness.
ROSS: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
ROSS: My fajitas!!
RACHEL: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
ROSS: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
RACHEL: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
ROSS: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
PHOEBE: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
PHOEBE: Insane.
PHOEBE: Alice would never go for it, right?
PHOEBE: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
PHOEBE: Frank Jr.Jr.?
PHOEBE: Uh-huh.
PHOEBE: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
PHOEBE: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
PHOEBE: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
PHOEBE: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
PHOEBE: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
CHANDLER: Where are Bill and Colleen?
MONICA: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
CHANDLER: We have to leave!!
MONICA: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
CHANDLER: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
MONICA: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
CHANDLER: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
CHANDLER: See? Intuitive!
CHANDLER: Which technically now you should give back!
CHANDLER: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
ROSS: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
RACHEL: Ooy.
ROSS: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
RACHEL: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
ROSS: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
JOEY: Dude, are you okay?
ROSS: Totally.
RACHEL: Ross, you don't seem okay.
ROSS: No!
ROSS: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
ROSS: Okay.
RACHEL: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
ROSS: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
RACHEL: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
ROSS: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
RACHEL: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
ROSS: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
ROSS: I don't even know what that's for.
JOEY: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
RACHEL: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
JOEY: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
RACHEL: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
JOEY: It doesn't look good, does it?
JOEY: Morning. Here you go.
ROSS: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
JOEY: Yeah.
ROSS: So you took off my pants and shoes?
JOEY: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
ROSS: What do you mean?
JOEY: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
ROSS: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
JOEY: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
ROSS: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
JOEY: That's what I hear, yeah.
ROSS: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
JOEY: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
ROSS: Joey.
JOEY: I'm crazy about her.
ROSS: And she feels the same way?
JOEY: I think so.
ROSS: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
JOEY: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
ROSS: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
JOEY: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
ROSS: Yeah, I'm sure.
JOEY: And we're okay?
MONICA: Hey, Phoebs
PHOEBE: Hey.
MONICA: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
CHANDLER: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
MONICA: What?
PHOEBE: Still, he had to find out sometime.
CHANDLER: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
JOEY: Yeah. It's actually our first official date
CHANDLER: Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
JOEY: Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
CHANDLER: What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
JOEY: It's OK!
CHANDLER: How can you be so confident?
JOEY: Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
CHANDLER: Really? Like you have a routine?
JOEY: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
CHANDLER: Really?
JOEY: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
CHANDLER: You mean like this?
JOEY: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
CHANDLER: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
JOEY: More foosball?
ROSS: WOW!
CHANDLER: Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
ROSS: I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
CHANDLER: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
ROSS: Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
ROSS: Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
CHANDLER: Why...why?
ROSS: Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
CHANDLER: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
ROSS: So, do you get colours or just French tips?
ROSS: Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
PHOEBE: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hey Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
CHANDLER: Who's Amanda?
CHANDLER: Are you trying to do a British accent?
CHANDLER: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
PHOEBE: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
PHOEBE: Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
PHOEBE: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
PHOEBE: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
CHANDLER: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
ROSS: Well... I like how you look, what are you?
ROSS: Two, I think a two.
ROSS: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
ROSS: Well, I have a PhD, so...
ROSS: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
ROSS: You sprayed my front twice!
JOEY: I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
RACHEL: So.
JOEY: Yeah.
JOEY: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
RACHEL: I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
JOEY: What’s the matter?
RACHEL: I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!
RACHEL: Ok, so sorry.
RACHEL: I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!
JOEY: I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
RACHEL: Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
JOEY: Ok.
JOEY: Uh, was that good for you?
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
PHOEBE: Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
PHOEBE: Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
CHANDLER: Hello? Is someone on the line?
CHANDLER: Hang on, she’s right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
CHANDLER: I get pedicures!
PHOEBE: Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
PHOEBE: Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
PHOEBE: I did!
RACHEL: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
JOEY: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
RACHEL: Ok, let’s work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
JOEY: Ok, yeah, got it.
JOEY: This thing welded shut?!
RACHEL: Okay.
JOEY: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
RACHEL: Oh!
RACHEL: Ow!
JOEY: Sorry!
RACHEL: Well this is romantic!
JOEY: I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
RACHEL: It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
JOEY: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
RACHEL: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
JOEY: NAH! I don't have another level!!
ROSS: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
ROSS: Oh! And it gets worse!
CHANDLER: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
ROSS: How do you count to five?
ROSS: Damnit!
RACHEL: oooh! Oh oh!
ROSS: I Know!
RACHEL: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
CHANDLER: How was your date with Joey?
RACHEL: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
CHANDLER: You didn't like that?
RACHEL: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
RACHEL: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
RACHEL: Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
JOEY: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
RACHEL: No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
CHANDLER: You don't know!
PHOEBE: Hey!
PHOEBE: No.
PHOEBE: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
PHOEBE: Are you kidding, I love it!
PHOEBE: Hi!
PHOEBE: Musty!
PHOEBE: Well...kinda.
PHOEBE: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
PHOEBE: Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
JOEY: Hey!
RACHEL: Hey! Got champagne?
JOEY: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
RACHEL: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
JOEY: Uh!
RACHEL: Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
JOEY: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
RACHEL: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
JOEY: Oh! yeah!
RACHEL: You like that? Let's take this into high gear
JOEY: uh uh!
RACHEL: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
JOEY: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
RACHEL: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
JOEY: Soldier down!
CHANDLER: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
PHOEBE: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
PHOEBE: Please, Monica? In the hall?
CHANDLER: Well, aren't you a treat.
PHOEBE: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
PHOEBE: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
PHOEBE: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
PHOEBE: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I guess you're right.
ROSS: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
ROSS: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
ROSS: Which... which... which... Which one is it?
ROSS: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
RACHEL: What is the matter with us?
JOEY: Well, I know what's the matter with me.
RACHEL: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
JOEY: I don't know.
CHANDLER: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
RACHEL: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
CHANDLER: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
RACHEL: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
JOEY: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
CHANDLER: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
CHANDLER: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
RACHEL: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
JOEY: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
RACHEL: Right, totally.
JOEY: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
RACHEL: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
JOEY: That's a... pla-an.
JOEY: Wow... I did not see this coming.
RACHEL: Hmmm... Me too...
RACHEL: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
JOEY: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
RACHEL: Aah... I bet you're right.
JOEY: So...
RACHEL: Yeah.
JOEY: I love ya.
RACHEL: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
JOEY: Yeah, me too.
JOEY: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
CHANDLER: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
ROSS: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
CHANDLER: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
ROSS: Really? Did you count Mississipily?
ROSS: Dude, you're not tanned.
CHANDLER: No, I just had to get a picture of this.
CHANDLER: I see you later!
CHANDLER: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
RACHEL: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
ROSS: Yeah!
RACHEL: We're having a party.
ROSS: No.
RACHEL: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
CHANDLER: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
ROSS: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
MONICA: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
CHANDLER: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
RACHEL: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
ROSS: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
RACHEL: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
MONICA: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
CHANDLER: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
RACHEL: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
ROSS: Hey guys!
ROSS: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
RACHEL: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
PHOEBE: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
ROSS: Yeah!
PHOEBE: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
ROSS: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
RACHEL: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
ROSS: Ah, and where is Joey?
RACHEL: I said it's still nap time.
ROSS: Hey, there is uncle Joey!
ROSS: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
ROSS: When they see this you'll be 52!
RACHEL: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
PHOEBE: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
PHOEBE: Joey, it's a birthday party.
MONICA: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
RACHEL: Oh, she's still napping
CHANDLER: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
RACHEL: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
MONICA: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
RACHEL: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
MONICA: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: So glad you came!
MONICA: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
CHANDLER: I know, what are we gonna do?
MONICA: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
CHANDLER: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
PHOEBE: Oh!
PHOEBE: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
RACHEL: Oh! Emma might like what?
RACHEL: What did you get her?
PHOEBE: Separate performances.
RACHEL: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
PHOEBE: Sure, yeah!
RACHEL: All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
ROSS: Oh, great!
PHOEBE: Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
RACHEL: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
RACHEL: Oh, ok, which one?
RACHEL: Wow! That was amazing!
ROSS: Thank you so much for that gift!
ROSS: Amazing... amazing.
RACHEL: Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
PHOEBE: That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
RACHEL: Is that it?
PHOEBE: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . “Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.
RACHEL: Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
ROSS: Sure.
RACHEL: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.
MONICA: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
RACHEL: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
MONICA: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
RACHEL: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
ROSS: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
RACHEL: Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
RACHEL: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
ROSS: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
ROSS: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
RACHEL: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
RACHEL: Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
CHANDLER: To be fair this one does have nuts.
ROSS: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
MONICA: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
ROSS: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
CHANDLER: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
MONICA: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
CHANDLER: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
MONICA: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
PHOEBE: And you know, I have a massage client soon.
ROSS: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
MONICA: Alright, 5 more minutes.
ROSS: Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
CHANDLER: Was that Emma? Is she up?
ROSS: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
PHOEBE: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
MONICA: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
ROSS: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
CHANDLER: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
ROSS: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
CHANDLER: To the bathroom!
PHOEBE: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
CHANDLER: What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
PHOEBE: No, it did not.
PHOEBE: Joey? How could you just let them leave?
MONICA: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
CHANDLER: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
PHOEBE: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
MONICA: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
PHOEBE: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
MONICA: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
MONICA: Ok, ten.
PHOEBE: No, lets just draw straws.
CHANDLER: I'm begging you stop.
MONICA: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
PHOEBE: Yeah!! Let's do that!
CHANDLER: That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
MONICA: Everybody get your toys!
PHOEBE: Ok! I want the dolphin!
CHANDLER: Thats a bear.
PHOEBE: I'm too excited!
MONICA: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
CHANDLER: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
PHOEBE: Go! Go!
JOEY: Come on robot!
MONICA: What are you barking at?
MONICA: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
CHANDLER: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
JOEY: Way to go robot!
PHOEBE: Good job Alan!
JOEY: Hey, good race you guys.
PHOEBE: Yeah, see you later!
MONICA: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
CHANDLER: They left.
ROSS: RACHEL!
RACHEL: OOH! God! Sorry!
ROSS: I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
RACHEL: Emma's awake.
ROSS: Yeah?
RACHEL: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
ROSS: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
RACHEL: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
ROSS: Rach, she's not going to remember this.
RACHEL: I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
ROSS: Hey!
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: It's not bad.
RACHEL: Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
ROSS: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
RACHEL: Well, I'm very impressed.
ROSS: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
CHANDLER: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
MONICA: Game?
CHANDLER: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
CHANDLER: Ooh! That's my girl!
MONICA: That's how old you are.
CHANDLER: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
MONICA: Ooh, I want one...
CHANDLER: Me too...
CHANDLER: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
MONICA: ...and head to Canada!
CHANDLER: I was kidding.
MONICA: I wasn't. Let's get going!
PHOEBE: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
CHANDLER: No, not yet.
PHOEBE: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
MONICA: What about your massage client?
PHOEBE: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
JOEY: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
JOEY: I've been here the whole time!
ROSS: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
RACHEL: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
CHANDLER: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
RACHEL: What?
CHANDLER: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
RACHEL: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
ROSS: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
RACHEL: NO, no science camp!
ROSS: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
RACHEL: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
MONICA: Thanks!
ROSS: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
CHANDLER: Let's do it, come on!
ROSS: What's wrong? Are you okay?
RACHEL: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
PHOEBE: Hey, you made it into a bunny.
ROSS: Okay, you ready?
RACHEL: Yeah.
ROSS: A-a-and... record.
RACHEL: Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
JOEY: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
RACHEL: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
JOEY: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
MONICA: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
RACHEL: Of course, I'd be honored!
CHANDLER: Thanks!
MONICA: Thank you!
JOEY: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
CHANDLER: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
MONICA: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
JOEY: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
MONICA: Clearly we were wrong.
JOEY: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
MONICA: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
JOEY: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
CHANDLER: So excited about your letter!
PHOEBE: Hey!
JOEY: Hey!
MONICA: Wow! Don't you look nice?!
PHOEBE: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
RACHEL: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
PHOEBE: YEAH!
CHANDLER: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
PHOEBE: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
JOEY: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
PHOEBE: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
MONICA: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
CHANDLER: That's where people make number two!!
ROSS: Hey...
ROSS: Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
ROSS: B, B, B, B, B!
ROSS: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
ROSS: Damnit!
ROSS: Hi Amy!
ROSS: Still sharp as a tack!
ROSS: Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
ROSS: Yes, yes, you did.
ROSS: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
RACHEL: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
JOEY: That's right, yeah.
JOEY: Always nice to meet a fan!
RACHEL: So now, what are you doing here?
RACHEL: Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
ROSS: Ehm... Her name is Emma.
ROSS: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
ROSS: Oh my God!
JOEY: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
ROSS: What... what you working on?
JOEY: Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
ROSS: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
JOEY: What did I just say?
ROSS: Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
JOEY: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
RACHEL: Oh, I know, isn't she?
RACHEL: All right. What's your news, Amy?
RACHEL: What? Oh my God! To who?
RACHEL: A-And??
RACHEL: No, what's he like?
RACHEL: Yeah.
RACHEL: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
RACHEL: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
RACHEL: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
RACHEL: Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
RACHEL: Ok.
RACHEL: Ok, let’s keep talking.
PHOEBE: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! . Can’t believe it's been a whole year!
PHOEBE: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
PHOEBE: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
PHOEBE: Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
PHOEBE: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
JOEY: Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
CHANDLER: I don’t... uh... understand.
JOEY: Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
MONICA: It doesn’t make any sense.
JOEY: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
CHANDLER: On every word?
JOEY: Yep!
MONICA: Alright, what was this sentence originally?
JOEY: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
CHANDLER: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
JOEY: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
MONICA: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
JOEY: Why not?
MONICA: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
CHANDLER: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
RACHEL: Amy, hi!
RACHEL: Oh, good for you!
RACHEL: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
RACHEL: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
JOEY: Ah, look who’s back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
JOEY: What?
JOEY: You slept out here?
RACHEL: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’
JOEY: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.
RACHEL: Joey, I can’t do that!
JOEY: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
RACHEL: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
JOEY: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
RACHEL: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
JOEY: Yeah, Monica made us!
RACHEL: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.
JOEY: Yeaah.
RACHEL: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.
RACHEL: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
JOEY: I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
PHOEBE: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
CHANDLER: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
MONICA: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
ROSS: Seriously?
CHANDLER: Word!
PHOEBE: Well, mine was worse than that.
RACHEL: Well, what happened?
PHOEBE: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
RACHEL: Oh, that is so tacky.
PHOEBE: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
MONICA: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
RACHEL: Phoebe, that’s huge!
ROSS: Well, do you wanna marry him?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
CHANDLER: She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
MONICA: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
MONICA: I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
CHANDLER: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
MONICA: Thank you.
PHOEBE: Well, do you think I should propose?
RACHEL: I think it could be kind of great!
ROSS: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
PHOEBE: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
MONICA: How about at a game, on the big screen?
RACHEL: Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
MONICA: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
PHOEBE: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
CHANDLER: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
RACHEL: Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
RACHEL: Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
ROSS: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
RACHEL: Menstrual cramps.
ROSS: I don't think that's what this is.
RACHEL: Can any of you watch Emma?
MONICA: No, sorry sweety..
PHOEBE: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
RACHEL: Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
RACHEL: Well, actually...
ROSS: Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
RACHEL: Yeah.
ROSS: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
RACHEL: Why not?
ROSS: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
RACHEL: Wha... the next one?
ROSS: Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
RACHEL: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
ROSS: I... I don't know..
RACHEL: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
RACHEL: Absolutely.
CHANDLER: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
JOEY: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
MONICA: You dropped it off?
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
JOEY: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
MONICA: You hand-wrote it?
JOEY: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
CHANDLER: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
MONICA: Okay good.
CHANDLER: Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
MONICA: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
CHANDLER: They loved it.
MONICA: What?
CHANDLER: They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
MONICA: They thought Joey was a child?
CHANDLER: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
MONICA: Hey, what did you guys do today?
CHANDLER: That sounds like fun.
RACHEL: Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
RACHEL: Yeah!
RACHEL: You pierced her ears!?
CHANDLER: I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
RACHEL: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
RACHEL: Ugh.
ROSS: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
RACHEL: Nah, I don't really want her to see.
ROSS: Why not?
MONICA: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
CHANDLER: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
ROSS: Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: Nothing.
ROSS: Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
RACHEL: Oh, they're real!
ROSS: Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
RACHEL: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
MONICA: I'm a cool, fun aunt!
CHANDLER: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
RACHEL: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
RACHEL: Oh yeah? Since when?
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: That's not a thing!
RACHEL: Babies don't care if they're slim.
ROSS: Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
ROSS: No more falafel for you!
PHOEBE: Uhuh, uhuh...
PHOEBE: I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
PHOEBE: Well, I think you should wait.
PHOEBE: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
PHOEBE: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
PHOEBE: That's not very enlightened!
PHOEBE: Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
JOEY: Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
RACHEL: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
JOEY: Whoo-hoo!
RACHEL: You put holes in my baby's ears!
RACHEL: I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
RACHEL: Excuse me?
RACHEL: Joey, where are those bags?
JOEY: She has a lot of crap!
RACHEL: Seriously?
RACHEL: Hips or thighs?
RACHEL: Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
RACHEL: Oh, I can give you that.
RACHEL: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
RACHEL: Did you just say Emma?
PHOEBE: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
PHOEBE: I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
PHOEBE: It's in the cake, isn't it?
PHOEBE: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
PHOEBE: Oh my God!
PHOEBE: Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
PHOEBE: Uh-huh!
PHOEBE: Yes!
PHOEBE: I love you more!
RACHEL: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
RACHEL: That's shocking!
RACHEL: Hi!
ROSS: Pheebs, what's wrong?
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
RACHEL: My God!
ROSS: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
PHOEBE: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
JOEY: Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
PHOEBE: Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
RACHEL: Mmh-mmh!
PHOEBE: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
RACHEL: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
PHOEBE: I would, but you're the last one.
RACHEL: GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
PHOEBE: Oh, my first love!
RACHEL: Oh!
MONICA: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
PHOEBE: Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
CHANDLER: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
RACHEL: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
PHOEBE: Oh yes, they are.
CHANDLER: Hey honey!
JOEY: Hi sweetie!
CHANDLER: Is Monica not here?
JOEY: No.
CHANDLER: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
JOEY: Cool!
CHANDLER: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
JOEY: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
CHANDLER: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
JOEY: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
CHANDLER: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
JOEY: I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
CHANDLER: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
JOEY: I'm cold!
ROSS: Hey!
ROSS: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
ROSS: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
ROSS: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
ROSS: Yeah. Why?
ROSS: Your ex-boyfriend?
ROSS: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
ROSS: Well, if you think it would help.
ROSS: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
ROSS: We'll see how dinner goes.
PHOEBE: Hey!
MONICA: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
PHOEBE: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
MONICA: Oh, right.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
MONICA: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
PHOEBE: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
MONICA: Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
PHOEBE: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
MONICA: Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
PHOEBE: Why, you don't like her?
MONICA: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
PHOEBE: Really? You think?
MONICA: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
PHOEBE: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
MONICA: Damn it, I did not think this through!
CHANDLER: Hey you guys.
RACHEL: Hi!
JOEY: Oh! Any word on casting yet?
CHANDLER: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
JOEY: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
RACHEL: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
CHANDLER: Joe...
JOEY: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
CHANDLER: Fine!
JOEY: Thank you.
CHANDLER: Work, Joe!
JOEY: Damn it!
JOEY: Just pass it to your boss!
CHANDLER: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
RACHEL: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
CHANDLER: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
ROSS: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
ROSS: I'm ok.
ROSS: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
ROSS: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
ROSS: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
ROSS: See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
ROSS: What?
ROSS: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
ROSS: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
ROSS: Are you serious?
ROSS: No!
PHOEBE: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
MONICA: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
PHOEBE: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
MONICA: Wow, what's the bad news!
RACHEL: Who's Gladys?
PHOEBE: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
RACHEL: Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
PHOEBE: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
MONICA: Huh!
RACHEL: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
MONICA: You know, I would give her up, for you.
RACHEL: No, I couldn't let you do that.
MONICA: But I want to.
RACHEL: But I don't want you to.
MONICA: But I insist!
RACHEL: But I insist harder!
PHOEBE: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!
MONICA: No, that landed in your food!
RACHEL: No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
CHANDLER: Hey Joe!
JOEY: What's up?
CHANDLER: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
JOEY: Oh.
CHANDLER: I'm sorry man.
JOEY: But, ehm... you watched the tape?
CHANDLER: Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
JOEY: You didn't watch the tape.
CHANDLER: What!? Of course I did!
JOEY: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
CHANDLER: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
JOEY: Well, you lied again!
CHANDLER: I watched it!
JOEY: Keep going Pinocchio!
CHANDLER: I did!
JOEY: No you didn't!
CHANDLER: I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
RACHEL: Did you watch the tape?
CHANDLER: No!
ROSS: I guess!
ROSS: What? I... I...
ROSS: May 12th?
ROSS: Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
ROSS: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
ROSS: um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
ROSS: Ok. B - O - S ...
ROSS: Oh come on!!
CHANDLER: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
RACHEL: But you are a liar.
CHANDLER: What did I just say?
JOEY: You still here?
CHANDLER: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
JOEY: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
CHANDLER: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
JOEY: You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
RACHEL: Well, this is going well.
JOEY: Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
CHANDLER: He really is a chameleon.
PHOEBE: Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
MONICA: Oh, my!
RACHEL: Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
RACHEL: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
MONICA: I like that poster!
PHOEBE: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
RACHEL: Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
MONICA: Are you still here?
ROSS: No! Stop!
ROSS: Really?
ROSS: I have to break up with Charlie?
ROSS: You're crazy.
ROSS: Crazy!
ROSS: Get out!
RACHEL: O-oh my God!
JOEY: What?
RACHEL: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
JOEY: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
RACHEL: Joey, we're not keeping this!
JOEY: But it's an original Buffay...
RACHEL: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
JOEY: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
RACHEL: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
RACHEL: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
JOEY: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
MONICA: Hey! I sold that to Joey.
RACHEL: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
MONICA: No, too late. You can't give it back!
RACHEL: Yes I can!
MONICA: No you can't. She's yours!
RACHEL: She's yours!
MONICA: SHE'S YOURS!
RACHEL: She's yours!
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: She's mine!
MONICA: She's m-i-i-ne!
RACHEL: She's mine!
MONICA: She's mine!
PHOEBE: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
RACHEL: I want Gladys!
MONICA: She's mine!
RACHEL: She's mine!
MONICA: She's mine!
RACHEL: She's mine!
CHANDLER: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
JOEY: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
CHANDLER: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
MONICA: Oh my God!
RACHEL: Excellent!
JOEY: Now, what do you say?
CHANDLER: Lying is wrong!
JOEY: And?... AND?
CHANDLER: I'm a pretty little girl.
PHOEBE: I knew it!
ROSS: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
ROSS: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
ROSS: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
ROSS: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
ROSS: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
ROSS: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
ROSS: Damnit!
ROSS: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
ROSS: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
ROSS: Too little, too late, Benji!
ROSS: No!
ROSS: What?
ROSS: or...
ROSS: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
ROSS: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
JOEY: Gladys?
RACHEL: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
JOEY: You're mean!
RACHEL: Oh, don't be such a baby!
ROSS: Hey you guys!
PHOEBE: Hey!
ROSS: Hey, what are you doing?
CHANDLER: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
ROSS: Yeah!
CHANDLER: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
CHANDLER: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
ROSS: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
ROSS: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
ROSS: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
CHANDLER: Maybe you do that next time you get married!
ROSS: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
JOEY: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hey!
JOEY: What's going on?
CHANDLER: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
MONICA: We?
CHANDLER: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
JOEY: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
CHANDLER: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
MONICA: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
JOEY: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
CHANDLER: Little people?
JOEY: Celebrity.
MONICA: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
CHANDLER: What...? NO!
MONICA: Chandler?
CHANDLER: I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
MONICA: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
CHANDLER: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
MONICA: It isn't mine!
JOEY: Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
ROSS: Hi!
RACHEL: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
ROSS: Oh, good!
RACHEL: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
ROSS: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
RACHEL: Absolutely.
ROSS: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
RACHEL: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
ROSS: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
RACHEL: Oh my God, what!?
ROSS: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
RACHEL: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
ROSS: Be-caaauuuse...
RACHEL: All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
ROSS: Seriously?
RACHEL: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
ROSS: And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
RACHEL: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
ROSS: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
RACHEL: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
ROSS: Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.
RACHEL: All right!
ROSS: Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
RACHEL: Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
ROSS: Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
MONICA: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
CHANDLER: Ok, ok, here we go.
MONICA: Ok.
CHANDLER: Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
MONICA: We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
MONICA: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
MONICA: That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
MONICA: That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
MONICA: Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
MONICA: Yay!
CHANDLER: But you already gave all your money to charity!
CHANDLER: I don’t think you can do that!
MONICA: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
CHANDLER: That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
RACHEL: Ok, careful.
ROSS: Ok.
RACHEL: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
ROSS: Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
RACHEL: I know but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
ROSS: I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
RACHEL: Ok.
RACHEL: Ok.
ROSS: Here we go!
RACHEL: Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
ROSS: See, I told you!
RACHEL: Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
ROSS: Oh, absolutely!
RACHEL: Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.
ROSS: Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
MONICA: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
MONICA: Would you like something to drink?
MONICA: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
CHANDLER: Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
MONICA: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
MONICA: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
CHANDLER: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
CHANDLER: What?
MONICA: Really? What is it?
MONICA: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
CHANDLER: Of course it was!
CHANDLER: RAT BASTARD!
JOEY: Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
CHANDLER: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
RACHEL: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
ROSS: SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
RACHEL: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
ROSS: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
RACHEL: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
ROSS: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
RACHEL: I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
ROSS: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
RACHEL: Alright fine. I'll do it.
ROSS: Good.
RACHEL: If you hold a spider.
ROSS: WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
RACHEL: IF you hold a spider.
ROSS: I know.
JOEY: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
CHANDLER: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
CHANDLER: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
JOEY: Guys!?
MONICA: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
JOEY: What's going on?
CHANDLER: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
JOEY: Everything doesn't sound fine!
CHANDLER: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
CHANDLER: You can't make this stuff up!
MONICA: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
MONICA: Why don't I show you the baby's room?
CHANDLER: What the hell are you doing?
JOEY: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
CHANDLER: Well, we're not.
JOEY: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
CHANDLER: We don't have a code word.
JOEY: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
MONICA: So that was the baby's room.
MONICA: What room should we see next?
CHANDLER: Any room that isn't behind this couch!
MONICA: Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! .
JOEY: I did not care for that!
CHANDLER: You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
JOEY: Ok, ok!
CHANDLER: Ok!
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: I forgot my bat.
CHANDLER: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
JOEY: Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
CHANDLER: I can explain... Joey...
JOEY: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
JOEY: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
JOEY: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
JOEY: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
JOEY: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
JOEY: NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...
CHANDLER: Oh, that's really ok.
MONICA: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
JOEY: LAURA!
MONICA: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
CHANDLER: Wrong number?
MONICA: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
CHANDLER: That's great!
MONICA: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
CHANDLER: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
RACHEL: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
ROSS: Ok...
RACHEL: Ok...
ROSS: This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
RACHEL: Ok... O-k...
RACHEL: Ok...
RACHEL: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
ROSS: See?
RACHEL: A-alright! I can do this.
ROSS: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
RACHEL: That's because he's on your neck.
ROSS: Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
RACHEL: ROSS!
MONICA: Hey guys!
RACHEL: Hi!
PHOEBE: Hey!
MONICA: We need to talk to you about something.
CHANDLER: Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
PHOEBE: Hey!
ROSS: Are you kidding?
CHANDLER: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
ROSS: That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
CHANDLER: No, no! We made this decision together.
ROSS: She's putting words in your mouth!
JOEY: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
RACHEL: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
MONICA: No, it's not!
RACHEL: It's not? When was she born?
PHOEBE: Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
MONICA: Thank you, Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
MONICA: What? You are way off, lady!
PHOEBE: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
MONICA: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
CHANDLER: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
MONICA: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
CHANDLER: We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
MONICA: You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
PHOEBE: You're not making the pies yourself?
MONICA: No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
RACHEL: Did you at least win the contest?
MONICA: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
RACHEL: Can't wait!
MONICA: This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
PHOEBE: Hey Rach.
RACHEL: Yeah.
PHOEBE: What's Emma doing today?
RACHEL: Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
PHOEBE: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
RACHEL: Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
PHOEBE: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
RACHEL: Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
PHOEBE: Oh... okay.
RACHEL: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
RACHEL: And a thousand dollars.
RACHEL: ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
PHOEBE: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
RACHEL: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
PHOEBE: Well, I was thinking...
RACHEL: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
PHOEBE: Yeah!
MONICA: Did someone drop the baton again?
CHANDLER: Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
MONICA: I don't get older. I just get better!
CHANDLER: You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
MONICA: You don't know that.
CHANDLER: Somebody is gonna pick us.
MONICA: Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
CHANDLER: I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
MONICA: Name one of his books.
CHANDLER: "The Firm"?
MONICA: Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
CHANDLER: You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
MONICA: Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
CHANDLER: I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
MONICA: Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
CHANDLER: Tell me more.
MONICA: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
CHANDLER: You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
ROSS: Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
JOEY: Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
ROSS: Dude, I wanted him to guess.
JOEY: Oh.
CHANDLER: Oh my God!
JOEY: Yeah, they're great seats too!
ROSS: Guess where they are?
JOEY: Center ice.
ROSS: Did I do something to you?
CHANDLER: Hmm, the game's at one.
ROSS: So?
CHANDLER: Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
JOEY: So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
CHANDLER: You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
JOEY: Dude, two times that happened!
CHANDLER: Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
ROSS: He's right, man.
JOEY: Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
CHANDLER: Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
JOEY: That's some gentle comedy, dude.
ROSS: We're still going at the game, right?
JOEY: Yeah!
ROSS: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Hey.
RACHEL: Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
PHOEBE: We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
RACHEL: Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
PHOEBE: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
RACHEL: Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
PHOEBE: But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
RACHEL: Phoebe, you have to calm down.
PHOEBE: Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
RACHEL: Really?
PHOEBE: Yeah!
RACHEL: You heard them say that?
PHOEBE: Yeah!
RACHEL: All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
PHOEBE: Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
RACHEL: No, what?
PHOEBE: Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
RACHEL: No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
PHOEBE: Why not!
RACHEL: Because I already did!
JOEY: Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
ROSS: Oh! What a game, huh?
JOEY: I know, yeah.
ROSS: I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
JOEY: Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
ROSS: Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
JOEY: Ohhhh! These seats are great!
ROSS: I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
JOEY: Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
ROSS: Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
JOEY: I don't know...
ROSS: One more fight!
JOEY: Okay.
ROSS: Okay.
MONICA: Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
CHANDLER: I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
JOEY: How late are we?
ROSS: Forty-five minutes.
JOEY: Wow
ROSS: Here!
JOEY: Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
ROSS: You may want to lose the foam finger!
JOEY: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
ROSS: Hey!
PHOEBE: Oh!
JOEY: You are not at Thanksgiving?
RACHEL: No...
PHOEBE: No, we're late!
RACHEL: What are you doing here!
ROSS: We're late too!
JOEY: We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
PHOEBE: Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
ROSS: So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
JOEY: Yeah, where were you!
ROSS: Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
PHOEBE: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
RACHEL: And I won!
ROSS: You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
RACHEL: Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
ROSS: Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
RACHEL: Yeah. That's me!
ROSS: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
PHOEBE: And it looks like she put makeup on her!
JOEY: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
ROSS: I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
RACHEL: She won a thousand dollars!
ROSS: So this is an annual thing?
JOEY: Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
PHOEBE: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
ROSS: Yeah. What are we gonna do?
RACHEL: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
JOEY: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
PHOEBE: Alright, what are we gonna say?
ROSS: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
PHOEBE: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
JOEY: No. Here
ROSS: HEY!
MONICA: Do you hear something?
CHANDLER: They're out there!
MONICA: Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
CHANDLER: Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
MONICA: Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
CHANDLER: Ross' shirt is torn.
MONICA: Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
RACHEL: Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
ROSS: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
PHOEBE: We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
ROSS: That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
RACHEL: You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
ROSS: We know you're out there.
JOEY: Who do you think its from?
RACHEL: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
ROSS: Well, let's just go in there and face them.
PHOEBE: Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
JOEY: I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
RACHEL: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .
JOEY: Ah-haah! I win!!
ROSS: What is that?
JOEY: That's fire. Beats everything.
PHOEBE: Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .
JOEY: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
RACHEL: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
PHOEBE: It's locked.
ROSS: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
RACHEL: Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
MONICA: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
CHANDLER: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
MONICA: Nothing. It's fine.
CHANDLER: Oh thank God!
ROSS: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
CHANDLER: That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
ROSS: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
RACHEL: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
JOEY: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
MONICA: That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
ROSS: How are we gonna decide who gets this?
JOEY: WATER BALLOON!
PHOEBE: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
RACHEL: Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah!
MONICA: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
CHANDLER: Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
RACHEL: Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
ROSS: That's worse than no food.
CHANDLER: HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
MONICA: Stinky?!
CHANDLER: Please let me stay on this side of the door.
RACHEL: Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
PHOEBE: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
RACHEL: You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
JOEY: Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
ROSS: I don't know...
JOEY: I'm telling ya... I can do it.
ROSS: Yeah, he can do it!
RACHEL: Oh!
JOEY: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
CHANDLER: The cranberries...?
MONICA: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
JOEY: Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
CHANDLER: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
JOEY: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
ROSS: I feel terrible.
JOEY: Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
CHANDLER: The floating heads do make a good point.
MONICA: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
RACHEL: So bad.
PHOEBE: So bad.
MONICA: Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
RACHEL: Dessert?
MONICA: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
PHOEBE: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
MONICA: Grand Supreme Little Darling?
RACHEL: Congratulatioooons!
MONICA: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
ROSS: Really girls, not cool.
CHANDLER: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
JOEY: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
ROSS: It's a day to be thankful.
JOEY: Don't make me come up there!
MONICA: It's too late for apologies.
JOEY: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
CHANDLER: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
RACHEL: Ewww, is that what that is?
JOEY: Sorry!
PHOEBE: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
RACHEL: Yeah! I'll cook!
ROSS: Yeah! Let's go out.
RACHEL: Hey!
JOEY: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
MONICA: The three of us?
JOEY: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
JOEY: Ha!
JOEY: Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
MONICA: Joey, that is not gonna work.
JOEY: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
PHOEBE: I'll pull you through.
ROSS: Okay.
JOEY: aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
CHANDLER: A little late for that.
JOEY: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
MONICA: Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
CHANDLER: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
MONICA: Bring it.
JOEY: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
MONICA: Here you go!
JOEY: Oh, that smells good!
JOEY: Okay.
MONICA: Okay, try it.
JOEY: It isn't working.
MONICA: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
JOEY: Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
CHANDLER: Can you ever feel your ears?
JOEY: Interesting...
MONICA: Chandler, where are your tools?
CHANDLER: Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
MONICA: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
RACHEL: I lent them to Ross.
ROSS: I gave them to Joey.
JOEY: I left them at the park.
MONICA: Oh!
ROSS: I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
PHOEBE: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
ROSS: Nice!
MONICA: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
JOEY: It's really starting to hurt.
CHANDLER: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
PHOEBE: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
JOEY: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
CHANDLER: Come on guys, PUSH!
JOEY: Yeah! Come on!
CHANDLER: My cranberries!
JOEY: Man, I've got food all over me.
CHANDLER: Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
CHANDLER: Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
MONICA: I don't care.
CHANDLER: What's going on?
MONICA: That was the adoption agency...
CHANDLER: And?
MONICA: WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
CHANDLER: Are you serious?
MONICA: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
RACHEL: I'm so happy for you!
MONICA: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!
CHANDLER: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
PHOEBE: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
MONICA: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
JOEY: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
CHANDLER: And so incorrect!
MONICA: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
ROSS: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
CHANDLER: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
MONICA: And a lot could still get in our way.
CHANDLER: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
PHOEBE: What are you gonna name the baby?
CHANDLER: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
JOEY: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
MONICA: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
CHANDLER: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
MONICA: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
CHANDLER: Yes, but...
MONICA: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
CHANDLER: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
RACHEL: Hey, who's Phoebe with?
JOEY: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey!
JOEY: So... who's your friend?
PHOEBE: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
JOEY: OW, why, why, why?
PHOEBE: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
JOEY: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
PHOEBE: Mandy.
JOEY: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
PHOEBE: No.
JOEY: I know why I don't remember her, huh?
RACHEL: Do you think I'm someone else?
JOEY: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
RACHEL: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
JOEY: Growth!
PHOEBE: Fine, I'll give you her number.
JOEY: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
PHOEBE: SARAH!
JOEY: Saraaah.
ROSS: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi!
ROSS: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
RACHEL: Oh!
ROSS: How does this look?
RACHEL: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
ROSS: C'mon! This looks good!
RACHEL: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
ROSS: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
PHOEBE: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
ROSS: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
JOEY: I can see why, nice shirt!
ROSS: You're wearing the same shirt.
JOEY: Stupid Gap on every corner!
MONICA: Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
CHANDLER: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
MONICA: Uh, we're gonna be great.
CHANDLER: You're gonna be great.
MONICA: Well... obviously!
MONICA: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
CHANDLER: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
CHANDLER: Ok.
CHANDLER: That's what our friends call us.
MONICA: I don't know about that.
CHANDLER: I don't think that's exactly...
MONICA: Let her finish, doctor.
JOEY: Hey.
PHOEBE: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
JOEY: Well...
PHOEBE: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
JOEY: Nope.
PHOEBE: What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
JOEY: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
PHOEBE: That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
JOEY: Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
PHOEBE: What?
JOEY: ALL FOOD!
PHOEBE: I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
JOEY: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
PHOEBE: Oh
RACHEL: Hi
PHOEBE: Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
RACHEL: what?
PHOEBE: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
RACHEL: Oh! Oh, no!
PHOEBE: What? You know about the plate thing?
RACHEL: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
PHOEBE: You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
RACHEL: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
JOEY: JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
PHOEBE: Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
JOEY: I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
ROSS: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
RACHEL: Ah, this place is great!
PHOEBE: Wow!
ROSS: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
RACHEL: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
ROSS: Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
RACHEL: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
ROSS: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
ROSS: Wow!
PHOEBE: Yeah!
ROSS: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
PHOEBE: What? They will be!
ROSS: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
RACHEL: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
ROSS: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
RACHEL: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
ROSS: Really?
RACHEL: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
ROSS: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
RACHEL: Why do men keep talking to me like this?
CHANDLER: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
MONICA: Amen.
CHANDLER: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
MONICA: Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
MONICA: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
CHANDLER: Yeah, wow.
MONICA: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
CHANDLER: No-ot for me it doesn’t.
CHANDLER: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
CHANDLER: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
MONICA: We don’t?
MONICA: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I did.
MONICA: Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
RACHEL: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
PHOEBE: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
RACHEL: Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
PHOEBE: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
ROSS: So? What do you think?
JOEY: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
ROSS: Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
JOEY: Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
ROSS: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
JOEY: Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
ROSS: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
CHANDLER: We are NOT signing those papers.
MONICA: Why not?
CHANDLER: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
MONICA: God works in mysterious ways.
CHANDLER: You have gotta stop!
MONICA: But she liked us.
CHANDLER: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
MONICA: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
CHANDLER: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
MONICA: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
CHANDLER: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
MONICA: Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
CHANDLER: I know..
MONICA: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
CHANDLER: oh, honey..
MONICA: Please.. please, we are so close.
CHANDLER: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
MONICA: Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
CHANDLER: You're Jewish.
MONICA: Technicality!
JOEY: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
JOEY: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
JOEY: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
JOEY: How about those fries though, huh?
JOEY: You are beautiful, you know that?
JOEY: Oh okay..
JOEY: NOW look what you did!!
JOEY: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
JOEY: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
JOEY: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do .
ROSS: Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
ROSS: Here So this was fun!
JOEY: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
JOEY: Well, stuffed clams.
JOEY: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
JOEY: So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
JOEY: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
JOEY: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
JOEY: Sure I do. Coule?
JOEY: Really?
JOEY: Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
JOEY: Stop staring at me!
JOEY: Why, just a tiny little...
JOEY: Oh-oh!
JOEY: I'm not even sorry.
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: I-Is... Is that a picture?
MONICA: Look, doctor!
CHANDLER: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
CHANDLER: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
CHANDLER: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
MONICA: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
MONICA: Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
MONICA: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
MONICA: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
CHANDLER: Erica wait!
CHANDLER: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
CHANDLER: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
CHANDLER: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
CHANDLER: You still want that baby?
MONICA: God bless you Chandler Bing!
ROSS: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
JOEY: So, why are you still wearing it?
ROSS: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
JOEY: Ooh... Not so good.
ROSS: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
JOEY: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
JOEY: JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
RACHEL: My God, get a room!
MONICA: I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
PHOEBE: If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
MONICA: Sex!
CHANDLER: Seriously, answer faster!
MONICA: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
CHANDLER: It's like a giant hug.
PHOEBE: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
ROSS: Food.
PHOEBE: Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
ROSS: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
RACHEL: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
JOEY: Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
RACHEL: No, you gotta pick one!
JOEY: Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
RACHEL: You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
PHOEBE: Oh, how cute!
RACHEL: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
RACHEL: Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
PHOEBE: Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
RACHEL: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
PHOEBE: OH! He's having an affair.
RACHEL: He's not having an affair!
PHOEBE: You know, I'm always right about these things.
RACHEL: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
PHOEBE: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
RACHEL: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
CHANDLER: Hello.
PHOEBE: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
CHANDLER: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
PHOEBE: Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
CHANDLER: Those are all really old!
PHOEBE: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
RACHEL: "Dude, Where's My Car?"
PHOEBE: What?
RACHEL: They're in a caaar...
PHOEBE: Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
RACHEL: Geez!
PHOEBE: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
PHOEBE: I got them!
CHANDLER: Hi!
MONICA: Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
CHANDLER: I was in the car with Nancy all day.
MONICA: Nancy doesn’t smoke!
CHANDLER: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
MONICA: So? What do you think of the house?
CHANDLER: It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
MONICA: Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
CHANDLER: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
MONICA: Don’t you love the huge yard?
CHANDLER: And the fireplace in the bedroom.
MONICA: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
CHANDLER: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
MONICA: So? Do you think we should get it?
CHANDLER: I don’t know. What do you think?
MONICA: I think we should.
CHANDLER: I do too.
MONICA: This is huge!
CHANDLER: I know.
MONICA: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
CHANDLER: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
MONICA: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
CHANDLER: We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
MONICA: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
CHANDLER: I know. Gooooood luck with it.
ROSS: I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
RACHEL: I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
JOEY: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
ROSS: I know, and with the baby coming?
PHOEBE: So, should we tell her?
ROSS: I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
PHOEBE: Why? Who’d you seen him with?
ROSS: No one, I’m just saying if...
PHOEBE: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
ROSS: I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
PHOEBE: All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
ROSS: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...
RACHEL: Oh, look at her, so happy!
MONICA: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
JOEY: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
MONICA: No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
PHOEBE: Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
ROSS: We think Chandler might be having an affair.
MONICA: What?
RACHEL: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
PHOEBE: They went in together. So sorry.
MONICA: Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
PHOEBE: What?
JOEY: Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
MONICA: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
CHANDLER: Hey!
JOEY: You son of a bitch!
CHANDLER: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
MONICA: Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
RACHEL: Who's Nancy?
ROSS: What's going on?
MONICA: Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
CHANDLER: Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
JOEY: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
PHOEBE: Why do you have a realtor?
MONICA: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
JOEY: What?
RACHEL: Are you serious?
MONICA: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
PHOEBE: So you're gonna move?
ROSS: Oh my God.
JOEY: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
RACHEL: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
MONICA: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
CHANDLER: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
ROSS: So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
PHOEBE: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
ROSS: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
JOEY: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
ROSS: It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
CHANDLER: Actually, we already found a house we love.
ROSS: What?
MONICA: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
CHANDLER: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
ROSS: You put an offer on a house?
MONICA: It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
PHOEBE: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
CHANDLER: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
JOEY: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
CHANDLER: You know that's not the reason Joe.
MONICA: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
RACHEL: Yeah it is.
JOEY: What the hell are you doin'?
RACHEL: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
PHOEBE: Yeah, but so is this.
ROSS: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
RACHEL: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
ROSS: You can see where he'd have trouble.
RACHEL: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
MONICA: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
ROSS: That money is mine, Green!
RACHEL: You're fly is open, Geller!
PHOEBE: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
CHANDLER: Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
PHOEBE: Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
RACHEL: Ow, that had to hurt!
PHOEBE: Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
MONICA: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
RACHEL: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
MONICA: Every year.
JOEY: It's stuck!!!
PHOEBE: Easy. Step. How did it get on?
JOEY: I put it on to scare Chandler!
PHOEBE: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
JOEY: It smells really bad in here.
PHOEBE: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
MONICA: Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
JOEY: It's Joey.
MONICA: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
RACHEL: Oooohh that’s interesting.
CHANDLER: If you win, we give up the birds.
JOEY: Dah!!
CHANDLER: But if we win, we get your apartment.
JOEY: Oooooh!
MONICA: Deal!
ROSS: What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
JOEY: Big fat goalie.
ROSS: Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
CHANDLER: Dangerous Liaisons.
ROSS: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
JOEY: Weekend at Bernie’s.
ROSS: Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
JOEY: Everyday use.
CHANDLER: Fancy.
JOEY: Guest.
CHANDLER: Fancy guest.
ROSS: Two seconds...
JOEY: Uhh, 11!
ROSS: 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
ROSS: Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
RACHEL: 14?
ROSS: No, 19.
CHANDLER: Thanks man.
ROSS: Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
MONICA: Maurice.
ROSS: Correct, his profession was?
RACHEL: Space cowboy!
ROSS: Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
RACHEL: Ow...Oh Gosh!
ROSS: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
MONICA: It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
RACHEL: Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
MONICA: That’s not even a word!
MONICA: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
RACHEL: Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
JOEY: Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
RACHEL: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
MONICA: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
RACHEL: Well it stupid, unfair question!
ROSS: Don’t blame the questions!
CHANDLER: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
ROSS: Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
CHANDLER: Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
MONICA: Hey Ross. What's up bro?
ROSS: What the hell are doing?!!
RACHEL: Hey, what's-what's going on?!
CHANDLER: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
JOEY: Dude! He's right there!
ROSS: I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
CHANDLER: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
MONICA: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
ROSS: My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
MONICA: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
RACHEL: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
PHOEBE: Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
PHOEBE: You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
RACHEL: Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
MONICA: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
PHOEBE: What else?
MONICA: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
RACHEL: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
PHOEBE: That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
MONICA: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
RACHEL: Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
MONICA: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: She really left.
CHANDLER: I know.
MONICA: Thank you.
CHANDLER: No problem roomie.
MONICA: Can I ask you a question?
CHANDLER: Sure!
MONICA: What the hell is that dog doing here?!
CHANDLER: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
ROSS: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
RACHEL: And a crappy New Year.
CHANDLER: Here, here!
RACHEL: You can't move. You just... you just can't.
JOEY: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
PHOEBE: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
ROSS: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
RACHEL: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
CHANDLER: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
MONICA: And?
CHANDLER: Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
MONICA: We can't afford that.
CHANDLER: I know.
MONICA: Well, there you go.
JOEY: I'm really sorry you guys.
ROSS: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
RACHEL: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
PHOEBE: You're gonna be okay?
MONICA: Yeah, we'll be okay.
ROSS: Love you guys.
JOEY: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
CHANDLER: That's okay, we understand.
JOEY: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
MONICA: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
CHANDLER: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
MONICA: What?
CHANDLER: We got the house.
MONICA: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
MONICA: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
CHANDLER: We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
MONICA: And a baby...
CHANDLER: We're growing up.
MONICA: We sure are.
CHANDLER: So who's gonna tell them?
MONICA: Not it!
CHANDLER: Not it! Damn it!
MONICA: Rachel, this is yours.
RACHEL: Aah! Why? What are these for?
CHANDLER: You'll see.
MONICA: All right, everybody open them!
RACHEL: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
PHOEBE: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
MONICA: I know.
ROSS: I love this.
JOEY: A meatball Sub? Thanks!
ROSS: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
CHANDLER: Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
MONICA: Enjoy!
JOEY: Hey guys!
MONICA: Hey, let me tell them!
JOEY: Sure.
MONICA: Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
PHOEBE: Great!
ROSS: Really? Which one?
MONICA: Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
ROSS: Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
MONICA: Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
ROSS: Except for "Match game"...
MONICA: Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
CHANDLER: What did I marry into?
JOEY: Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
MONICA: Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
PHOEBE: Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
ROSS: Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
JOEY: Seriously?
ROSS: Yeah-uh!
MONICA: Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
CHANDLER: You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
MONICA: Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
RACHEL: Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
MONICA: "I'm a little bit country"...
ROSS: "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
CHANDLER: I'm leaving you.
ROSS: So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
CHANDLER: Who?
ROSS: He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
CHANDLER: Did I go to this school?
ROSS: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
CHANDLER: Sure, nice.
ROSS: Dude. You're married to my sister.
CHANDLER: You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
ROSS: Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
CHANDLER: Are you asking permission to break the pact?
ROSS: Yes please.
ROSS: Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
CHANDLER: Awesome, the name really stands out.
ROSS: Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
CHANDLER: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
CHANDLER: Hey!
ROSS: Hey, Missy...
CHANDLER: You know, our band is playing on Friday.
ROSS: Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
CHANDLER: Fresh!
ROSS: Boss!
CHANDLER: Mint!
ROSS: She's gone.
CHANDLER: I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
ROSS: Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
CHANDLER: I said it first, bro.
ROSS: Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
CHANDLER: Look, if you did...
ROSS: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
CHANDLER: Totally. I had sex in High school...
ROSS: Me too. I'm good at it.
CHANDLER: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
ROSS: You got it.
CHANDLER: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
ROSS: Those are the pacts!
CHANDLER: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
ROSS: Oh, oh... maybe not you!
CHANDLER: Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
ROSS: Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
CHANDLER: Your hands are shaking.
ROSS: I know, and I can't stop sweating.
JOEY: I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! Only better looking and richer.
JOEY: Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
JOEY: Noo, more like a notebook... Damn it! Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
JOEY: Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. OOOH!
PHOEBE: Thank you so much for this.
RACHEL: Oh, d'you like it?
PHOEBE: Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
RACHEL: What?
PHOEBE: You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
RACHEL: Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
PHOEBE: Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
RACHEL: Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
PHOEBE: Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
RACHEL: Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
JOEY: Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
JOEY: A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
JOEY: Paper, snow, a ghost!
JOEY: A rock, a dog, the earth.
JOEY: Salami, anchovies, jam!
JOEY: Paper, snow, a ghost!
JOEY: Chickens?
JOEY: Oh!
JOEY: Ketchup!
JOEY: Relish!
JOEY: Oh.
JOEY: Yeah...
JOEY: Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
JOEY: Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
JOEY: Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
ROSS: So, Saturday night!
ROSS: Great!
ROSS: Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
ROSS: It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
ROSS: That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
ROSS: Yeah, why?
ROSS: You did?
ROSS: AND ON MY TURF?
MONICA: Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
RACHEL: Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
MONICA: Who is it?
RACHEL: Uh! The police!
PHOEBE: Oh!
MONICA: What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
MONICA: Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
MONICA: ...If-you-say-so.
PHOEBE: Oh, God!
PHOEBE: Rachel?
RACHEL: Yeah?
PHOEBE: Are you kidding?
RACHEL: All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
PHOEBE: How old is your phonebook?
MONICA: Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
PHOEBE: Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
MONICA: Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
PHOEBE: This is how I look when I'm turned on!
PHOEBE: Shocking!
PHOEBE: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
RACHEL: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
PHOEBE: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
PHOEBE: I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
MONICA: Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
JOEY: My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
JOEY: Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
JOEY: Oh, then pass.
ROSS: You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
CHANDLER: Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
ROSS: You broke the pact!
CHANDLER: Ross, that was 16 years ago!
ROSS: That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
CHANDLER: I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
ROSS: I didn't.
CHANDLER: Oh really?
ROSS: No.
CHANDLER: Oh really!?
ROSS: NO!
CHANDLER: ADRIENNE TURNER!!
ROSS: I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
CHANDLER: Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
ROSS: I don't know what... you're talking about.
CHANDLER: Really?
MONICA: I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
RACHEL: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
MONICA: Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
RACHEL: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
MONICA: Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
RACHEL: It... You can so totally tell.
MONICA: I KNOW!
RACHEL: Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
CHANDLER: Aren't you...?
RACHEL: Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
CHANDLER: Right. So how're you doing?
RACHEL: Bitchin'
CHANDLER: Hi Monica.
MONICA: Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
CHANDLER: O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
MONICA: Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
RACHEL: Oh.
MONICA: Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
ROSS: Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
ROSS: Cool!
ROSS: I didn't know you knew about that.
CHANDLER: Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
ROSS: Man... I... I'm sorry.
CHANDLER: Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
ROSS: So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
CHANDLER: Hmm mmmhm..
ROSS: We are even, right?
CHANDLER: Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
ROSS: What did you do to my mom?
CHANDLER: Not her!
RACHEL: I am sooo drunk.
MONICA: That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
CHANDLER: Soo... you girls having fun?
MONICA: For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
MONICA: Oh THATS ME!
RACHEL: I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
CHANDLER: Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
RACHEL: Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
CHANDLER: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
RACHEL: Oh, what a line.
CHANDLER: So where are you applying to?
RACHEL: Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
CHANDLER: I'm in college and I'm in a band.
RACHEL: Yeah okay.
PHOEBE: You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
RACHEL: No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
RACHEL: So maybe something in an office.
PHOEBE: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
PHOEBE: There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
PHOEBE: Finish it!
PHOEBE: Your last dance. Do it for us.
RACHEL: Really?
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
PHOEBE: Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
PHOEBE: Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
JOEY: Yeah...
JOEY: I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
JOEY: Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
JOEY: Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
JOEY: Things that burn.
JOEY: Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
JOEY: Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
JOEY: Pizza toppings, next!
JOEY: Oh, oh, oh...
JOEY: Girls Chandler could never get?
JOEY: Where?
ROSS: Hey, where's Rachel?
MONICA: She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
ROSS: Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
MONICA: What? When was this?
ROSS: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
MONICA: Oh my God! That's wild!
CHANDLER: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
ROSS: Well, it matters to me.
CHANDLER: Why?
ROSS: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
CHANDLER: You kissed her that night too?
MONICA: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
CHANDLER: Seriously, where did this happen?
ROSS: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
CHANDLER: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
ROSS: Mine.
CHANDLER: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
ROSS: No, she was definitely on my bed.
CHANDLER: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
ROSS: Well, then who was on my bed?
MONICA: OH! Oh, oh!
ROSS: NO! No, no!
MONICA: YES!
ROSS: You were under the pile of coats?
MONICA: I was the pile of coats!
ROSS: OH MY GOD!
MONICA: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
ROSS: You were my first kiss with Rachel?
MONICA: You were my first kiss ever?
CHANDLER: What did I marry into?
PHOEBE: Oh, hey Joey.
JOEY: Uh, hey.
PHOEBE: Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
JOEY: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
JOEY: So he can't come?
PHOEBE: No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
JOEY: Seriously?
PHOEBE: Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
JOEY: I am pretty wisdomous.
PHOEBE: So... what do you say?
JOEY: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
PHOEBE: Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
JOEY: Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
PHOEBE: Oh.
JOEY: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
PHOEBE: Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
MONICA: Well, it matters to me!
PHOEBE: Well, I don't care, so you pick!
MONICA: Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
PHOEBE: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
MONICA: You don't know military time?
PHOEBE: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
MONICA: Just subtract twelve.
PHOEBE: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
MONICA: Six o'clock!
PHOEBE: Ok.
MONICA: Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
PHOEBE: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
MONICA: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
PHOEBE: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
MONICA: Ooh... she backed out.
PHOEBE: She did? Why?
MONICA: I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
PHOEBE: Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
CHANDLER: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey!
CHANDLER: You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
PHOEBE: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
CHANDLER: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
PHOEBE: Rehearse it!
ROSS: Hi!
ROSS: Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
ROSS: That is why!
PHOEBE: So Rach.
RACHEL: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Where is Emma?
RACHEL: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
MONICA: Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
JOEY: Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
JOEY: Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
JOEY: You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
JOEY: Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
CHANDLER: You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
ROSS: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
RACHEL: Uh... November?
ROSS: I wanna say it's not looking good.
RACHEL: Hey Pheebs...
PHOEBE: What's up?
RACHEL: Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
CHANDLER: Heh.
PHOEBE: Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
PHOEBE: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
ROSS: Oh, man!
CHANDLER: This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
ROSS: FOOTBALL!
CHANDLER: Thank you.
MONICA: Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
PHOEBE: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
MONICA: Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
PHOEBE: I don't have a fax machine.
MONICA: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
ROSS: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
CHANDLER: I know, I hate being left out of things.
ROSS: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
CHANDLER: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
CHANDLER: What happened?
ROSS: Who cares, AND?
ROSS: I'll do it!
CHANDLER: M-Me-me-me!
CHANDLER: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
ROSS: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?
ROSS: Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
CHANDLER: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
ROSS: Please, you're going down!
CHANDLER: You are going downer!
ROSS: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
CHANDLER: I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
JOEY: So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
JOEY: Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
JOEY: Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
JOEY: Strike two!
JOEY: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
ROSS: So, what did you decide?
PHOEBE: I decided to pee.
CHANDLER: Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
PHOEBE: Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
CHANDLER: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
RACHEL: Goody, what is it!
PHOEBE: Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
RACHEL: What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
PHOEBE: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
ROSS: I'll do it!
MONICA: Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
MONICA: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
MONICA: It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
PHOEBE: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
PHOEBE: And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
MONICA: What?
PHOEBE: YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
PHOEBE: Hey!
RACHEL: Happy wedding day!
PHOEBE: Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
RACHEL: Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
JOEY: Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
MONICA: Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
PHOEBE: Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
MONICA: Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
PHOEBE: Wow, this is a lot!
MONICA: Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
PHOEBE: You won awards?
MONICA: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: Hi.
ROSS: Where's Rach?
MONICA: She's in her room, why?
ROSS: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
RACHEL: What d'you want?
ROSS: You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
RACHEL: Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
ROSS: I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
RACHEL: Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
ROSS: Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
RACHEL: Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
ROSS: YES, YES!
PHOEBE: Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
MONICA: I know.
PHOEBE: Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
PHOEBE: Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
JOEY: Hello Michael.
JOEY: May I have a word with you, please?
JOEY: Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
JOEY: More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
JOEY: I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
JOEY: That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
JOEY: That was ME!
RACHEL: Hi
CHANDLER: Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
RACHEL: Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
CHANDLER: Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
RACHEL: All right fine, I pick you.
CHANDLER: Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
RACHEL: Oh my...
PHOEBE: No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
JOEY: I'm glad we had this little talk.
PHOEBE: Okay.
MONICA: Bye.
PHOEBE: Oh my God, what's it doing here?
MONICA: Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
PHOEBE: Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
JOEY: How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
CHANDLER: How's it going?
ROSS: Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
CHANDLER: That's what I was doing too.
ROSS: Well, you have fun tonight.
CHANDLER: You too.
ROSS: Oh, I will.
CHANDLER: Me too.
ROSS: Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
CHANDLER: I'm not supposed to tell you.
ROSS: I'm not supposed to tell you!
CHANDLER: You told us both we could be in the wedding?
RACHEL: Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
ROSS: Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
CHANDLER: Rach, Rach, knock knock.
RACHEL: Who's there?
CHANDLER: I'll tell you at the wedding.
RACHEL: Uh.
RACHEL: You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
ROSS: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
RACHEL: Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
PHOEBE: Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
MONICA: How's it going?
PHOEBE: Help me.
MONICA: What?
PHOEBE: I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
MONICA: Really?
PHOEBE: Please?
MONICA: You really want me to come back?
PHOEBE: More than I wanna get married.
MONICA: Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
JOEY: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
PHOEBE: About what?
JOEY: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
MONICA: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
JOEY: I don't think they are.
ROSS: Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
MONICA: Well, the club lost it's power.
JOEY: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
RACHEL: Since when do you watch the news?
JOEY: Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
ROSS: I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
PHOEBE: I know.
RACHEL: Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
PHOEBE: What?
RACHEL: Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
PHOEBE: What do you think?
PHOEBE: Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
MONICA: AFFIRMATIVE!
MONICA: OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
CHANDLER: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
ROSS: No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
CHANDLER: I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
ROSS: Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
MONICA: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
JOEY: Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
MONICA: Really?
JOEY: Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
ROSS: Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
JOEY: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
MONICA: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
CHANDLER: I'll do it.
ROSS: I'll...
CHANDLER: Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
MONICA: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
MONICA: Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
PHOEBE: Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
MONICA: So, you're ready to do this?
PHOEBE: Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
RACHEL: Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
PHOEBE: Oh, thank you.
MONICA: I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
PHOEBE: I love you guys.
MONICA: Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
CHANDLER: Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
MONICA: I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah!
MONICA: Okay Marjorie, hit it.
RACHEL: Geez Ross, you could have showered.
ROSS: It's the dog.
MONICA: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
CHANDLER: Ready?
PHOEBE: Okay.
CHANDLER: Okay.
PHOEBE: Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
CHANDLER: Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
PHOEBE: I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
CHANDLER: You look beautiful.
PHOEBE: Thank you.
PHOEBE: Na-ah.
JOEY: Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
JOEY: Okay...
PHOEBE: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family.
PHOEBE: Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
ROSS: Uh Joey...
JOEY: Yeah?
ROSS: Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
JOEY: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
PHOEBE: I do.
JOEY: Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
JOEY: I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
PHOEBE: I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
CHANDLER: That really was an incredible wedding.
JOEY: It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
CHANDLER: I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
JOEY: Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
CHANDLER: I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
ROSS: Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
PHOEBE: Hi
RACHEL: How was the honeymoon?
RACHEL: Oh!
CHANDLER: So, where's Mike?
PHOEBE: Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
JOEY: Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
PHOEBE: Oh, why? What's up?
JOEY: I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
ROSS: Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
MONICA: Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
ROSS: It was ok...
RACHEL: I did not know you spoke French.
PHOEBE: Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
RACHEL: Oh... you're so sexy!
JOEY: Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
PHOEBE: Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
RACHEL: Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: Hey.
CHANDLER: Why are you wearing my apron?
MONICA: I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
CHANDLER: Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
ROSS: Hey.
MONICA: Hey.
ROSS: You guys know where Rachel is?
MONICA: No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
ROSS: So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
MONICA: Hey!
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: These are for Erica!
ROSS: What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
MONICA: Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
ROSS: So, why is Erica coming to visit?
MONICA: Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
CHANDLER: Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
MONICA: Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
ROSS: Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
RACHEL: Ross...
ROSS: No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
RACHEL: My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney’s.
ROSS: Oh my God.
MONICA: Honey.
CHANDLER: I'm so sorry...
ROSS: Is-is he ok?
RACHEL: Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
ROSS: Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
RACHEL: No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
ROSS: Still-still, let me come... for me.
RACHEL: Ok. If you really need to.
ROSS: I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
RACHEL: Oh, I really could.
ROSS: Oh!
RACHEL: Ohh...
PHOEBE: All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
JOEY: Je de coup Clow.
PHOEBE: Well, just... let's try it again.
JOEY: Ok.
PHOEBE: Je m'appelle Claude.
JOEY: Je depli mblue.
PHOEBE: Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
JOEY: Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
PHOEBE: It does, really?
JOEY: Yeah.
PHOEBE: All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
JOEY: Got it.
PHOEBE: Je m'appelle Claude.
JOEY: Je te flouppe Fli.
PHOEBE: Oh, mon Dieu!
JOEY: Oh, de fuff!
MONICA: Hey you guys.
PHOEBE: Hi!
JOEY: Hey.
MONICA: I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
PHOEBE: Oh!
MONICA: Joey. Erica, baby!
JOEY: Hi.
MONICA: Everyone. Erica, baby!
CHANDLER: Monica. Calm, self.
JOEY: Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
CHANDLER: Why would you say that?
PHOEBE: Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
JOEY: Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
CHANDLER: Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
RACHEL: Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
ROSS: And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
RACHEL: Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
RACHEL: Can somebody please go in?
ROSS: Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
RACHEL: Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
ROSS: I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
ROSS: I'm feeling better.
RACHEL: Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
RACHEL: Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
ROSS: He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
ROSS: Did the TV wake you?
ROSS: Ouchy.
ROSS: Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
ROSS: Right, is it painful?
ROSS: Nope, just the one. RACH!
PHOEBE: Je m'appelle Claude.
JOEY: Je do call blue!
PHOEBE: Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
JOEY: je.
PHOEBE: m'ap
JOEY: mah
PHOEBE: pelle
JOEY: pel.
PHOEBE: Great, ok faster! "je"
JOEY: je.
PHOEBE: m'ap
JOEY: mah
PHOEBE: pelle
JOEY: pel.
PHOEBE: Je m'appelle!
JOEY: Me pooh pooh!
PHOEBE: Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
JOEY: What are you doing?
PHOEBE: I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
JOEY: Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
ROSS: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi!
ROSS: I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
RACHEL: Uh. Did you call your parents?
ROSS: Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
RACHEL: Oh good.
ROSS: Wow.
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
RACHEL: What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
ROSS: Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
RACHEL: Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
ROSS: Sorry. . You ok?
RACHEL: Yeah.
ROSS: You had a rough day, uh?
RACHEL: Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
ROSS: But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
RACHEL: Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
ROSS: What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
RACHEL: Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
ROSS: No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
RACHEL: Ok, maybe you're right.
ROSS: Good night.
RACHEL: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
ROSS: Sure!
RACHEL: Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
ROSS: Oh, of course...
RACHEL: Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
ROSS: Me too. Come here.
RACHEL: I just don't want to be alone tonight.
ROSS: Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
RACHEL: Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
ROSS: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
RACHEL: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
ROSS: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
RACHEL: Wow. Ok.
ROSS: I'll see you in the morning .
RACHEL: Mhm-mh!
ROSS: Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
MONICA: Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
CHANDLER: New York is awesome!
MONICA: What is with you?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
MONICA: Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
MONICA: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
CHANDLER: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
CHANDLER: That's great.
MONICA: How's that now?
CHANDLER: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
MONICA: Was he falsely accused of something?
CHANDLER: I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
MONICA: Are you awake?
CHANDLER: Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
MONICA: Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
CHANDLER: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
MONICA: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
CHANDLER: I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
MONICA: How?
CHANDLER: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
MONICA: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
CHANDLER: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
JOEY: Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
JOEY: Thank you.
PHOEBE: Hey Joey.
JOEY: Hey!
PHOEBE: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
JOEY: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
PHOEBE: Really, can I hear some of it.
JOEY: Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
PHOEBE: Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
JOEY: Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
PHOEBE: How could you possibly think that?
JOEY: For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
ROSS: Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
RACHEL: Sure.
ROSS: You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
RACHEL: Hmm-hmm.
ROSS: You sure you're alright?
RACHEL: Yep.
ROSS: O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
RACHEL: FYI..
ROSS: There it is...
RACHEL: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
ROSS: Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
RACHEL: Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
ROSS: Well...
RACHEL: Oh stop that!
ROSS: I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
ROSS: Hey, I was looking out for you.
RACHEL: Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
ROSS: I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
RACHEL: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
ROSS: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
CHANDLER: Hey! How was lunch?
CHANDLER: Oh, really?
CHANDLER: O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
MONICA: Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
CHANDLER: Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
MONICA: No it's not.
CHANDLER: How do you know?
CHANDLER: Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
MONICA: The thing we never do.
CHANDLER: Shovely Joe!
JOEY: Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
JOEY: Dude, come on! French it u-up!
JOEY: Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
PHOEBE: Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
JOEY: Sa-sa-saw!
PHOEBE: Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé.
PHOEBE: Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...
JOEY: Ah. All right. But my French was good?
JOEY: Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
PHOEBE: Merci. Au revoir.
JOEY: Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
ROSS: Emma's down for the night.
RACHEL: Oh, good.
ROSS: So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
RACHEL: Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
ROSS: Oh, no problem.
RACHEL: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
ROSS: Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
RACHEL: It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
ROSS: Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
RACHEL: Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
ROSS: Oh, ye-ah!
RACHEL: You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
ROSS: ...Valentine's day...
RACHEL: Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
ROSS: Hmmm-mmmm.
RACHEL: Not even one more time?
ROSS: Not even once.
RACHEL: No matter how much we want it.
ROSS: Even if we want it really bad.
RACHEL: That's what we decided.
ROSS: Uhm, right!
RACHEL: ...It's kinda hard though!
ROSS: Yeah.
RACHEL: You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
ROSS: ...I hate waste.
RACHEL: ...Ross?
ROSS: Yes?
RACHEL: Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
ROSS: Damn it. It's never off the table.
PHOEBE: Okay, can you really tapdance?
JOEY: No.
PHOEBE: It's off the resumé.
PHOEBE: Archery?
JOEY: No.
PHOEBE: Horseback riding?
JOEY: Would fall off a lot.
PHOEBE: You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
JOEY: That I can do.
PHOEBE: Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
JOEY: All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
PHOEBE: Ready... GO!
PHOEBE: You did it!
PHOEBE: Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
MONICA: Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
CHANDLER: You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
ROSS: Hey, you guys... I have great news.
MONICA: Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
ROSS: Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
CHANDLER: A dinosaur died a million years ago?
ROSS: Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
PHOEBE: Wow!
ROSS: Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
RACHEL: Hi you guys.
RACHEL: Ooh, Italian!
MONICA: No one wanted seconds, right?
ROSS: No, no. I-I'm good.
RACHEL: Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
ROSS: I'm up for tenure.
RACHEL: Congratulations!
ROSS: You too! What are the odds?
RACHEL: Ooh!
JOEY: Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
MONICA: I don't know who I'm happiest for...
PHOEBE: I do, he's been working on that all day!
PHOEBE: Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
MONICA: No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
PHOEBE: Where did you go to do it?
MONICA: Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
CHANDLER: YOU NEVER DID IT!
MONICA: I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
CHANDLER: Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
PHOEBE: Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
PHOEBE: All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
CHANDLER: Mrs Hannigan?
PHOEBE: What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
JOEY: Hey guys.
CHANDLER: Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
JOEY: No, thank you.
MONICA: All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
CHANDLER: Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
JOEY: But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
MONICA: Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
JOEY: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
CHANDLER: Damn it.
MONICA: See you guys later.
PHOEBE: Okay!
MONICA: I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
PHOEBE: Good for you. That was really mature.
JOEY: What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
PHOEBE: Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
PHOEBE: All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
JOEY: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
JOEY: I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
RACHEL: Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
RACHEL: Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
RACHEL: But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
RACHEL: Sssshhhh!
RACHEL: Hi... I'm on a date...
RACHEL: Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
RACHEL: Oh.
RACHEL: Yes, hi!
RACHEL: Hi! Excuse us.
RACHEL: Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
RACHEL: Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
RACHEL: Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
RACHEL: What? I-I don't.
RACHEL: No, I-I-I love it there.
PHOEBE: This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
PHOEBE: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
PHOEBE: Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
PHOEBE: Well, not anything, I mean...
PHOEBE: Oh, this could take a while.
PHOEBE: Okay.
PHOEBE: Hey!
MONICA: Hey Pheebs.
PHOEBE: Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
MONICA: Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
PHOEBE: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
CHANDLER: That's what we were gonna name the baby.
MONICA: Phoebe!
PHOEBE: Uh! Princess Consuela.
MONICA: You seriously changed your name to that?
PHOEBE: Uh-huh!
MONICA: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
PHOEBE: Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
CHANDLER: Hey, how'd the interview go?
RACHEL: Oh! It's not good.
CHANDLER: You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
RACHEL: Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
CHANDLER: That is a bad interview.
PHOEBE: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
RACHEL: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
MONICA: Oh God. I'm so sorry.
ROSS: Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
PHOEBE: Ross...
ROSS: I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
ROSS: This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
ROSS: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
CHANDLER: Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
ROSS: I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
RACHEL: Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
ROSS: Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
PHOEBE: Can you?
RACHEL: Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
ROSS: And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
PHOEBE: And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
ROSS: But also knowing it means a lot.
MONICA: But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
ROSS: ...that center around work.
CHANDLER: To Ross!
ROSS: You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
PHOEBE: Oh God!
ROSS: No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
RACHEL: No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
ROSS: Rach, I'm so sorry.
RACHEL: Oh!
ROSS: Great. I feel like an idiot.
RACHEL: No, it's okay, you didn't know.
ROSS: Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
MONICA: Thank you for letting us see the house again.
CHANDLER: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
MONICA: Ah, so glad you decided to come.
JOEY: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
MONICA: No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
JOEY: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
MONICA: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
JOEY: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
MONICA: No it's not!
JOEY: Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
CHANDLER: When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
JOEY: Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
MONICA: Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
JOEY: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
MONICA: Joey, we know that's you.
JOEY: no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
PHOEBE: Welcome back!
PHOEBE: Oh, me too!
PHOEBE: Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
PHOEBE: Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
PHOEBE: Nope.
PHOEBE: Yep.
PHOEBE: Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
PHOEBE: Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
PHOEBE: Mike Crap Bag?
PHOEBE: You're not serious, right?
PHOEBE: Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
PHOEBE: And I love Crap.
JOEY: Ow!
JOEY: Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
JOEY: Oh.
JOEY: I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
JOEY: Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
JOEY: Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
JOEY: Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
JOEY: What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
JOEY: Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
JOEY: Yeah, yeah, I guess.
JOEY: Yeah, maybe.
JOEY: I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
JOEY: Just when I thought we could be friends.
RACHEL: Oh, thank you...
RACHEL: Well, now I don't have to.
RACHEL: Ross, what is taking you so long?
ROSS: I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
RACHEL: Mark? Oh my God!
RACHEL: I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
ROSS: Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
RACHEL: Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
RACHEL: No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
RACHEL: Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
RACHEL: Great! I'll call ya!
ROSS: Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
RACHEL: Oh my God!
ROSS: See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
RACHEL: Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
ROSS: That is Mark?
RACHEL: Yes.
ROSS: I hate that guy.
RACHEL: Oh.
ROSS: No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
RACHEL: What? You don't want me to get a job?
ROSS: Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
RACHEL: Ugh.
ROSS: I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
RACHEL: Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
MONICA: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
CHANDLER: Man, those two dogs are going at it!
JOEY: Hey!
CHANDLER: Hey.
MONICA: Hey, where have you been?
JOEY: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
CHANDLER: Really? What changed your mind?
JOEY: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
CHANDLER: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
JOEY: What?
CHANDLER: Ha! I'm just messing with you.
JOEY: That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
MONICA: Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
JOEY: What? I get my own room?
CHANDLER: You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
JOEY: Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
JOEY: Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
PHOEBE: Thank you, mister Bag.
PHOEBE: Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.
PHOEBE: Er, Rita, this is my husband.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
PHOEBE: Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
PHOEBE: How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
PHOEBE: Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
PHOEBE: It's a funny word.
PHOEBE: ...Oh crap!
ROSS: Hey, is Rachel here?
MONICA: No.
ROSS: She's still at dinner?
MONICA: I guess. Why? Who's she with?
ROSS: That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
CHANDLER: It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
ROSS: We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
MONICA: So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
CHANDLER: Excuse me?
MONICA: Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
CHANDLER: For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
MONICA: Oh, sorry!
RACHEL: Hi you guys!
ROSS: Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
RACHEL: Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
ROSS: Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
RACHEL: Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
ROSS: Should we send something?
CHANDLER: How did the job stuff go?
RACHEL: He offered me one.
CHANDLER: That's great!
ROSS: Congratulations!
RACHEL: I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
ROSS: Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
RACHEL: The job is in Paris.
JOEY: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
JOEY: All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
RACHEL: Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
JOEY: Just flip!
JOEY: Damnit!
CHANDLER: Hey!
JOEY: Hey!
CHANDLER: So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
RACHEL: Oh, that sounds good!
MONICA: Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
RACHEL: It's all done!
MONICA: Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
RACHEL: I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
MONICA: Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
RACHEL: Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
MONICA: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
CHANDLER: Where's your passport?
RACHEL: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
CHANDLER: Well, it's not.
RACHEL: What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
MONICA: Here, let me help you.
RACHEL: Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
MONICA: Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
MONICA: You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
ROSS: Hey!
ROSS: Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
ROSS: Right, no, I understand.
ROSS: No, no, I knew .
ROSS: She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
MONICA: Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
ROSS: Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
MONICA: Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
ROSS: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
MONICA: Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
ROSS: Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
MONICA: Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
ROSS: No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
MONICA: Yeah, it takes two incomes.
ROSS: Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
CHANDLER: Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
ROSS: Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
MONICA: Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
ROSS: What are you guys doing?
JOEY: Try it, I can't feel a thing!
CHANDLER: We're taking a break!
MONICA: From?
CHANDLER: Jumping on the bed?
MONICA: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
ROSS: You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
CHANDLER: No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
JOEY: You guys hear a ringing?
CHANDLER: What the hell is this?
JOEY: Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
ROSS: Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
CHANDLER: I didn't know Monica had these!
JOEY: Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
CHANDLER: Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
ROSS: Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
PHOEBE: Hey!
MONICA: Hey! Where's Mike?
PHOEBE: Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
ROSS: Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
PHOEBE: Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
ROSS: Rock on!
MONICA: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
JOEY: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.
ROSS: Hey, where's Rach?
JOEY: Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
ROSS: Great.
JOEY: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
MONICA: Yeah.
ROSS: Here she is!
JOEY: What did I just say?
RACHEL: No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
MONICA: Come here, I'll make you a drink.
ROSS: Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
CHANDLER: I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
ROSS: Yeah?
JOEY: Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
CHANDLER: Yes, Joe?
JOEY: I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
RACHEL: Well, I've been better.
PHOEBE: Uh-hmm.
RACHEL: You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
PHOEBE: Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
RACHEL: I'm gonna miss you so much.
PHOEBE: I know.
RACHEL: You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
ROSS: Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
JOEY: Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
RACHEL: Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
PHOEBE: Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
RACHEL: Oh, oh. . What is this?
PHOEBE: It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
RACHEL: I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
MONICA: Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
CHANDLER: Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
MONICA: What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
MONICA: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
CHANDLER: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
MONICA: Rachel used to live in that room.
CHANDLER: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
MONICA: Joey's bare ass!
CHANDLER: . Well played.
RACHEL: I love you Phoebe.
PHOEBE: I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
RACHEL: All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
PHOEBE: Ok.
RACHEL: Ok. Monica?
MONICA: Yeah?
RACHEL: Can you come here with me for a minute?
MONICA: Sure.
PHOEBE: Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
MONICA: No.
PHOEBE: Oh, you're so screwed.
ROSS: Hey. What was that all about?
PHOEBE: She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
ROSS: Are you kidding? Oh my God...
PHOEBE: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
ROSS: Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
RACHEL: Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
MONICA: I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
RACHEL: I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
MONICA: You're the best friend I ever had.
MONICA: What?
RACHEL: I... I... I...
MONICA: That is so sweet.
ROSS: Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
CHANDLER: Uh, Rach?
ROSS: Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
JOEY: I really made you think about that thing uh?
CHANDLER: Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
RACHEL: Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
CHANDLER: No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
RACHEL: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
CHANDLER: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
RACHEL: Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
CHANDLER: Pheebs!
PHOEBE: Yeah!
CHANDLER: I think these are yours.
PHOEBE: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
RACHEL: Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
CHANDLER: Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
PHOEBE: Where do you think Mike really is?
RACHEL: Oh honey...
CHANDLER: Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
RACHEL: Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
CHANDLER: Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
RACHEL: Okay. Oh...
RACHEL: Oh!
CHANDLER: I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
MONICA: So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
ROSS: I don't think so.
CHANDLER: Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
MONICA: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
CHANDLER: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
ROSS: God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
PHOEBE: I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
ROSS: Okay, here we go...
RACHEL: Oh... Well...
ROSS: Yeah...
RACHEL: I think I'm gonna take off.
ROSS: Huh?
RACHEL: Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
ROSS: What? I don't get a goodbye?
JOEY: Lucky bastard!
ROSS: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
MONICA: Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
ROSS: Well, it needs to be plicit.
JOEY: All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
ROSS: No, I don't think so.
PHOEBE: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
MONICA: Yeah. Mine too.
CHANDLER: Mine was a humdinger
ROSS: O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
PHOEBE: Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
MONICA: And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
ROSS: THE HELL I DO!
ROSS: I don't get a goodbye?
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
RACHEL: Ross...
ROSS: Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
MONICA: I hope Ross isn't too upset.
JOEY: I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
PHOEBE: Tell me about it.
CHANDLER: Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
PHOEBE: All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
MONICA: Uh, where do you think you're going?
PHOEBE: I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
MONICA: We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
CHANDLER: Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
JOEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
MONICA: Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
CHANDLER: You couldn't be cool.
MONICA: Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
MONICA: Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
CHANDLER: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
MONICA: You did? How?
CHANDLER: Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
MONICA: Oh my God! Let me see.
JOEY: Who's that dirty old lady?
CHANDLER: Monica's grandmother.
MONICA: Nana liked it rough!
JOEY: Come on here, have a seat.
PHOEBE: How was your night?
MONICA: Erica, are you okay?
MONICA: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: Relax! We just get her some antacids.
MONICA: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
CHANDLER: Oh my God!
PHOEBE: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
MONICA: All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
CHANDLER: Honey, it's gonna be okay.
MONICA: Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
MONICA: Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
JOEY: Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
RACHEL: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
ROSS: That's what it seemed like.
RACHEL: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
ROSS: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
RACHEL: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
ROSS: Rach!
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: You keep, you keep... You can't...
RACHEL: WHAT?
JOEY: A little more.
PHOEBE: Okay.
JOEY: A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
PHOEBE: All right, ready?
JOEY: Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
PHOEBE: All right, here it goes...
MONICA: Erica, are you okay?
MONICA: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
MONICA: She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
CHANDLER: Oh my God!
RACHEL: So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
ROSS: Rach!
RACHEL: What?!
ROSS: Hey.
RACHEL: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
ROSS: Oh. This was amazing.
RACHEL: It really was. You've learned some new moves!
ROSS: Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
RACHEL: Ah.
ROSS: Who's laughing now?
RACHEL: I know!
MONICA: Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
CHANDLER: Next time, can I say breathe?
MONICA: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
MONICA: Alright, I'll be right back.
CHANDLER: Where are you going?
MONICA: To use the bathroom.
CHANDLER: You can't leave me alone with her.
MONICA: What?
CHANDLER: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
MONICA: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
CHANDLER: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
MONICA: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
CHANDLER: Okay.
CHANDLER: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
CHANDLER: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
CHANDLER: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
CHANDLER: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
PHOEBE: Morning.
JOEY: Hey!
PHOEBE: What's that?
JOEY: It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
PHOEBE: It's a baby chick and duck!
JOEY: Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
PHOEBE: I did not see that coming.
JOEY: Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
PHOEBE: Yes.
JOEY: Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
PHOEBE: That is the rule, though.
PHOEBE: Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
ROSS: What?
JOEY: Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
ROSS: Oh my God!
PHOEBE: Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
ROSS: Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
PHOEBE: Have you seen him throw a ball?
ROSS: Is Rachel here?
JOEY: Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
ROSS: Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
PHOEBE: What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
ROSS: Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
JOEY: Oh my God. You and Rachel?
ROSS: I know, it's pretty great.
JOEY: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
ROSS: Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
PHOEBE: But do you wanna get back together?
ROSS: I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
PHOEBE: YAY!
ROSS: Shhh!
PHOEBE: Yay!
JOEY: So, so is she still going to Paris?
ROSS: Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
PHOEBE: Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
RACHEL: Morning!
PHOEBE: Guess we'll never know how it ends.
JOEY: Okay.
ROSS: Hey.
RACHEL: Hey.
ROSS: Hey. How did you sleep?
RACHEL: Good. You?
ROSS: Good.
JOEY: I bet you did!
ROSS: Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
JOEY: Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
RACHEL: Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
PHOEBE: Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
ROSS: So...
ROSS: Morning.
RACHEL: You too. Last night was just wonderful.
ROSS: It really was.
RACHEL: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
ROSS: I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
RACHEL: Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
MONICA: It's just a little bit more, honey.
CHANDLER: Is it really that bad?
MONICA: Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
CHANDLER: I'm okay.
MONICA: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
CHANDLER: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
MONICA: It's a... It's a boy!
CHANDLER: Wow!
MONICA: Oh, you did it!
CHANDLER: It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
CHANDLER: Well, that's spongy.
MONICA: Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
CHANDLER: I know. He has your eyes.
CHANDLER: I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
CHANDLER: Okay.
MONICA: Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
CHANDLER: How do you feel?
MONICA: I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
MONICA: We only ordered one!
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
CHANDLER: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
MONICA: Wait, did you know it was twins?
MONICA: Anybody tell you?
MONICA: This is unbelievable.
CHANDLER: Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
CHANDLER: What do we do?
MONICA: What do you mean "what do we do"?
CHANDLER: Twins! Twins!!
MONICA: Chandler, you're panicking!
CHANDLER: Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
MONICA: We can't split them up!
CHANDLER: Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
MONICA: Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
CHANDLER: What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
MONICA: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
CHANDLER: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
MONICA: That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
CHANDLER: Okay. Shhh...
CHANDLER: Okay.
MONICA: Okay!
CHANDLER: Okay!
CHANDLER: She? It's a girl?
CHANDLER: Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
ROSS: And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
JOEY: Oh my God! What did you say?
ROSS: Nothing! What do you say to that?
PHOEBE: Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
ROSS: No way!
JOEY: You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
ROSS: What?
JOEY: Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
PHOEBE: Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
ROSS: You really think so?
PHOEBE: I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
RACHEL: Hi!
PHOEBE: Can't a girl finish a song around here?
JOEY: Hey!
RACHEL: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
ROSS: Okay.
JOEY: Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
RACHEL: No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
PHOEBE: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
RACHEL: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
ROSS: Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
JOEY: Ross, wait!
ROSS: What? What?
JOEY: Could you get me a muffin?
RACHEL: Yeah?
RACHEL: Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
RACHEL: Oh... Bye guys.
ROSS: Oh my God!
PHOEBE: Unbelievable!
JOEY: Hey, you know what might help?
ROSS: I'm not getting you a muffin!
MONICA: Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
CHANDLER: Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
MONICA: There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
MONICA: Son of a gun, it is!
MONICA: Okay, well, bye!
CHANDLER: Bye!
MONICA: We'll call you!
CHANDLER: Have fun at church-camp!
MONICA: Oh, look at these little bunnies!
CHANDLER: I know! You ready to trade?
MONICA: Okay.
CHANDLER: Okay.
MONICA: Alright, let's see..
CHANDLER: We could trade later.
MONICA: Yeah, I'm good.
PHOEBE: Hey, what are you working on?
JOEY: It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
PHOEBE: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
JOEY: No, I sat in the paint.
ROSS: Hey.
PHOEBE: Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
ROSS: No, and I'm not going to.
PHOEBE: What?
JOEY: Why not?
ROSS: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
PHOEBE: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
ROSS: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
JOEY: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
PHOEBE: Uh, Joe?
JOEY: Damn it!
ROSS: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
PHOEBE: No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
PHOEBE: Hey! What do you have there?
ROSS: Oh my God! You did that yourself?
PHOEBE: Honey, that's gorgeous!
JOEY: You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
RACHEL: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
JOEY: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
PHOEBE: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
RACHEL: Oh my God!
ROSS: Oh my God!
RACHEL: Hi! Oh my gosh!
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: Hey, so what is the big surprise?
RACHEL: Oh.
ROSS: Oh my God!
RACHEL: What... What...
ROSS: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
MONICA: Yes, it's twins!
ROSS: Oh my God.
JOEY: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
MONICA: This is a boy, and that's a girl.
CHANDLER: Her name is Erica.
RACHEL: Aw..
JOEY: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
CHANDLER: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
MONICA: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
ROSS: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
PHOEBE: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
RACHEL: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
PHOEBE: One? How about a whole bunch?
PHOEBE: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
RACHEL: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
MONICA: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
RACHEL: Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
MONICA: I love you.
CHANDLER: I love you.
MONICA: Call us when you get there.
RACHEL: I will. Ross, come here.
RACHEL: I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
ROSS: Neither will I.
RACHEL: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
PHOEBE: So, you just let her go?
ROSS: Yeah.
JOEY: Hey, maybe that's for the best.
ROSS: Yeah?
JOEY: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
PHOEBE: But now she'll never know how he feels!
JOEY: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
JOEY: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
ROSS: Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
JOEY: What?
ROSS: I don't! I wanna be with her.
JOEY: Really?
ROSS: Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
JOEY: Yeah, you are!
PHOEBE: Woo!
PHOEBE: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
ROSS: My coat...
JOEY: This is so cool!
CHANDLER: I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
JOEY: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
ROSS: I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
PHOEBE: You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
ROSS: Okay, guys, wish me luck.
PHOEBE: Hurry!
JOEY: Good luck, good luck!
ROSS: There's no seatbelt!
PHOEBE: That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
ROSS: Alright, alright, let's do this!
PHOEBE: Okay!
ROSS: Hey!
PHOEBE: I - I don't take passengers.
ROSS: No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
PHOEBE: My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
ROSS: Get out of the cab!
PHOEBE: Get out of the cab!
JOEY: Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
MONICA: Now, that you can do.
JOEY: Alright!
JOEY: Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
PHOEBE: You can open your eyes now.
ROSS: Are we off the bridge?
PHOEBE: Yes.
ROSS: Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
PHOEBE: Yes, she jumped right back up.
ROSS: Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
PHOEBE: Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
ROSS: Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
PHOEBE: You should have thought of that before you got in!
PHOEBE: Toll-booth.
ROSS: What?
PHOEBE: Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
PHOEBE: Hurry!
ROSS: Okay!
PHOEBE: Okay.
PHOEBE: Damn, that window is clean.
JOEY: Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
CHANDLER: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
JOEY: Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
CHANDLER: Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
MONICA: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
JOEY: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
CHANDLER: Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
MONICA: Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
CHANDLER: Alright.
MONICA: Oh God! What did I just step on?
JOEY: Oh!
CHANDLER: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
MONICA: Oh..
JOEY: You stepped on my egg roll?
MONICA: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
JOEY: Just put it on a plate and leave.
CHANDLER: Okay, let's find these birds.
JOEY: Alright.
JOEY: Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
JOEY: Oh! They're in the table!
CHANDLER: Well, that can't be good!
JOEY: We gotta get them out of there!
CHANDLER: How?
JOEY: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
CHANDLER: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
JOEY: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
CHANDLER: Joey, wait! The ball!
JOEY: Oh!
JOEY: Oh God! So what do we do?
CHANDLER: I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
JOEY: Okay.
CHANDLER: No... It's all glued together.
JOEY: Does that mean we have to bust it open?
CHANDLER: I don't know. Maybe.
JOEY: Oh my God!
CHANDLER: I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
JOEY: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
CHANDLER: Did that movie ever get made?
JOEY: It did not.
PHOEBE: Ross, where are you going?
ROSS: To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
PHOEBE: What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
ROSS: Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
PHOEBE: You have to get a ticket to get past security.
ROSS: What? We're never gonna make it!
PHOEBE: Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
ROSS: Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
RACHEL: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
RACHEL: Oh.
RACHEL: Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
RACHEL: I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
RACHEL: Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
ROSS: Hey, I need a ticket.
PHOEBE: Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
ROSS: Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
PHOEBE: We're on our honeymoon.
ROSS: I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
PHOEBE: I'm so lucky I married you.
RACHEL: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
RACHEL: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
ROSS: Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
PHOEBE: No, did we miss it?
ROSS: No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
PHOEBE: Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
MONICA: Hello.
PHOEBE: Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
ROSS: What? Hey, hey, listen..
MONICA: Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
ROSS: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
MONICA: Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
ROSS: That's alright. Listen, listen.
MONICA: Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
ROSS: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
MONICA: Isn't that cute?
ROSS: That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
MONICA: Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
ROSS: Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
MONICA: That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
ROSS: What?
MONICA: Newark airport. Why, where are you?
ROSS: JFK.
JOEY: Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
CHANDLER: And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
JOEY: Okay. Here goes.
CHANDLER: What's the matter?
JOEY: I need to say goodbye to the table first.
CHANDLER: I understand.
JOEY: Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
CHANDLER: I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
JOEY: Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
CHANDLER: Well, I can't do it either.
MONICA: Hey! Did you find them?
JOEY: Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
CHANDLER: We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
MONICA: Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
ROSS: Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
PHOEBE: Well, I've never gone this fast before.
ROSS: Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
PHOEBE: She's got her cell, you could call her.
ROSS: I am not doing this over the phone.
PHOEBE: You don't have any other choice!
RACHEL: Hello?
PHOEBE: Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
RACHEL: Yeah.
PHOEBE: For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
ROSS: Yay.
PHOEBE: Uh, Rach, hang on.
RACHEL: Phoebe? Is everything okay?
PHOEBE: Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
RACHEL: What? Why?
PHOEBE: I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
RACHEL: Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
RACHEL: Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
RACHEL: Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
RACHEL: I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
RACHEL: Well...
RACHEL: Wait, what are you doing?
RACHEL: Could I get some peanuts?
RACHEL: This is ridiculous! I...
RACHEL: Yeah, okay.
MONICA: Alright. My job here is done.
CHANDLER: That was... Impressive.
JOEY: Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
MONICA: Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
CHANDLER: Sorry about the table, man.
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: You gonna buy a new one?
JOEY: Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
CHANDLER: Well, at least we got these little guys out.
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
JOEY: I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
CHANDLER: Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
JOEY: What?
CHANDLER: Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
JOEY: I could get a goose!
CHANDLER: You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
JOEY: Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
CHANDLER: I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
JOEY: Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
ROSS: Where is she?
PHOEBE: I don't see her.
ROSS: Rachel! Rachel Green!
PHOEBE: There she is!
ROSS: Rachel! Rachel!
ROSS: No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
ROSS: No, no, no, but...
PHOEBE: RACHEL!!
RACHEL: Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
PHOEBE: Okay, you're on.
RACHEL: What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
ROSS: Okay, the thing is..
RACHEL: Yeah?
ROSS: Don't go.
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
RACHEL: Oh my God.
ROSS: I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
ROSS: Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
RACHEL: I - I have to get on the plane.
ROSS: No, you don't.
RACHEL: Yes, I do.
ROSS: No, you don't.
RACHEL: They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
ROSS: Rachel?
RACHEL: I'm so sorry.
ROSS: I really thought she'd stay.
PHOEBE: I'm sorry.
MONICA: Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
CHANDLER: Wow, this is weird.
MONICA: I know.
JOEY: Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
MONICA: I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
JOEY: I love you!
JOEY: Hey!
PHOEBE: Hey.
JOEY: So did you guys make it in time?
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
CHANDLER: Where's Ross?
PHOEBE: He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
RACHEL: Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
ROSS: Oh my God!
RACHEL: Excuse me?
RACHEL: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
ROSS: Let her off the plane!
RACHEL: Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
ROSS: Try to understand!
RACHEL: Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
ROSS: No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
RACHEL: I got off the plane.
ROSS: You got off the plane.
RACHEL: I do love you.
ROSS: I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
RACHEL: Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
ROSS: Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
RACHEL: Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
ROSS: This is it. Unless we're on a break.
ROSS: Don't make jokes now.
MONICA: Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
MONICA: If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
ROSS: Wow.
RACHEL: I know. It seems smaller somehow.
JOEY: Has it always been purple?
CHANDLER: Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
PHOEBE: Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
MONICA: Oh, yeah, that's true.
ROSS: Uh, I haven't.
MONICA: Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
ROSS: Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
MONICA: Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
CHANDLER: Oh, okay.
PHOEBE: So, I guess this is it.
JOEY: Yeah. I guess so.
MONICA: This is harder than I thought it would be.
CHANDLER: Oh, it's gonna be okay.
RACHEL: Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
MONICA: We got some time.
RACHEL: Okay, should we get some coffee?
CHANDLER: Sure. Where?
CHANDLER: How did the job stuff go?
RACHEL: He offered me one.
ROSS: You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
RACHEL: The job is in Paris.
RACHEL: Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
ROSS: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
CHANDLER: Or facing a bitch of a commute.
RACHEL: I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
ROSS: Okay.
RACHEL: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
CHANDLER: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
ROSS: All right, we'll work it out.
RACHEL: Thank you! Thank you!
ROSS: Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?
RACHEL: I think it is.
PHOEBE: Ooh, what's going on?
RACHEL: I got a really incredible job offer.
JOEY: Hey, great! All right!
PHOEBE: Good for you!
RACHEL: It's in Paris.
JOEY: What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
MONICA: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
JOEY: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
RACHEL: Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
PHOEBE: Of course we can. Congratulations.  Yay!  Joey...
JOEY: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
RACHEL: Joey, it would mean so...
JOEY: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
RACHEL: Joey...
PHOEBE: You okay with this?
CHANDLER: Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
PHOEBE: Talking to Ross.
CHANDLER: I see.
ROSS: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
MONICA: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
ROSS: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
MONICA: How is that gonna happen?
CHANDLER: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
ROSS: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
MONICA: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
ROSS: I didn't say we were brothers.
MONICA: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
CHANDLER: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
MONICA: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
CHANDLER: What do you think Pheebs?
PHOEBE: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
CHANDLER: Yeah.
PHOEBE: She died.
CHANDLER: You're kidding!
MONICA: That's terrible!
PHOEBE: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
CHANDLER: Oh yeah?
PHOEBE: Yeah, she was just an agent.
MONICA: Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
CHANDLER: I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
PHOEBE: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
MONICA: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
PHOEBE: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
MONICA: What if he reads it in the paper?
CHANDLER: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
ROSS: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
ROSS: Close. Ron.
ROSS: Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
ROSS: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
ROSS: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
ROSS: Huh, I took a shot there.
ROSS: I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
ROSS: Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
ROSS: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
ROSS: You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
ROSS: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
ROSS: He'll be fine.
JOEY: Hey Phoebe.
PHOEBE: Hey. Everything ok?
JOEY: I'm just mad at my agent.
PHOEBE: Estelle? Why?
JOEY: There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
PHOEBE: I'm guessing she does.
JOEY: Well  I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
PHOEBE: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
JOEY: Ok. Why?
PHOEBE: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
JOEY: I love that saying! .
JOEY: Hello?
PHOEBE: Joey, it's Estelle.
JOEY: I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
JOEY: Yeah, actually I am!
JOEY: That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
JOEY: No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
JOEY: I'm saying that… . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. .
PHOEBE: Man, tough week for Estelle!
ROSS: Hi.
RACHEL: Hi.
ROSS: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
RACHEL: Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
ROSS: Ok.
RACHEL: Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
ROSS: Nooo!
RACHEL: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
ROSS: So, you're not going to Paris.
RACHEL: No, I'm still going.
ROSS: Wh… wh…what?
RACHEL: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
ROSS: Yeeeah!
MONICA: Thanks.
CHANDLER: It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
MONICA: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
MONICA: Love it!
MONICA: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
CHANDLER: Sure.
PHOEBE: Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
JOEY: Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
PHOEBE: No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
JOEY: I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
PHOEBE: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you
JOEY: Why?
PHOEBE: Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
JOEY: You blow me away.
PHOEBE: All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
JOEY: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
CHANDLER: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
CHANDLER: Don't, don't!
MONICA: No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
CHANDLER: Why!?
MONICA: I don't know why.
CHANDLER: This can not be happening!
MONICA: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
CHANDLER: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
MONICA: Okay, Okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
CHANDLER: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
MONICA: Okay, you come up with an idea.
CHANDLER: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
MONICA: But we love our house.
CHANDLER: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"!
MONICA: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
CHANDLER: Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too.
ROSS: It's me. Ron.  Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
ROSS: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? 
ROSS: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
ROSS: Huh? So? We have a deal?
ROSS: Yes! yes!
ROSS: Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
ROSS: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
JOEY: Oh my God.  Hello?
PHOEBE: Joey, it's Estelle.
JOEY: Estelle?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
JOEY: Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
PHOEBE: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
JOEY: No, no, no!  Don't drop by, don't drop by!
PHOEBE: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
JOEY: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
PHOEBE: It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
JOEY: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.  "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
CHANDLER: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
CHANDLER: Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
CHANDLER: Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
CHANDLER: I never stopped loving you.
CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
CHANDLER: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
CHANDLER: Obviously.
CHANDLER: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
CHANDLER: I understand.
CHANDLER: They're never coming down now.
RACHEL: Hi!
ROSS: Hey!
RACHEL: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
ROSS: They did?
RACHEL: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
ROSS: So, what are you gonna do?
RACHEL: Well, I took it.
ROSS: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
ROSS: You're excited, right?
RACHEL: Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
ROSS: Right!
RACHEL: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
ROSS: Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
RACHEL: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
ROSS: You should go.
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: It's what you want. You should go.
RACHEL: You really think so?
ROSS: I really do.
RACHEL: But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
ROSS: I'm sure he'll understand.
RACHEL: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
ROSS: Yeah...
RACHEL: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
ROSS: Yeah, yeah, oh!
