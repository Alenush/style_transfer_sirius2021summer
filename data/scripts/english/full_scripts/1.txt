MONICA: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with! 
JOEY: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him! 
CHANDLER: So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece? 
PHOEBE: Wait, does he eat chalk? 
PHOEBE: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh! 
MONICA: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex. 
CHANDLER: Sounds like a date to me. 
CHANDLER: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked. 
ALL: Oh, yeah. Had that dream. 
CHANDLER: Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone... there. 
JOEY: Instead of...? 
CHANDLER: That's right. 
JOEY: Never had that dream. 
PHOEBE: No. 
CHANDLER: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because- she never calls me! 
ROSS: Hi. 
JOEY: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself. 
MONICA: Are you okay, sweetie? 
ROSS: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... 
CHANDLER: Cookie? 
MONICA: Carol moved her stuff out today. Let me get you some coffee. 
PHOEBE: Ooh! Oh! 
ROSS: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. 
MONICA: No you don't. 
ROSS: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me! 
JOEY: And you never knew she was a lesbian... 
ROSS: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know? 
CHANDLER: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud? 
JOEY: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? 
JOEY: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! 
ROSS: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again! 
CHANDLER: And I just want a million dollars! 
MONICA: Rachel?! 
RACHEL: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! 
WAITRESS: Can I get you some coffee? 
MONICA: De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? 
RACHEL: Hi, sure! 
ROSS: Hi. 
MONICA: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? 
RACHEL: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. 
MONICA: Who wasn't invited to the wedding. 
RACHEL: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... 
MONICA: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. 
RACHEL: Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! 
CHANDLER: Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 
JOEY: I say push her down the stairs. 
PHOEBE+ROSS+CHANDLER+JOEY: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! 
RACHEL: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! 
ROSS: You can see where he'd have trouble. 
RACHEL: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. 
MONICA: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica... 
RACHEL: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!! 
MONICA: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things... 
PHOEBE: Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, ..bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la... 
RACHEL: I'm all better now. 
PHOEBE: I helped! 
MONICA: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. 
JOEY: And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot. 
MONICA: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day! 
JOEY: What, like there's a rule or something? 
CHANDLER: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound. 
PAUL: It's, uh, it's Paul. 
MONICA: Buzz him in! 
JOEY: Who's Paul? 
ROSS: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul? 
MONICA: Maybe. 
JOEY: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy? 
ROSS: He finally asked you out? 
MONICA: Yes! 
CHANDLER: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment. 
MONICA: Rach, wait, I can cancel... 
RACHEL: Please, no, go, that'd be fine! 
MONICA: Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? 
ROSS: That'd be good... 
MONICA: Really? 
ROSS: No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy! 
MONICA: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul. 
ALL: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey! 
CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it? 
MONICA: Two seconds. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good. 
ROSS: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight? 
RACHEL: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! 
ROSS: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. 
CHANDLER: Yes, and we're very excited about it. 
RACHEL: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.. 
ROSS: Okay, sure. 
JOEY: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to. 
ROSS: I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs. 
JOEY: What's this? 
CHANDLER: I have no idea. 
JOEY: Done with the bookcase! 
CHANDLER: All finished! 
ROSS: This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known. 
JOEY: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get? 
ROSS: You guys. 
CHANDLER: Oh, man. 
JOEY: You got screwed. 
MONICA: Oh my God! 
PAUL: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? 
MONICA: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it? 
PAUL: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- 
MONICA: -leg? 
PAUL: That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch. 
MONICA: You actually broke her watch? 
RACHEL: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... 
ROSS: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her... 
JOEY: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! 
ROSS: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny. 
CHANDLER: Stay out of my freezer! 
PAUL: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh... 
MONICA: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles? 
PAUL: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation. 
MONICA: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date? 
PAUL: Isn't there? 
MONICA: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say? 
PAUL: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually. 
MONICA: Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry... 
PAUL: It's okay... 
MONICA: Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long? 
PAUL: Two years. 
MONICA: Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch! 
PAUL: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date? 
MONICA: ...Yeah. Yeah, I do. 
TV: 'I, Joanie, take you, Charles, to be my lawful husband.' 'Do you take...' 
RACHEL: Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference! 
ROSS: Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? 
RACHEL: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life. 
CHANDLER: That is amazing. 
JOEY: Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry... 
ALL: Morning. Good morning. 
PAUL: Morning. 
JOEY: Morning, Paul. 
RACHEL: Hello, Paul. 
CHANDLER: Hi, Paul, is it? 
MONICA: I had a really great time last night. 
PAUL: Thank you. Thank you so much. 
MONICA: We'll talk later. 
PAUL: Yeah. Thank you. 
JOEY: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date? 
MONICA: Shut up, and put my table back. 
ALL: Okayyy! 
CHANDLER: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... 
RACHEL: So, like, you guys all have jobs? 
MONICA: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff. 
JOEY: Yeah, I'm an actor. 
RACHEL: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything? 
JOEY: I doubt it. Mostly regional work. 
MONICA: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio. 
CHANDLER: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.' 
JOEY: I will not take this abuse. 
CHANDLER: You're right, I'm sorry. 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..' 
MONICA: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling. 
RACHEL: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. 
MONICA: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco? 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah. 
MONICA: Well, it's like that. With feelings. 
RACHEL: Oh wow. Are you in trouble. 
MONICA: Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work. 
RACHEL: Oh, look, wish me luck! 
MONICA: What for? 
RACHEL: I'm gonna go get one of those job things. 
FRANNIE: Hey, Monica! 
MONICA: Hey, welcome back! How was Florida? 
FRANNIE: You had sex, didn't you? 
MONICA: How do you do that? 
FRANNIE: So? Who? 
MONICA: You know Paul? 
FRANNIE: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. 
MONICA: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? 
FRANNIE: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. 
JOEY: Of course it was a line! 
MONICA: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? 
ROSS: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. 
MONICA: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
PHOEBE: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. 
MONICA: I just thought he was nice, y'know? 
JOEY: I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! 
RACHEL: Guess what? 
ROSS: You got a job? 
RACHEL: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today. 
CHANDLER: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. 
RACHEL: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off! 
CHANDLER: Oh, how well you know me... 
RACHEL: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots! 
MONICA: How'd you pay for them? 
RACHEL: Uh, credit card. 
MONICA: And who pays for that? 
RACHEL: Um... my... father. 
MONICA: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. 
RACHEL: I know that. That's why I was getting married. 
PHOEBE: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. 
RACHEL: Thank you. 
PHOEBE: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. 
ROSS: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'... 
MONICA: You ready? 
RACHEL: I don't think so. 
ROSS: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... 
ALL: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... 
MONICA: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! 
MONICA: Well, that's it. 
RACHEL: You gonna crash on the couch? 
ROSS: No. No, I gotta go home sometime. 
MONICA: You be okay? 
ROSS: Yeah. 
RACHEL: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What? 
MONICA: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. 
ROSS: Mmm. Oh, no- 
RACHEL: Sorry- 
ROSS: No no no, go- 
RACHEL: No, you have it, really, I don't want it- 
ROSS: Split it? 
RACHEL: Okay. 
ROSS: Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. 
RACHEL: I knew. 
ROSS: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. 
RACHEL: I did. 
ROSS: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? 
RACHEL: Yeah, maybe... 
ROSS: Okay... okay, maybe I will... 
RACHEL: Goodnight. 
ROSS: Goodnight. 
MONICA: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? 
ROSS: I just grabbed a spoon. 
JOEY: I can't believe what I'm hearing here. 
PHOEBE: I can't believe what I'm hearing here... 
MONICA: What? I-I said you had a- 
PHOEBE: What I said... 
MONICA: Would you stop? 
PHOEBE: Oh, was I doing it again? 
RACHEL: Would anybody like more coffee? 
CHANDLER: Did you make it, or are you just serving it? 
RACHEL: I'm just serving it. 
ALL: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. 
CHANDLER: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli- 
PHOEBE: Hi guys! 
ALL: Hey, Pheebs! Hi! 
ROSS: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? 
PHOEBE: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!' 
ALL: Ohh. Ouch. 
RACHEL: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
MONICA: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. 
RACHEL: Since when? 
JOEY: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. 
CHANDLER: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
PHOEBE: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'. 
RACHEL: And everybody knows this? 
JOEY: Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
ROSS: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 
MONICA: Uh, Ross. 
ROSS: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! 
CHANDLER: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
JOEY: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
CHANDLER: Hey, that was really good! 
JOEY: Thanks! Let's keep going. 
CHANDLER: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
JOEY: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." 
CHANDLER: "Smoke away." 
CHANDLER: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
JOEY: What? 
CHANDLER: Relax your hand! 
CHANDLER: Not so much! 
JOEY: Whoah! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Alright, now try taking a puff. 
CHANDLER: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
JOEY: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
CHANDLER: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. 
CHANDLER: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. 
JOEY: Y'miss it? 
CHANDLER: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God. 
MONICA: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. 
JOEY: That's ridiculous! 
ROSS: Can I use.. either thumb? 
RACHEL: Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! 
ALL: Yeah. Yeah, excellent. 
RACHEL: Good for me! 
JOEY: Y'okay, Phoebe? 
PHOEBE: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. 
MONICA: What did they do to you? 
PHOEBE: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- 
ROSS: Easy. 
PHOEBE: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
CHANDLER: Oh, Satan's minions at work again... 
PHOEBE: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. 
JOEY: What are you talking about? Keep it! 
PHOEBE: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing. 
RACHEL: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
PHOEBE: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not- mine'... 
MONICA: We're with you. We got it. 
PHOEBE: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt. 
RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? 
MONICA: Hey. Whaddya doing? 
ALL: Oh! Oh, God! 
ROSS: What is this?! 
CHANDLER: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. 
PHOEBE: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
CHANDLER: And this- is my reward! 
ROSS: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
CHANDLER: Okay, so this time I won't quit! 
ALL: Ohhh! Put it out! 
CHANDLER: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. 
PHOEBE: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 
MONICA: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. 
RACHEL: This Alan again? How's it goin'? 
MONICA: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. 
JOEY: So when do we get to meet the guy? 
MONICA: Let's see, today's Monday... Never. 
ALL: Oh, come on! Come on! 
MONICA: No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
CHANDLER: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry. 
MONICA: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out. 
RACHEL: Well, then can we meet him? 
MONICA: Nope. Schhorry. 
MONICA: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 
PAULA: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. 
MONICA: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 
PAULA: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. 
JOEY: Let it go, Ross. 
ROSS: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. 
MONICA: Do you all promise? 
ALL: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! 
MONICA: Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
JOEY: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! 
ROSS: Hey, Pheebs. 
PHOEBE: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
RACHEL: What bank is this? 
MONICA: Hey. It's him. Who is it? 
ALAN : It's Alan. 
JOEY: Chandler! He's here! 
MONICA: Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me. 
MONICA: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. 
ALAN: Hi. 
ALL: Hi, Alan. 
ALAN: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! 
MONICA: Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? 
MONICA: C'mon! 
ROSS: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. 
ALL: Loved him! Yeah! He's great! 
MONICA: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? 
ALL: Yeah! 
RACHEL: And did you notice...? 
THE GUYS: Yeah. 
JOEY: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
PHOEBE: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! 
ROSS: ...What shoe? 
PHOEBE: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' 
ROSS: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
RACHEL: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. 
MONICA: Really! 
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? 
ROSS: You know what I like most about him, though? 
ALL: What? 
ROSS: The way he makes me feel about myself. 
ALL: Yeah... 
MONICA: Hi.. how was the game? 
ROSS: Well.. 
ALL: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! 
MONICA: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
JOEY: Alan. 
ROSS: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... 
RACHEL: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
CHANDLER: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
MONICA: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. 
ROSS: What? 
MONICA: ..I dunno, a little too Alan? 
RACHEL: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. 
ROSS: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
CHANDLER: I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
PHOEBE: Hey, Lizzie. 
LIZZIE: Hey, Weird Girl. 
PHOEBE: I brought you alphabet soup. 
LIZZIE: Did you pick out the vowels? 
PHOEBE: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. 
LIZZIE: Saltines? 
PHOEBE: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
LIZZIE: What? Oh my God, there's really money in here. 
PHOEBE: I know. 
LIZZIE: Weird Girl, what are you doing? 
PHOEBE: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. 
LIZZIE: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something. 
PHOEBE: Oh, that's fine, no. 
LIZZIE: Would you like my tin-foil hat? 
PHOEBE: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. 
LIZZIE: Please, let me do something. 
PHOEBE: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? 
LIZZIE: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
LIZZIE: Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
PHOEBE: No, I'm fine. 
LIZZIE: See ya. 
PHOEBE: Huh! 
ROSS: A thumb?! 
ALL: Eww! 
PHOEBE: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
CHANDLER: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 
PHOEBE: Does, um, anyone wanna see? 
ALL: Nooo! 
ALL: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! 
RACHEL: It's worse than the thumb! 
CHANDLER: Hey, this is so unfair! 
MONICA: Oh, why is it unfair? 
CHANDLER: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
JOEY: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
RACHEL: Well, I-I could live without it. 
JOEY: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? 
ROSS: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. 
JOEY: Oh, "you do, do you"? 
ROSS: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
RACHEL: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
RACHEL: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. 
MONICA: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
PAULA: No. 
MONICA: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. 
PAULA: Wait wait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through! 
MONICA: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. 
PAULA: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! 
MONICA: I know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
PAULA: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 
MONICA: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. 
JOEY: Do you have any respect for your body? 
ROSS: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
CHANDLER: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
RACHEL: Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. 
CHANDLER: Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! 
RACHEL: God, he's good. 
ROSS: If only he were a woman. 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 
ROSS: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 
MONICA: Hey. Where's Joey? 
CHANDLER: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? 
RACHEL: I think he's across the hall. 
MONICA: Thanks. 
ROSS: There y'go. 
CHANDLER: Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. 
ROSS: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? 
PHOEBE: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
ROSS: Hey, I might! 
PHOEBE: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 
ALL: You're kidding. Oh my God. 
PHOEBE: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?! 
JOEY: What's going on? 
MONICA: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
JOEY: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
RACHEL: Uh, Joey.. 
JOEY: Oh, God! 
MONICA: Okay.. 
ALL: Oh! That was Lambchop! 
MONICA: Please, guys, we have to talk. 
PHOEBE: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. 
MONICA: Alright, we have to talk. 
PHOEBE: There it is! 
MONICA: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. 
ROSS: Is there somebody else? 
MONICA: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. 
RACHEL: We didn't change.. 
JOEY: So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
PHOEBE: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- 
MONICA: Look, I- I could go on pretending- 
JOEY: Okay! 
MONICA: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! 
ROSS: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were. 
MONICA: I'm sorry.. 
CHANDLER: Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
RACHEL: I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family- 
MONICA: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. 
ALL: Oh, yeah! Right! 
MONICA: Are you guys gonna be okay? 
ROSS: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. 
MONICA: I understand. 
ALAN: Wow. 
MONICA: I'm, I'm really sorry. 
ALAN: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. 
MONICA: Relieved? 
ALAN: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends. 
RACHEL: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
ROSS: Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
MONICA: Hi. 
ALL: Mmm. 
ROSS: So how'd it go? 
MONICA: Oh, y'know.. 
PHOEBE: Did he mention us? 
MONICA: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. 
ROSS: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. 
CHANDLER: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
ALL: No no no! 
CHANDLER: I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 
PHOEBE: If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, alright. 
MONICA: Alright. Phoebe? 
PHOEBE: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! 
ROSS: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? 
CHANDLER: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. 
RACHEL: See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." 
ALL: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. 
MONICA: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? 
JOEY: Probably kill myself! 
MONICA: ..Excuse me? 
JOEY: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! 
ROSS: Joey, uh- OMnipotent. 
JOEY: You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. 
MONICA: How does she do that? 
ROSS: I cannot sleep in a public place. 
MONICA: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. 
PHOEBE: Oh! What what what! ...Hi. 
ROSS: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. 
MONICA: What's going on with you? 
PHOEBE: I got no sleep last night! 
ROSS: Why? 
PHOEBE: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! 
MONICA: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. 
PHOEBE: Thanks. 
JOEY: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
CHANDLER: You got waaaay too much free time. 
JOEY: Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you. 
CHANDLER: Happy birthday, pal! 
JOEY: We love you, man. 
ROSS: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. 
JOEY: So? 
ROSS: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
CHANDLER: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty". 
ROSS: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth? 
MONICA: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. 
ROSS: Ohhh. 
JOEY: What's wrong with the twentieth? 
CHANDLER: Eleven days before Hallowe'en.. all the good costumes are gone? 
ROSS: Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. 
JOEY: The hell with hockey, let's all do that! 
CHANDLER: C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, huh? huh? huh? 
ROSS: What are you doing? 
CHANDLER: I have no idea. 
JOEY: C'mon, Ross! 
ROSS: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
CHANDLER: You got it. 
RACHEL: Look look look look look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! 
PHOEBE: I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. 
MONICA: Wow, you worked in a mine? 
PHOEBE: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? 
RACHEL: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally- -not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that. 
CHANDLER: Oh, this is not that bad. 
JOEY: Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. 
ROSS: You can totally, totally live on this. 
MONICA: Yeah, yeah. 
ROSS: Oh, by the way, great service tonight. 
ALL: Oh! Yeah! 
BOYS: Hockey! Hockey! Hockey. 
LESLIE: Rachel? 
RACHEL: Oh my God! 
MONICA: I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom. 
RACHEL: What are you guys doing here? 
KIKI: Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true! 
JOANNE: Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play. 
RACHEL: LESLIE) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it! 
LESLIE: I know. I know! I'm a duplex. 
RACHEL: So what's going on with you? 
JOANNE: Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? 
KIKI: And while we're on the subject of news.. 
PHOEBE: Look, look, I have elbows! 
CHANDLER: ...Poulet passes it up to Leech! 
JOEY: Leech spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! 
CHANDLER: We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes. 
ROSS: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry. 
JOEY: What? 
ROSS: Peach pit. 
CHANDLER: Yes, Bunny? 
ROSS: Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had- 
JOEY: -Peaches? 
ROSS: Actually, nectarines, but basically.. 
CHANDLER: Could've been a peach. 
ROSS: Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine. 
JOEY: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. 
RACHEL: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! 
KIKI: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! 
JOANNE: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
RACHEL: Okay. 
JOANNE: When are you coming home? 
RACHEL: What? Guys, I'm not. 
JOANNE: C'mon, this is us. 
RACHEL: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job- 
KIKI: Waitressing? 
RACHEL: Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. 
LESLIE: Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies. 
MONICA: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? 
RACHEL: What's that? 
MONICA: Weeeell, it's rum, and- 
RACHEL: Okay. 
MONICA: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. 
PHOEBE: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! 
MONICA: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people. 
RACHEL: Oh, God, ask them what they want. 
MONICA: Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account. 
RACHEL: But I haven't used my card in weeks! 
MONICA: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. 
RACHEL: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay? 
MONICA: Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back? 
RACHEL: Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister! 
ROSS: Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh. 
CHANDLER: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? 
ROSS: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost... 
JOEY: C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. 
MONICA: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing! 
RACHEL: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what? 
PHOEBE: You are just like Jack. 
RACHEL: ...Jack from downstairs? 
PHOEBE: No, Jack and the Beanstalk. 
MONICA: Ah, the other Jack. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.. 
RACHEL: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- 
PHOEBE: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. 
RACHEL: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like- 
PHOEBE: Floopy? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
MONICA: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. 
PHOEBE: Oh, like that's a word. 
RACHEL: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? 
MONICA: ...Pheebs? 
PHOEBE: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question. 
RACHEL: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? 
ROSS: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! 
CHANDLER: See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. 
ROSS: Pass it! Pass it! 
CHANDLER: He's open! 
ALL: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! 
CHANDLER: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing! 
CHANDLER: 'Scuse me. 
RECEPTIONIST: It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied. 
CHANDLER: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. 
RECEPTIONIST: Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there. 
ROSS: Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. 
RECEPTIONIST: Well, you'll have to wait your turn. 
JOEY: Well, how long do you think it'll be? 
RECEPTIONIST: Any minute now. 
ROSS: Hey, this- Heyy... 
RACHEL: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. 
MONICA: No, you were right. I don't have a plan. 
PIZZA GUY : Pizza guy. 
RACHEL: Thank God. Food. 
MONICA: Phoebe? 
PHOEBE: What? 
MONICA: Do you have a plan? 
PHOEBE: I don't even have a 'pl'. 
PIZZA GUY: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion? 
RACHEL: No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. 
PIZZA GUY: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos'? Man, my dad's gonna kill me! 
MONICA: Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos'? 
PIZZA GUY: Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead! 
MONICA: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? 
PIZZA GUY: Yeah, that sounds about right. 
MONICA: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? 
PHOEBE: And-and a power tie? 
PIZZA GUY: No, pretty much just a towel. 
MONICA: Oh God. 
PIZZA GUY: So you guys want me to take this back? 
MONICA: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! 
RACHEL: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? 
PHOEBE: Big Bird's friend. 
MONICA: I see pizza! 
PHOEBE: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! 
RACHEL: Hello? Who are we spying on? 
MONICA: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? 
RACHEL: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! 
PHOEBE: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. 
MONICA: Please tell me it's his mother. 
PHOEBE: Definitely not his mother. 
MONICA: Oh, no... 
PHOEBE: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch! 
CHANDLER: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? 
CHANDLER: Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-! 
MONICA: Light still out? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
MONICA: Oh. Maybe they're- napping. 
RACHEL: Oh please, they're having sex. 
MONICA+PHOEBE: Shut up! 
RACHEL: So, whaddya think George is like? 
MONICA: I think he's shy. 
PHOEBE: Yeah? 
MONICA: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. 
ROSS: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
CHANDLER: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? 
JOEY: He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. 
ROSS: Look, it's just a little more complicated... 
CHANDLER: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? 
ROSS: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 
CHANDLER: Then what? 
ROSS: My first time with Carol was.. 
JOEY: What? 
ROSS: It was my first time. 
JOEY: With Carol? 
JOEY: Oh. 
CHANDLER: So in your whole life, you've only been with one- -oh. 
JOEY: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! 
MONICA: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? 
PHOEBE: Uh-huh. 
MONICA: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah! 
PHOEBE: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. 
MONICA: What?! You slept with Jason? 
PHOEBE: You'd already broken up. 
RACHEL: How long? 
PHOEBE: A couple hours. 
MONICA: Oh, that's nice! 
RACHEL: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. 
MONICA: Excuse me?! 
RACHEL: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl. 
MONICA: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade! 
RACHEL: I was laughing! You made me laugh! 
PHOEBE: There he is! There he is! 
MONICA: Where? 
PHOEBE: Right- where we've been looking all night! 
RACHEL: He is so cute! 
MONICA: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! 
ALL: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the- -wowww. 
JOEY: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? 
CHANDLER: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic.. 
JOEY: Really? 
CHANDLER: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. 
BOTH: Hey, buddy. 
ROSS: Hi. 
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, that's attractive. 
CHANDLER: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight. 
ROSS: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? 
JOEY: Oh, ah- the kid has it. 
ROSS: The kid..? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck. 
KID: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. 
CHANDLER: You gotta do it, man. 
ROSS: Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever- -can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck. 
KID: No. 
ROSS: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme! 
KID: No! No! 
RECEPTIONIST: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER! 
ROSS: GIVE ME MY PUCK!! 
ROSS: ...Now that was fun. 
ROSS: Okay, Monica: Right foot red. 
MONICA: Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo. 
CHANDLER: Thanks. 
ROSS: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. 
CHANDLER: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people. 
RACHEL: Oh, okay. Will you take my place? 
CHANDLER: Alright. Yes, this is Rachel. 
RACHEL: Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. 
ROSS: Green. To the green. 
RACHEL: I've got magic beans. Never-never mind. 
CHANDLER: To the left, to the left- aww! 
RACHEL: Ohhh... I'm fine. 
RACHEL: Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting! 
CHANDLER: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom... 
PHOEBE: The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud! 
ROSS: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen. 
JOEY: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. 
RACHEL: God. I feel violated. 
MONICA: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? 
CHANDLER: Ross, ten o'clock. 
ROSS: Is it? Feels like two. 
CHANDLER: No, ten o'clock. 
ROSS: What? 
CHANDLER: There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! 
ROSS: Oh. Hel-lo! 
CHANDLER: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men! 
MONICA: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone. 
CHANDLER: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.' 
RACHEL: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it! 
CHANDLER: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here. 
ROSS: He could never get a woman like that in a million years. 
CHANDLER: Thank you, buddy. 
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys. 
MONICA: You could do that! 
CHANDLER: Y'think? 
ALL: Yeah! 
CHANDLER: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue... 
ROSS: C'mon! C'mon! 
CHANDLER: Here goes. 
AURORA: ...Yes? 
CHANDLER: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi. 
AURORA: Yes, you said that. 
CHANDLER: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. 
AURORA: Chandler? 
ALL: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard! 
JOEY: Whadja think? 
ALL: ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard! 
JOEY: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head. 
ALL: Saw your head. Saw your head. 
CHANDLER: She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. 
RACHEL: What is it? 
JOEY: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me! 
PHOEBE: Based on this play? ...Based on this play! 
CHANDLER: Hey, kids. 
ALL: Hey. 
PHOEBE: No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line. 
CHANDLER: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went. 
MONICA: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'? 
CHANDLER: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army... 
AURORA: ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. 
CHANDLER: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. 
CHANDLER: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less. 
AURORA: ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yemen. 
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is? 
AURORA: 'We' would be me and Rick. 
JOEY: Who's Rick? 
CHANDLER: Who's Rick? 
AURORA: My husband. 
ALL: Ooooohhh. 
CHANDLER: Oh, so you're divorced? 
AURORA: No. 
CHANDLER: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully? 
AURORA: No, I'm still married. 
CHANDLER: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket? 
AURORA: Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan. 
CHANDLER: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan? 
AURORA: Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend. 
ALL: What?! 
CHANDLER: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend? 
AURORA: I suppose mainly sexual. 
CHANDLER: ...Hm. 
MONICA: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out. 
CHANDLER: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story? 
MONICA: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this? 
CHANDLER: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy! 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy? 
ROSS: No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is. 
MONICA: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else? 
JOEY: I couldn't do it. 
MONICA: Good for you, Joey. 
JOEY: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. 
ROSS: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- 
ROSS: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. 
MONICA: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! 
ALL: Yeah! C'mon! 
ROSS: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey- 
RACHEL: Tah-daaah! 
CHANDLER: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that. 
RACHEL: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for. 
ROSS: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask. 
RACHEL: Well, whaddya think? 
ALL: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific! 
MONICA: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman. 
ALL: Uh-oh... 
MONICA: How-how did that happen? 
RACHEL: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table. 
MONICA: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while. 
PHOEBE: I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. 
CHANDLER: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out. 
MONICA: You guys, I am not that bad! 
PHOEBE: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! 
MONICA: That is so unfair! 
ROSS: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy! 
MONICA: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook. 
ROSS: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away. 
MONICA: Why not? 
ROSS: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice. 
MONICA: I could do that. 
RACHEL: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout. 
MONICA: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder. 
CHANDLER: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood... 
MONICA: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I? 
ROSS: Monica? You're Mom. 
PHOEBE: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! 
JOEY: Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job- in the new Al Pacino movie! 
ALL: Oh my God! Whoah! 
MONICA: Well, what's the part? 
JOEY: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!' 
PHOEBE: Seriously, what-what's the part? 
JOEY: 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!' 
ROSS: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part? 
JOEY: ...I'm his 
RACHEL: ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what? 
JOEY: ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. 
MONICA: Oh my God. 
JOEY: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! 
CHANDLER: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness. 
JOEY: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! 
ROSS: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? 
MONICA: Alright, alright, alright... 
JOEY: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer. 
MONICA: For what? 
JOEY: Whaddya think? Today's the big day! 
MONICA: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there. 
JOEY: Thank you! 
CHANDLER: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone. 
MONICA: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there! 
CHANDLER: C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!! 
MONICA: I warned you... 
RACHEL: Who is being loud? 
CHANDLER: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast. 
MONICA: Oh, you got the whole night, huh? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. 
RACHEL: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment? 
CHANDLER: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? 
MONICA: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. 
DIRECTOR: ...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready? 
JOEY: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. 
DIRECTOR: Lose the robe. 
JOEY: Me? 
DIRECTOR: That would work. 
JOEY: Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost. 
DIRECTOR: Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action. 
DIRECTOR: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing? 
JOEY: Well, I'm- I'm showering. 
DIRECTOR: No, that was clenching. 
JOEY: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here. 
DIRECTOR: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that? 
JOEY: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... 
CHANDLER: God, I love these fingers... 
AURORA: Thank you. 
CHANDLER: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are. 
AURORA: Oh my God, I'm late. 
CHANDLER: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. 
AURORA: Okay. 
CHANDLER: Don't go. 
AURORA: Okay. Oh no, I have to. 
CHANDLER: Too bad, she's leaving. 
AURORA: I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me. 
CHANDLER: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick. 
AURORA: It's not Rick. 
CHANDLER: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you! 
AURORA: No, it's-it's Andrew. 
CHANDLER: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is? 
AURORA: He's... new. 
CHANDLER: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? 
AURORA: No, that's not exactly what I was.. 
CHANDLER: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us. 
AURORA: So what do you want? 
CHANDLER: You. 
AURORA: You have me! 
CHANDLER: Nono, just you. 
AURORA: Whaddyou mean? 
CHANDLER: Lose the other guys. 
AURORA: ...Like, ...all of them? 
CHANDLER: C'mon, we're great together, why not? 
AURORA: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too. 
CHANDLER: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!' 
AURORA: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to? 
CHANDLER: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish... 
AURORA: Which one? 
CHANDLER: ...The second guy. 
AURORA: Well, call me if you change your mind. 
CHANDLER: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips. 
ROSS: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again? 
ALL: Hey! 
MONICA: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie? 
JOEY: Nope. 
ROSS: No? What happened, big guy? 
CHANDLER: 'Big guy'? 
ROSS: It felt like a 'big guy' moment. 
JOEY: I got fired. 
ALL: Oh! 
JOEY: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and- 
RACHEL: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell. 
JOEY: My mom will. 
CHANDLER: Something so sweet and... disturbing about that. 
JOEY: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it! 
MONICA: Maybe this wasn't your shot. 
ROSS: Yeah, I mean- I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it- feel like your shot..? 
JOEY: Hard to tell, I was naked. 
PHOEBE: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'. 
JOEY: Yeah? That's so nice! 
MONICA: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. 
ALL: Night. 
RACHEL: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here? 
MONICA: Uh-huh! 
RACHEL: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner? 
MONICA: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. 
ROSS: She is a kook. 
MONICA: If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! 
RACHEL: Everybody. Shh, shhh. Err, Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay. 
ROSS: Alright!!!!

ROSS: Step back! 
JOEY: We have a winner! 
RACHEL: Huh, I`ve just never. . . had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where, where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park. 
ROSS: Well it was the only thing to do there, that didn`t have a line. 
RACHEL: Alright well, see, I mean, Barry wouldn`t even kiss me on a minature golf course. 
ROSS: Come on. 
RACHEL: No..he said we were holding up the people behind us. 
ROSS: And you didn`t marry him be-cause? 
RACHEL: I mean d`you think. there are people that go through life never having that kind of. 
ROSS: Probably. 
RACHEL: Really? 
ROSS: But, but, you know I`ll tell you something, passion is way over rated. 
RACHEL: Yeah, right! 
ROSS: It is, er eventually it kinds of burns out, but hopefully what you are left with is trust and security and er, well in the case of my ex-wife. . . . .lesbianism! So you know for all those people who miss out on that er, passion thing, there`s all that other good stuff. 
RACHEL: Ok. 
ROSS: But er, I don`t think that`s gonna be you. . . .

PHOEBE: Ya know, did you rent mopeds..because I`ve heard.. Oh It`s not about that right now, ok. 
RACHEL: Oh, God, you know, I know It`s totally superfical, and we have nothing in common, and we don`t even speak the same language, but Gohohohodddddd.

CHANDLER: Yes! Yes! Thanks for er, letting me use your phone er, and for saving my life. 
JILL: Well, goodbye, Chandler, I had a great blackout. See ya! 
CHANDLER: Hi, erm, I`m account number 7143457 and er, I don`t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. 
SHELLEY: Hey gorgeous, how's it going? 
CHANDLER: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this? 
SHELLEY: Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. 
CHANDLER: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'... 
SHELLEY: Do you want a date Saturday? 
CHANDLER: Yes please. 
SHELLEY: Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's- 
CHANDLER: He's a he? 
SHELLEY: Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now- -okay, goodbye... 
CHANDLER: ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that? 
RACHEL: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... 
CHANDLER: You did? 
RACHEL: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not. 
CHANDLER: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me? 
MONICA: I did. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, I think so, yeah. 
JOEY: Not me. 
ROSS: No no, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did. 
CHANDLER: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't? 
ROSS: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so... 
CHANDLER: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me? 
PHOEBE: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny... 
CHANDLER: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him? 
ALL: Yeah! Right! 
CHANDLER: WHAT IS IT?! 
MONICA: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality. 
ALL: Yes. Absolutely. A quality. 
CHANDLER: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this. 
MONICA: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. 
RACHEL: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio. 
ROSS: So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome. 
RACHEL: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome. 
MONICA: Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. 
ROSS: So, uh, how's she doing? 
AUNT LILLIAN: The doctor says it's a matter of hours. 
MONICA: How-how are you, Mom? 
MRS. GELLER: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair? 
MONICA: What? 
MRS. GELLER: What's different? 
MONICA: Nothing. 
MRS. GELLER: Oh, maybe that's it. 
MONICA: She is unbelievable, our mother is... 
ROSS: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. 
MONICA: Oh God! 
MONICA: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
ROSS: Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants. 
MR. GELLER: Not just restaurants, from our house. 
NURSE: Mrs. Geller? 
ROSS: She looks so small. 
MONICA: I know. 
ROSS: Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. 
MONICA: G'bye, Nana. 
ROSS: Bye, Nana. 
MONICA: Ross! 
MRS. GELLER: What is going on?! 
ROSS: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.. 
MRS. GELLER: What? 
ROSS: She's not- past, she's present, she's back. 
AUNT LILLIAN: What's going on? 
MR. GELLER: She may have died. 
AUNT LILLIAN: She may have died? 
MR. GELLER: We're looking into it. 
ROSS: I, uh, I'll go see. 
NURSE: This almost never happens! 
ROSS: Now she's passed. 
CHANDLER: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair? 
RACHEL: Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, you have homosexual hair. 
RACHEL: So, um, did she... 
ROSS: Twice. 
JOEY: Twice? 
PHOEBE: Oh, that sucks! 
JOEY: You guys okay? 
ROSS: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh... 
PHOEBE: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone. 
ROSS: Nono, she's gone. 
MONICA: We checked. A lot. 
PHOEBE: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her. 
RACHEL: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? 
PHOEBE: Thanks! 
RACHEL: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. 
JOEY: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh? 
PHOEBE: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. 
ROSS: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket. 
MRS. GELLER: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice! 
MRS. GELLER: Sweetie, you think you can get in there? 
ROSS: I don't see why not. 
ROSS: Here's my retainer! 
MR. GELLER: I was just thinking. When my time comes- 
MONICA: Dad! 
MR. GELLER: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea. 
MONICA: You what? 
MR. GELLER: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. 
MONICA: Define fun. 
MR. GELLER: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch... 
MONICA: ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun. 
MR. GELLER: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'. 
MONICA: That's probably what they'll say. 
MR. GELLER: I'd like that. 
CHANDLER: Hey, gorgeous. 
SHELLEY: Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um- 
CHANDLER: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake. 
SHELLEY: Oh! Okay! Phew! 
CHANDLER: So, uh... what do you think it is about me? 
SHELLEY: I dunno, uh... you just have a-a... 
CHANDLER: ...Quality, right, great. 
SHELLEY: Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple. 
CHANDLER: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with? 
SHELLEY: What? He's cute! 
CHANDLER: Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll. 
SHELLEY: Is Brian...? 
CHANDLER: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him. 
SHELLEY: Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league. 
CHANDLER: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not. 
ROSS: This one? 
AUNT LILLIAN: No. 
ROSS: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy. 
AUNT LILLIAN: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one. 
MRS. GELLER: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. 
ROSS: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. 
AUNT LILLIAN: Wait! We need shoes! 
ROSS: Okay. Um, how about these? 
MRS. GELLER: That's really a day shoe. 
ROSS: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier? 
AUNT LILLIAN: Could we see something in a slimmer heel? 
ROSS: Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. 
AUNT LILLIAN: No, it really should be burgundy. 
MRS. GELLER: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? 
ROSS: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. 
ROSS: Oh my God.. 
MRS. GELLER: Is everything all right, dear? 
ROSS: Yeah, just... just Nana stuff. 
ROSS: How we doing, you guys ready? 
MONICA: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? 
ROSS: Some days it's all I can think about. 
PHOEBE: Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings. 
RACHEL: Oh, you-you mean your earrings? 
PHOEBE: What'd I say? 
RACHEL: Hm-m. 
MONICA: Are these the shoes? 
RACHEL: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy. 
ROSS: What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...? 
JOEY: Morning. We ready to go? 
CHANDLER: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it? 
MONICA: It was a really beautiful service. 
MRS. GELLER: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream. 
JOEY: What? 
CHANDLER: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger. 
JOEY: Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. 
CHANDLER: You're watching a football game at a funeral? 
JOEY: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception. 
CHANDLER: You are a frightening, frightening man. 
RACHEL: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! 
ROSS: Oh, I hope they're not ruined. 
PHOEBE: God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise! 
ROSS: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- 
ALL: God! Ross! 
ROSS: I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised... 
PHOEBE: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh. 
ROSS: What, what is it? 
PHOEBE: You missed a belt loop. 
ROSS: Oh! No-n- 
PHOEBE: Okay, it's in spasm. 
MRS. GELLER: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. 
CHANDLER: Oh, no- 
ANDREA: Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter. 
CHANDLER: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. 
PHOEBE: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel? 
ROSS: I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great. 
MONICA: Wow, those pills really worked, huh? 
ROSS: Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs.. 
PHOEBE: Ooh! That's so nice... 
ROSS: ...Chandler! 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
ROSS: And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me. 
ANDREA: You were right. 
ROSS: Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most. 
RACHEL: Oh, well you know who I love the most? 
ROSS: No. 
RACHEL: You! 
ROSS: Oh.. you don't get it! 
MR. GELLER: Whaddya got there? 
JOEY: Just a, uh... hearing disability. 
MR. GELLER: What's the score? 
JOEY: Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third. 
MR. GELLER: Beautiful! 
RACHEL: Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? 
MRS. GELLER: Your grandmother would have hated this. 
MONICA: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. 
MRS. GELLER: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'. 
MONICA: That sounds like Nana. 
MRS. GELLER: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? 
MONICA: ...I can imagine. 
MRS. GELLER: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is. 
MONICA: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her? 
MRS. GELLER: Tell her what? 
MONICA: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. 
MRS. GELLER: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. 
MONICA: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth? 
MRS. GELLER: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. 
MONICA: Huh. 
MRS. GELLER: More wine, dear? 
MONICA: Oh, I think so. 
MRS. GELLER: Those earrings look really lovely on you. 
MONICA: Thank you. They're yours. 
MRS. GELLER: Actually they were Nana's. 
MR. GELLER: Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was. 
RACHEL: Hey, who's this little naked guy? 
ROSS: That little naked guy would be me. 
RACHEL: Aww, look at the little thing. 
ROSS: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now? 
CHANDLER: Who are those people? 
ROSS: Got me. 
MONICA: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. 
RACHEL: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? 
MONICA: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? 
ROSS: Looks like a fun gang. 
JOEY: Ooh, look look look look look! I got Monica naked! 
ROSS: Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. 
CHANDLER: Hey, Lowell. 
LOWELL: Hey, Chandler. 
CHANDLER: So how's it going there in Financial Services? 
LOWELL: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you? 
CHANDLER: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not. 
LOWELL: I know. That's what I told her. 
CHANDLER: Really. 
LOWELL: Yeah. 
CHANDLER: So- you can tell? 
LOWELL: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar. 
CHANDLER: So you don't think I have a, a quality? 
LOWELL: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. 
CHANDLER: He is? 
LOWELL: Yup, and waaay out of your league. 
CHANDLER: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian. 
 RACHEL: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got $100 advance in my salary? 
TERRY: An advance? 
RACHEL: It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job. 
TERRY: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. 
RACHEL: Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that. 
RACHEL: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips? 
GUY: Huh? 
RACHEL: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go. 
MONICA: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? 
ROSS: No, they're not. 
MONICA: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. 
ROSS: You're wrong. 
MONICA: I am not wrong. 
ROSS: You're wrong. 
MONICA: No, I just talked to them. 
ROSS: I'm calling Mom. 
JOEY: Hey, hey. 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
CHANDLER: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup? 
JOEY: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model. 
CHANDLER: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman. 
PHOEBE: What were you modeling for? 
JOEY: You know those posters for the city free clinic? 
MONICA: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"? 
PHOEBE: You know, the asthma guy was really cute. 
CHANDLER: Do you know which one you're gonna be? 
JOEY: No, I hear lyme disease is open, so... 
CHANDLER: Good luck, man. I hope you get it. 
JOEY: Thanks. 
ROSS: Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. 
MONICA: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. 
ROSS: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? 
MONICA: You know, they're not actually supposed to have...I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right? 
JOEY: Yeah. 
MONICA: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. 
CHANDLER: Yes, every single one of them. 
MONICA: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma? 
PHOEBE: Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar. 
MONICA: So you're free Thursday, then. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. Oh, can I come? 
MONICA: Yeah. Rache, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail? 
RACHEL: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go. 
CHANDLER: I thought it was $98.50. 
RACHEL: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. 
ROSS: Well, I'm off to Carol's. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her? 
ROSS: Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. 
ROSS: Hi, is uh, is Carol here? 
SUSAN: No, she's at a faculty meeting. 
ROSS: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull, well, not mine, but... SUSAN: Come in. 
ROSS: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. 
SUSAN: What's it look like? 
ROSS: Kinda like a big face without skin. 
SUSAN: Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. 
ROSS: Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. 
SUSAN: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it. 
ROSS: Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. 
SUSAN: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. 
ROSS: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're crazy? 
SUSAN: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there? 
ROSS: You're not serious, I mean, you really, you really talk to it? 
SUSAN: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. 
ROSS: Do you uh, do you talk about me? 
SUSAN: Yeah, yeah, all the time. 
ROSS: Really? 
SUSAN: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. 
ROSS: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this. 
PHOEBE: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally believe everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. 
CHANDLER: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head. 
MONICA: Hey, Rache, did you make your money? 
RACHEL: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop. 
MONICA: Rache, here's your mail. 
RACHEL: Thanks, you can just put it on the table. 
MONICA: No, here's your mail. 
RACHEL: Thanks, you can just put it on the table. 
MONICA: Would you just open it? 
RACHEL: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great. 
MONICA: We all chipped in. 
JOEY: We did? 
MONICA: You owe me 20 bucks. 
RACHEL: Thank you. Thank you so much! 
MONICA: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. 
RACHEL: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? 
CHANDLER: All right, I'm nine years old. 
ROSS: Oh, I hate this story. 
CHANDLER: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have, and I remember this part vividly, a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. 
RACHEL: Oh my god. 
CHANDLER: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. 
JOEY: Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together. 
GIRL: We did? 
JOEY: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis? 
GIRL: Yeah, right. 
JOEY: I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business. 
GIRL: Get out. 
JOEY: I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back. 
GIRL: Really? You don't know what that means to me. 
JOEY: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing? 
GIRL: Nothing. 
JOEY: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something? 
GIRL: Yeah. Oh. 
JOEY: What's wrong? 
GIRL: I just remembered, I have to do something. 
JOEY: Oh. What? 
GIRL: Um, leave. 
JOEY: Wait, wait, wait! 
JOEY: So I guess you all saw it. 
RACHEL: Saw what? 
PHOEBE: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious. 
JOEY: Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. 
CHANDLER: Tonight, on a very special Blossom. 
MONICA: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What? 
ROSS: I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. 
MONICA: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. 
ROSS: That's closer. 
RACHEL: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. 
CHANDLER: Oh, you must stop shooping. 
RACHEL: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff. 
JOEY: Chandler, will you just come in already? 
CHANDLER: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. 
PHOEBE: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie! 
CHANDLER: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. 
JOEY: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots. 
MONICA: That's not a question. 
JOEY: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease. 
MONICA: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. 
ROSS: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. 
MONICA: Ah! 
ROSS: Ok, Mom never hit. 
PHOEBE: Ok, all done. 
MONICA: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes--Ross needs lumps! 
PHOEBE: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. 
MONICA: Why would we do that? 
PHOEBE: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. 
MONICA: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. 
RACHEL: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! 
CHANDLER: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. 
JOEY: The balloon? 
CHANDLER: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? 
RACHEL: I can't, I gotta go. 
CHANDLER: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen? 
PHOEBE: Almost never. 
MONICA: Got the keys? 
RACHEL: Ok. 
CAROL: Anytime you're ready. 
ROSS: Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... 
CAROL: Just aim for the bump. 
ROSS: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid. 
CAROL: So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it. 
ROSS: Hello, baby. Hello, hello. 
RACHEL: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean. 
MONICA: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here? 
RACHEL: We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys. 
MONICA: No I don't. 
RACHEL: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys." 
MONICA: No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?" 
RACHEL: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys". 
CHANDLER: Do either of you have the keys? 
MONICA: The oven is on. 
RACHEL: Oh, I gotta get my ticket! 
JOEY: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. 
MONICA: Well then get it, get it! 
JOEY: That tone will not make me go any faster. 
MONICA: Joey! 
JOEY: That one will. 
ROSS: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore. 
CAROL: Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want. 
ROSS: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok? 
SUSAN: Hi, how's it goin? 
ROSS: Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that? 
CAROL: I did. 
ROSS: Does it always, uh--? 
CAROL: No, no that was the first. 
SUSAN: Keep singing! Keep singing! 
ROSS: Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. 
SUSAN: I felt it! 
ROSS: Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts. 
JOEY: Nope, not that one. 
MONICA: Can you go any faster with that? 
JOEY: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math. 
MONICA: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? 
CHANDLER: For an emergency just like this. 
RACHEL: All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not. 
MONICA: I swear you said you had the keys. 
RACHEL: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys. 
MONICA: Why would I have the keys? 
RACHEL: Aside from the fact that you said you had them? 
MONICA: But I didn't. 
RACHEL: Well, you should have. 
MONICA: Why? 
RACHEL: Because! 
MONICA: Why? 
RACHEL: Because! 
MONICA: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... 
CHANDLER: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go. 
MONICA: Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. 
ROSS: Here we come, walkin' down the--this doesn't smell like Mom's. 
MONICA: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one. 
RACHEL: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys. 
JOEY: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice. 
MONICA: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner? 
JOEY: You call that delicious? 
MONICA: Stop it, stop it, stop it! 
CHANDLER: Now this feels like Thanksgiving. 
PHOEBE: Ooh. 
RACHEL: What? 
PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal. 
JOEY: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy! 
MONICA: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing! 
PHOEBE: It's nice that he has someone. 
CHANDLER: Shall I carve? 
RACHEL: By all means. 
CHANDLER: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? 
ROSS: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese. 
MONICA: Does anybody wanna split this with me? 
JOEY: Oh, I will. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish. 
MONICA: Make a wish? 
PHOEBE: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for? 
JOEY: The bigger half. 
CHANDLER: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. 
ALL: That's so sweet. 
ROSS: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. 
RACHEL: And a crappy New Year. 
CHANDLER: Here, here! 
ROSS: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
ALL: Oooh! 
MONICA: W-wait. What is that? 
ROSS: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? 
MONICA: No, no, I don't. 
RACHEL: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? 
ROSS: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. 
PHOEBE: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? 
CHANDLER: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass! 
MONICA: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment? 
ROSS: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so... 
MONICA: Why don't you just get a roommate? 
ROSS: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. 
PHOEBE: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. 
CHANDLER: Might wanna open with the snowman. 
ALL: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy. 
MONICA: So, how'd it go? 
JOEY: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job. 
ROSS: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. 
JOEY: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. 
MONICA: So what are you gonna be? 
JOEY: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know? 
RACHEL: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? 
CHANDLER: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud! 
RACHEL: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, you wish! 
CHANDLER: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. 
ALL: Yeah, okay. Alright. 
CHANDLER: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
ALL: Woooo! Yeah! 
RACHEL: Phoebe, you're on. 
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, good. 
RACHEL: Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh! 
PHOEBE: Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. 
PHOEBE: 
PHOEBE: 
MAX: No. No, that's- that's okay. 
PHOEBE: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! 
CHANDLER: That guy's going home with a note! 
DAVID: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my- 
PHOEBE: Could you speak up please? 
DAVID: Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought 
MAX: Daryl Hannah. 
DAVID: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a... 
MAX: Hard quality. 
DAVID: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. 
PHOEBE: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. 
JOEY: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! 
ROSS: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. 
RACHEL: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much? 
ROSS: Just a smidge. 
PHOEBE: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical. 
MONICA: I think it's romantic. 
PHOEBE: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? 
RACHEL: Yeah! 
PHOEBE: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
CHANDLER: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact. 
PHOEBE: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice. 
MONICA: What?! 
ROSS: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
CHANDLER: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped. 
MONICA: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history! 
CHANDLER: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! 
JOEY: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. 
CHANDLER: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
JOEY: Nice shoes, huh? 
CHANDLER: Aah, y'killing me! 
MONICA: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! 
ROSS: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? 
MONICA: Do you always have to bring him here? 
ROSS: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... 
CHANDLER: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. 
ROSS: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. 
CHANDLER: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. 
DAVID: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. 
PHOEBE: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. 
DAVID: Yuh. 
PHOEBE: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? 
DAVID: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. 
PHOEBE: Sure. 
DAVID: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. 
PHOEBE: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body. 
DAVID: Rrrreally. 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. 
DAVID: ...Now? Now? 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, right now. 
DAVID: Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift. 
PHOEBE: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. 
DAVID: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop? 
PHOEBE: I can hop. 
ROSS: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you? 
MONICA: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. 
CHANDLER: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby? 
MONICA: Yeah. 
JOEY: You know more than one Fun Bobby? 
CHANDLER: I happen to know a Fun Bob. 
RACHEL: Okay, here we go... 
JOEY: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! 
RACHEL: There. Now there is. 
ROSS: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates. 
JOEY: Uh, four. 
ROSS: Four. 
RACHEL: Five. 
ROSS: Five. 
RACHEL: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. 
JOEY: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? 
ROSS: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? 
RACHEL: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who. 
ROSS: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now. 
MONICA: What's the matter? 
ROSS: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 
CHANDLER: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. 
ROSS: Really. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. 
ROSS: What, uh... what juggling thing? 
CHANDLER: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that. 
ROSS: No. 
CHANDLER: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon... 
MAX: Phoebe. Hi. 
PHOEBE: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? 
MAX: No. Have you seen David? 
PHOEBE: No, no, he hasn't been around. 
MAX: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk. 
PHOEBE: Minsk? 
MAX: Minsk. It's in Russia. 
PHOEBE: I know where Minsk is. 
MAX: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. 
PHOEBE: So when, when do you leave? 
MAX: January first. 
PHOEBE: Hello? 
DAVID: Hey! 
PHOEBE: Hi. 
DAVID: Hi! What-what're you doing here? 
PHOEBE: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting! 
MAX: It'd be even more exciting if we were going. 
PHOEBE: Oh, you're not going? Oh, why? 
MAX: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' 
DAVID: Thank you, Max. Thank you. 
PHOEBE: So-so you're really not going? 
DAVID: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide. 
PHOEBE: Oh don't do that. 
DAVID: Please. 
PHOEBE: Oh no no. 
DAVID: No, but I'm asking- 
PHOEBE: Oh, but I can't do that- 
DAVID: No, but I can't- 
PHOEBE: It's your thing, and- 
DAVID: -make the decision- 
PHOEBE: Okay, um, stay. 
DAVID: Stay. 
PHOEBE: Stay. 
PHOEBE: Getting so good at that! 
DAVID: It was Max's stuff. 
JANICE: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 
CHANDLER: You remember Janice. 
MONICA: Vividly. 
MONICA: Hi. 
SANDY: Hi, I'm Sandy. 
JOEY: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids. 
SANDY: Yeah. That's okay, right? 
ROSS: Par-tay! 
MONICA: That thing is not coming in here. 
ROSS: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home? 
MONICA: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table. 
ROSS: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... 
MONICA: Alright. Just keep him away from me. 
ROSS: Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. 
MONICA: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo? 
RACHEL: Rome. Jerk missed his flight. 
PHOEBE: And then... your face is bloated? 
RACHEL: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip? 
SANDY: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. 
JOEY: Wow, that's, uh, dirty. 
SANDY: Yeah. 
JOEY: Hey, kids... 
ROSS: Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. 
JANICE: There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! 
CHANDLER: But you found me! 
JANICE: Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera! 
CHANDLER: Kill me. Kill me now. 
MONICA: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby! 
FUN BOBBY: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am! 
JOEY: Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? 
FUN BOBBY: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again. 
JANICE: Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter. 
CHANDLER: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we- 
JANICE: Oh, no. Oh, no. 
CHANDLER: I'm sorry you misunderstood... 
JANICE: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. 
CHANDLER: Oh, will you give me the thing. 
PHOEBE: Hi, Max! 
MAX: Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you. 
DAVID: Wow. 
MAX: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year. 
PHOEBE: Are you alright? 
DAVID: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
PHOEBE: You're going to Minsk. 
DAVID: No, I'm... not going to Minsk. 
PHOEBE: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me. 
DAVID: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you. 
PHOEBE: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'. 
DAVID: Uh, ow. 
PHOEBE: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me. 
DAVID: I'll never forget you. 
PHOEBE: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy. 
DICK CLARK : Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square... 
JOEY: There y'go, kids. 
CHANDLER: And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight. 
JOEY: You seen Sandy? 
CHANDLER: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you. 
RACHEL: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. 
THE GANG : What? 
RACHEL: The bll is drrbing! 
DICK CLARK : In twenty seconds it'll be midnight... 
CHANDLER: And the moment of joy is upon us. 
JOEY: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out. 
PHOEBE: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that. 
MONICA: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby! 
CHANDLER: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. 
PHOEBE: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight. 
RACHEL: I can't kiss anyone. 
MONICA: So I'm kissing everyone? 
JOEY: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother. 
ROSS: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. 
CHANDLER: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me! 
JOEY: Alrightalrightalright. There. 
ROSS: I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back. 
RACHEL: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth. 
 [PRE-INTRO SCENE: Monica and Phoebe are walking to a newsstand 
PHOEBE: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news? 
MONICA: Why? 
PHOEBE: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right. 
MONICA: Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. 
PHOEBE: Where? Ooh, come to Momma. 
MONICA: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. 
GUY: Nice hat. 
MONICA AND PHOEBE : Thanks. 
PHOEBE: We should do something. Whistle. 
MONICA: We are not going to whistle. 
PHOEBE: Come on, do it. 
MONICA: No! 
PHOEBE: Do it! 
MONICA: No! 
PHOEBE: Do it do it do it! 
MONICA: Woo-woo! 
PHOEBE: I can't believe you did that! 
MONICA: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'? 
PHOEBE: I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP! 
MONICA: Phoebe, what are you doing? 
PHOEBE: Maybe nobody's tried this. 
MONICA: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic. 
MONICA: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance! 
PHOEBE: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked. 
MONICA: I wish all guys could be like him. 
PHOEBE: I know. 
CHANDLER: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? 
MONICA: He doesn't have anyone. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible. 
JOEY: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo. 
RACHEL: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! 
JAY LENO : Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one. 
CHANDLER: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime, HBL and Cinemax. 
RACHEL: No way, forget it. 
JOEY: C'mon, she's your mom! 
CHANDLER: Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No? 
RACHEL: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool! 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch'. 
ROSS: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. 
CHANDLER: You can say that because she's not your mom. 
ROSS: Oh, please.. 
PAOLO: Bona sera. 
RACHEL: Oh, hi sweetie. 
ROSS: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome? 
MONICA: Last night. 
ROSS: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew. 
PHOEBE: Hey hey hey! She's on! 
PAOLO: Ah! Nora Bing! 
JAY LENO : ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about? 
PHOEBE: Your mom was arrested? 
CHANDLER: Shhh, busy beaming with pride. 
MRS. BING : ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man... 
CHANDLER: Now why would she say that's embarrassing? 
ALL: Shhh. 
MRS. BING : ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken. 
CHANDLER: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!! 
JAY LENO :: Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going? 
MRS. BING : Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love... 
ALL: Awww! 
CHANDLER: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone. 
JAY LENO :: Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad... 
MRS. BING : Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms. 
CHANDLER: ...And then he burst into flames. 
MONICA: Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports. 
PHOEBE: What about Glen? He could be a Glen. 
MONICA: Nah... not-not special enough. 
PHOEBE: Ooh! How about Agamemnon? 
MONICA: Waaay too special. 
MRS. BING: I am famished. What do I want... 
CHANDLER: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken. 
MRS. BING: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think? 
CHANDLER: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little. 
ROSS: What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place. 
MRS. BING: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila. 
CHANDLER: I know I am. 
MRS. BING: Who's doing shots? 
MONICA: Yeah. 
PHOEBE: I'm in. 
MRS. BING: There y'go. Ross? 
ROSS: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. 
RACHEL: Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time. 
ROSS: ...But a man can change. 
ROSS: Anyone want me to appraise anything? 
RACHEL: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer. 
MRS. BING: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book. 
CHANDLER: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. 
MRS. BING: Yeah, any messages for room 226? 
MRS. BING: You okay there, slugger? 
ROSS: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
MRS. BING: What is with you tonight? 
ROSS: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. 
MRS. BING: Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it. 
ROSS: No. It's the one he's licking. 
MRS. BING: She's supposed to be with you. 
ROSS: You're good. 
MRS. BING: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why? 
ROSS: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing? 
MRS. BING: No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off. 
ROSS: When? 
MRS. BING: He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is. 
ROSS: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing? 
MRS. BING: No, it's you! 
ROSS: Please. 
MRS. BING: No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy... 
ROSS: Right. 
MRS. BING: You are gonna be fine, believe me. 
ROSS: Uh-oh... 
JOEY: Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street. 
ROSS: Hey, is Chandler here? 
JOEY: Yeah. 
ROSS: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right? 
JOEY: Right. No big deal. 
ROSS: Okay. 
JOEY: In Bizarro World!! You broke the code! 
ROSS: What code? 
JOEY: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom! 
CHANDLER: What are you guys doing out here? 
ROSS: Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept. 
JOEY: Yeah, well, you don't have your racket. 
ROSS: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one. 
JOEY: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size. 
CHANDLER: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. 
ROSS: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum. 
JOEY: Ross, how could you let this happen? 
ROSS: I don't know, God, I- well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's- 
JOEY: You don't think my mom's sexy? 
ROSS: Well- not in the same way... 
JOEY: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? 
ROSS: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here... 
RACHEL: Hey. 
ROSS: Hey. 
RACHEL: What're you guys doing out here? 
ROSS: Well, not playing raquetball! 
JOEY: He forgot to leave his grip size! 
ROSS: He didn't get the goggles! 
RACHEL: Well,sounds like you two have issues. 
RACHEL: Goodbye, baby. 
PAOLO: Ciao, bela. 
ROSS: Do they wait for me to do this? 
JOEY: So are you gonna tell him? 
ROSS: Why would I tell him? 
JOEY: How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. 
ROSS: Oh... 
MONICA: What are you guys doing here? 
JOEY: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap! 
MONICA: ...What did I ask? 
MONICA: Hi. 
PHOEBE: Hi. 
MONICA: What are you doing here? 
PHOEBE: Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here? 
MONICA: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me? 
PHOEBE: No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning? 
MONICA: How would I know? I-I wasn't here. 
PHOEBE: Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! 
CHANDLER: Oh my God. 
ROSS: You're my friend. I-I had to tell you. 
CHANDLER: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? 
ROSS: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom. 
CHANDLER: What? 
ROSS: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in- 
CHANDLER: You knew about this? 
JOEY: Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. 
CHANDLER: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?! 
JOEY: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened. 
ROSS: Thanks, man, big help. 
CHANDLER: I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking? 
ROSS: I wasn't- I mean, I- 
CHANDLER: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. 
ROSS: I know- 
CHANDLER: I can't believe you did this. 
ROSS: Chandler- 
JOEY: Me neither, y'know what- 
CHANDLER: I'm still mad at you for not telling me. 
JOEY: What are you mad at me for?! 
ROSS: Chandler- 
CHANDLER: You gotta let me slam the door! 
JOEY: Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code? 
ROSS: Joey- 
JOEY: Ah! Huh? 
MONICA: Hey. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
MONICA: 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. 
RACHEL: Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'? 
MONICA: Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'. 
PHOEBE: Hey Rach. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hello. 
MONICA: Hello. 
PHOEBE: Going to the hospital tonight? 
MONICA: No, you? 
PHOEBE: No, you? 
MONICA: You just asked me. 
PHOEBE: Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now? 
RACHEL: Okay. I am so hot! 
JOEY: Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout. 
ROSS: I cannot believe we're having this conversation. 
JOEY: C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all. 
RACHEL: Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay. 
PHOEBE: Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay. 
RACHEL: Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo! 
CHANDLER: What was that? 
ROSS: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a- 
CHANDLER: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? 
JOEY: Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up. 
ROSS: Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips. 
CHANDLER: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare. 
ROSS: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something? 
CHANDLER: Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom! 
ROSS: We're rehearsing a Greek play. 
CHANDLER: That's very funny. We done now? 
ROSS: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel? 
CHANDLER: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her. 
ROSS: Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah! 
PHOEBE: Alright, whadyou do with him? 
MONICA: Oh! You're awake! 
PHOEBE: Look at you! How, how do you feel? 
COMA GUY: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay. 
MONICA: You look good! 
COMA GUY: I feel good! ...Who are you? 
MONICA: Oh, sorry. 
PHOEBE: I'm Phoebe Buffay. 
MONICA: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you. 
PHOEBE: Well, we both have. 
COMA GUY: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys? 
PHOEBE: Well, actually it's just from me. 
MONICA: I got you the foot massager. 
PHOEBE: You know who shaved you? That was me. 
MONICA: I read to you. 
PHOEBE: I sang. Hah! 
COMA GUY: Well,... thanks. 
MONICA: Oh, my pleasure. 
PHOEBE: You're welcome. 
COMA GUY: So. I guess I'll see you around. 
PHOEBE: What, that's it? 
MONICA: 'See you around'? 
COMA GUY: Well, what do you want me to say? 
MONICA: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, 'That was nice'? It meant something to me? 'I'll call you'? 
COMA GUY: Alright, I'll call you. 
PHOEBE: I don't think you mean that. 
MONICA: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe. 
PHOEBE: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma. 
MRS. BING: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon? 
CHANDLER: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough. 
MRS. BING: Alright, well, be good, I love you. 
CHANDLER: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect. 
MRS. BING: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid. 
CHANDLER: Really stupid. 
MRS. BING: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now? 
CHANDLER: Yeah. No. No... 
ROSS: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. 
JOEY: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. 
ROSS: You're kidding. 
JOEY: No, no. He said 'When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?' 
ROSS: Wow! 
JOEY: Then she came back with 'The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?' 
ROSS: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say 'When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?'? 
JOEY: That makes more sense. 
ROSS: So, what's going on now? 
JOEY: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
ROSS: Whaddya see? 
JOEY: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run! 
MRS. BING: You okay, kiddo? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, okay. 
MRS. BING: Alright. 
CHANDLER: Nice save. 
ROSS: Mrs. Bing. 
MRS. BING: Mr. Geller. 
CHANDLER: Hey. 
ROSS: You mean that? 
CHANDLER: Yeah, why not. So I told her. 
ROSS: Yeah? How'd it go? 
CHANDLER: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
ROSS: Well, howdya feel? 
CHANDLER: Pretty good! I told her. 
ROSS: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road. 
RACHEL: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'. 
MONICA: What's a 'niffle'? 
JOEY: You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'. 
RACHEL: Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist... 
ROSS: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those! 
RACHEL: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it! 
ALL: Nooo! 
CHANDLER: No no no no, we're done. 
MONICA : Stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape. 
JOEY: Ross, did you really read all these baby books? 
ROSS: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! 
PHOEBE: Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. 
CHANDLER: And, we're done with the yogurt. 
PHOEBE: Sorry. 
MONICA: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? 
JOEY: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy! 
ROSS: Hello! 
RACHEL: Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos 
PAOLO: Ah, poke a nose, mmm 
JOEY, CHANDLER, ROSS : Mma, Mma, Mmaah 
MONICA: So, did I hear Poconos? 
RACHEL: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend. 
PHOEBE: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together! 
MONICA: Yeah, that's a big step. 
RACHEL: I know... 
CHANDLER: Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal! 
ROSS: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now? 
RACHEL: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally... 
ROSS: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration! 
JOEY: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... 
CHANDLER: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever! 
JOEY: Need a new table. 
CHANDLER: You think? 
CAROL: Hey hey, come on in! 
ROSS: Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna. 
CAROL: Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat. 
ROSS : I'm pretty sure that it is... 
CAROL: So, I got the results of the amnio today. 
ROSS : Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....? 
CAROL: Totally and completely healthy! 
ROSS: Oh, that's great, that is great! 
ROSS: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis? 
CAROL: Uh, that's our friend Tanya. 
ROSS : Of course it's your friend Tanya. 
CAROL: Don't you want to know about the sex? 
ROSS : The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw... 
CAROL: The sex of the baby, Ross. 
ROSS: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh oh oh! 
CAROL: Do you want to know? 
ROSS: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't... 
SUSAN: Oh, hello Ross! 
ROSS: Susan... 
SUSAN: So, so, did you hear? 
ROSS: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK! 
SUSAN: Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...? 
CAROL: Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be... 
ROSS : Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here! 
SUSAN: Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be? 
CAROL: Mm-hmmm 
ROSS: Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? 
CAROL AND SUSAN: It's a--- 
ROSS : No, no ,no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. 
CAROL: Well, thanks for the books. 
ROSS: No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan... 
SUSAN: All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? 
CAROL: Hello? 
CHANDLER: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? 
JOEY: That's the rule. 
CHANDLER: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! 
JOEY: How'd you get to that? 
CHANDLER: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio 
JOEY: You knew about that? 
CHANDLER: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. 
JOEY: Ok, ok, How about if we split it? 
CHANDLER: What do you mean, like, buy it together? 
JOEY: Yeah 
CHANDLER: You think we're ready for something like that? 
JOEY: Why not? 
CHANDLER: Well, it's a big--it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? 
JOEY: Why, are you moving out? 
CHANDLER: I'm not moving out. 
JOEY: You'd tell me if you were moving out right 
CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip 
JOEY: Aw, I know all about Kip! 
CHANDLER: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly 
JOEY: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? 
CHANDLER: Aw, don't do that 
PHOEBE'S ASSISTANT: We've got a couple change s in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu. 
PHOEBE: Ok, thanks. 
ASSISTANT: Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum 
PAOLO: Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here? 
PAOLO: Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh? 
PHOEBE: Well, Racquela's right, yeah! 
PHOEBE: Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started. 
PAOLO: Uh, I am, uh, being naked? 
PHOEBE: Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked! 
RACHEL : I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... 
MONICA: And Monica knows... 
ROSS: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know! 
MONICA: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me. 
JOEY: So what's it gonna be? 
ROSS: Wait--oh--hey--huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know! 
MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt! 
JOEY: Or an uncle... 
JOEY AND CHANDLER: Hey Phoebe! 
ROSS: Hi Pheebs! 
RACHEL: Pheebs! 
PHOEBE: Fine! 
MONICA: Phoebe, what's the matter? 
PHOEBE: Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts. 
CUSTOMER: Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here? 
RACHEL: Oh, right, that's me! 
JOEY: Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. 
CHANDLER: Fine. 
MONICA: Phoebe, what is it? 
PHOEBE: All right, you know Paolo? 
ROSS: I'm familiar with his work, yes... 
PHOEBE: Well, he made a move on me. 
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, store will be open tomorrow! 
CHANDLER: More coffee over here, please! 
PHOEBE: He made a move on me. 
JOEY, CHANDLER: Oooohhh... 
ROSS: My God! 
MONICA: Are you sure? 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. 
MONICA: Was it...? 
PHOEBE: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. 
GUYS: Oooooo.... 
RACHEL: "Ooo", what? 
PHOEBE: Uma Thurman. 
MONICA: Oh! 
ROSS: The actress! 
ROSS: Thanks Rach. 
CHANDLER: So what are you gonna do? 
ROSS: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? 
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her. 
JOEY: Feminist issue. That's where I went! 
PHOEBE: She is gonna hate me. 
ROSS : Yeah, well... 
JOEY: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? 
CHANDLER: That's patio furniture! 
JOEY: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course! 
CHANDLER : What about the birds? 
JOEY: I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something" 
CHANDLER: You pick one. 
JOEY: All right, how about the ladybugs? 
CHANDLER: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! 
JOEY: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! 
CHANDLER: Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds! 
PHOEBE: Hey! 
RACHEL: Hi Pheebs! 
PHOEBE: Are you moving out? 
RACHEL: No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's. 
PHOEBE: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec? 
RACHEL: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over. 
PHOEBE: Oh! Ok, um, ok, um, 
RACHEL: Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs... 
PHOEBE: Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. 
RACHEL : Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, 
PHOEBE: I know. 
RACHEL: Why have I never tasted these before? 
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies 
RACHEL: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. 
PHOEBE: Which proves that I never lie. 
RACHEL: I guess you don't. 
PHOEBE: Paolo made a pass at me. 
CHANDLER: So, what do you think? 
ROSS: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. 
CHANDLER: I know! 
MONICA: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? 
JOEY: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! 
MONICA: Heads up Ross! Score! You suck! 
PHOEBE: Are you okay? 
RACHEL: I need some milk. 
PHOEBE: Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better? 
RACHEL: No...oh!, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed! 
PHOEBE: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on! 
RACHEL: Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened! 
RACHEL AND PHOEBE: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! 
PHOEBE: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about? 
RACHEL: I don't know...right, he's the pig! 
PHOEBE: Such a pig! 
RACHEL: Oh, God, he's such a pig, 
PHOEBE: Oh he's like a... 
RACHEL: He's like a big disgusting... 
PHOEBE: ...like a... 
RACHEL: ...pig...pig man! 
PHOEBE: Yes, good! Ok... 
RACHEL: Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this? 
PHOEBE: Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you... 
RACHEL: Ok, Ok, Pheebs... 
PHOEBE: The end. 
RACHEL: Oh, God... 
PHOEBE: Should I not have told you? 
RACHEL: No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better... 
PHOEBE: I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...we should get over there and see if she's okay. 
MONICA : Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on. 
ROSS : Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. 
JOEY: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team. 
ROSS: Come on, two on one. 
CHANDLER: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! 
ROSS: What, now? 
JOEY: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo! 
CHANDLER: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! 
PAOLO: No, that's cold, that's cold, that's... 
ROSS: How's it going? 
MONICA: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either how could you? or enormous breasts! Here he comes! 
PHOEBE: Ooh! 
PAOLO: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye. 
PHOEBE: Oh, ok bye-bye. 
MONICA: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles. 
PAOLO: Grazie. 
ROSS: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... 
PHOEBE: Oh, just look at her... 
ROSS: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed... 
MONICA: Oh, you're right. 
ROSS: ...and I really think it should be me. 
ROSS: Hey. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
ROSS: You all right? 
RACHEL: Ooh, I've been better... 
ROSS: Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. 
RACHEL: Oh, Ross... 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't' want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. 
ROSS: Huh. 
RACHEL: Oh Ross, you're so great! 
ROSS: Ohhhh 
MONICA: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right? 
RACHEL: Oh... 
PHOEBE: You ok? 
RACHEL: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left? 
PHOEBE: Yep! 
ROSS: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. 
RACHEL: No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want 
ROSS: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo. 
RACHEL: No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. 
ROSS : What? 
RACHEL: What? 
ROSS: I-I'm, I'm having a boy? 
RACHEL: Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy. 
ROSS: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy? 
GIRLS: Yes, you're having a boy! 
ROSS: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy! 
CHANDLER: Wha- 
JOEY: Wha- 
JOEY &AMP; CHANDLER: What is it? 
ROSS: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy! 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHANDLER: Hey! 
JOEY &AMP; CHANDLER: We already knew that! 
ROSS: I'm having a son. Um... 
MONICA: Yes! And that would be a shut-down! 
JOEY &AMP; CHANDLER: Shut-out! 
MONICA: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game! 
JOEY: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning! 
CHANDLER: Yeah--get out! 
MONICA: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone. 
CHANDLER: One more game? 
JOEY: Oh yeah! 
CHANDLER: This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now. 
JOEY: There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss? 
CHANDLER: It's Phoebe! Hi! 
URSULA: Hi. Ok, will that be all? 
CHANDLER: Wait, wait! Wh-What are you doing here? 
URSULA: Yeah, um, I was over there, and then you said "excuse me, hello miss," so now I'm here. 
JOEY: No, no how come are you working here? 
URSULA: Right, yeah, 'cause it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute. 
CHANDLER: Can we start over? 
URSULA: Yeah. Ok, great. I'm gonna be over here. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: No no no! 
ROSS: I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident. 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, I've done that. 
ROSS: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword. 
RACHEL: I've never done that. 
CHANDLER: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister. 
JOEY: I'm sayin' I see a difference. 
CHANDLER: They're twins! 
JOEY: I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's--hot! 
CHANDLER: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things. Let's not do that anymore. 
JOEY: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today. 
PHOEBE: Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson. 
JOEY: Nope. 
PHOEBE: Morly Safer. 
JOEY: Nope. 
PHOEBE: The woman who cuts my hair! 
MONICA: Ok, look, this could be a really long game. 
CHANDLER: Your sister Ursula. 
PHOEBE: Oh, really. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh-- 
PHOEBE: Riff's. Yeah, I know. 
CHANDLER: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years. 
PHOEBE: Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat? 
JOEY: Not from where I was standin'. 
PHOEBE: Where were you standing? 
RACHEL: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along? 
PHOEBE: It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new"? 
ROSS: Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class. 
CHANDLER: Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in gym. 
RACHEL: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol? 
ROSS: No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team. 
RACHEL: Well, isn't that gonna be weird? 
ROSS: No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation. 
MONICA: Ross, that's my jacket. 
ROSS: I know. 
WOMAN: Hi, we're the Rostins. I'm J.C., and he's Michael, and we're having a boy, and a girl. 
TEACHER: Good for you. Next? 
ROSS: I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's. .. Who's next? 
TEACHER: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Susan is Carol's--? 
ROSS: Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend. 
CAROL: Life partner. 
ROSS: Like buddies. 
SUSAN: Like lovers. 
ROSS: You know how close women can get. 
CAROL: Susan and I live together. 
ROSS: Although I was married to her. 
SUSAN: Carol, not me. 
ROSS: Right. 
CAROL: It's a little complicated. 
ROSS: A little. 
SUSAN: But we're fine. 
ROSS: Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch. 
CHANDLER: And to you too, Helen. 
HELEN: Nina Bookbinder is here to see you. 
CHANDLER: Oh, ok. Send her in. 
NINA: Hi. 
CHANDLER: Hi, Nina. Come on in. 
NINA: You wanted to see me? 
CHANDLER: Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers. 
NINA: Which is bad because--? 
CHANDLER: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack. 
NINA: Your--Excuse me? 
CHANDLER: WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics. 
NINA: Oh, right. Gotcha. It won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your...WENUS. 
CHANDLER: It's not just that she's cute, ok. It's just that she's really really cute. 
ROSS: It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink. 
MONICA: Ross, your little creature's got the remote again. 
ROSS: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote... 
MONICA: Great. 
ROSS: Relax, I'll fix it. 
RACHEL: Oh, cool. "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel". 
ROSS: How did he do this? 
CHANDLER: So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long? 
MONICA: No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot. 
RACHEL: Well someone was supposed to write "Rache, take down the lights" and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there? 
CHANDLER: Hey, where you been? 
JOEY: I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries. 
CHANDLER: Score. 
JOEY: She is so hot. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, listen. Before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by, uh-- 
JOEY: Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister? 
PHOEBE: Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why? 
JOEY: So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there. 
PHOEBE: Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not? 
JOEY: Cool, thanks. 
ROSS: You ok? 
PHOEBE: Yeah I'm fine. 
ROSS: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley? 
ROSS: Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol? 
SUSAN: Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information. 
ROSS: No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on. 
SUSAN: Oh, good. This'll be fun. 
TEACHER: All righty. We're gonna start with some basic first-stage breathing exercises, so Mommies, why don't you get on your backs, and coaches, you should be supporting Mommy's head. 
ROSS: What? What? 
SUSAN: What? What? 
SUSAN: I am supposed to be the mommy? 
ROSS: Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time. 
SUSAN: Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman. 
ROSS: I see. So what do you propose to do? 
SUSAN: I will flip you for it. 
ROSS: Flip me for it? No, no, no--heads, heads! 
SUSAN: On your back, Mom. 
TEACHER: All right, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath. Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower. 
CHANDLER: Mr. D, how's it going, sir?? 
MR. DOUGLAS: It's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in. 
CHANDLER: And? 
MR. DOUGLAS: It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies. 
CHANDLER: So what does this mean? 
MR. DOUGLAS: Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department. 
CHANDLER: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very-- 
MR. DOUGLAS: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone? 
CHANDLER: Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina. 
NINA: Are you ok? 
CHANDLER: Yes, yes I am. Listen, the reason that I called you in here today is, uh, please don't hate me. 
NINA: What? 
CHANDLER: Would you like to have dinner sometime? 
RACHEL: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday? 
PHOEBE: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me. 
RACHEL: Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn? 
PHOEBE: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice. 
JAMIE: What is this place? 
FRAN: Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be? 
JAMIE: I think we have an answer. 
FRAN: What's she doing here? 
JAMIE: This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home. 
FRAN: Think she got fired at Riff's? 
JAMIE: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept bringing swordfish. Are you gonna go-- 
FRAN: I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right. 
JAMIE: It looks like her. Um, excuse me. 
PHOEBE: Yeah? 
JAMIE: Hi, it's us. 
PHOEBE: Right, and it's me. 
JAMIE: So, so you're here too? 
PHOEBE: Much as you are. 
JAMIE: Your turn. 
FRAN: We know what we want. 
PHOEBE: Oh, that's good. 
JAMIE: All we want is two cafe lattes. 
FRAN: And some biscotti cookies. 
PHOEBE: Good choice. 
JAMIE: Definitely her. 
FRAN: Yeah. 
MONICA: I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet? 
CHANDLER: Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights. 
MONICA: Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument. 
CHANDLER: I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know? 
RACHEL: Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work. 
JOEY: Hey. 
CHANDLER: You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore. 
MONICA: I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles. 
MR. HECKLES: You're doing it again. 
MONICA: We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly. 
MR. HECKLES: I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep. 
RACHEL: You don't even have cats. 
MR. HECKLES: I could have cats. 
MONICA: Goodbye Mr. Heckles. 
RACHEL: We'll try to keep it down. 
JOEY: Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits. 
PHOEBE: Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really-- 
JOEY: Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise. 
PHOEBE: Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits. 
RACHEL: Are you seein' her again tonight? 
JOEY: Yep. Ice Capades. 
CHANDLER: Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade. 
JOEY: I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that-- 
PHOEBE: That you like. We get it. You like her. Great. 
JOEY: Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok. 
PHOEBE: All right, well, maybe now it's not ok. 
JOEY: Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok. 
PHOEBE: Ok. 
CHANDLER: Knit, good woman, knit, knit! 
CHANDLER: And that's the Chrysler building right there. 
MR. DOUGLAS: Nina. 
NINA: Mr. Douglas. Cool tie. 
MR. DOUGLAS: She's still here. 
CHANDLER: Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Fl---, Dr Flanen, Dr. Flan, and uh, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he uh, mentioned the word "frenzy". 
MR. DOUGLAS: You're kidding? She seems so-- 
CHANDLER: Oh, no, no. Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. 
MR. DOUGLAS: That's unbelievable. 
CHANDLER: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others. 
MR. DOUGLAS: I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head. 
CHANDLER: Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir. 
TEACHER: Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our last class. 
ROSS: Susan, go deep. 
CAROL: This is impossible. It's just impossible. 
SUSAN: What is, honey? 
CAROL: What that woman did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in. That's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in. 
ROSS: Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right. 
CAROL: What do you know? No one's come up to you and said, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?" 
SUSAN: Carol, Carol, please. Cleansing breath. I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives. I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross? 
ROSS: I'm gonna be a father. 
RACHEL: It's just occurring to you? 
ROSS: I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me. 
RACHEL: Oh, you're gonna be great! 
ROSS: Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid? 
CHANDLER: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different. 
PHOEBE: Where're you going? 
JOEY: Out. 
PHOEBE: With? 
JOEY: Yes. 
PHOEBE: All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know...like, you know, you know, yet? 
JOEY: Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right? 
NINA: Do you have a sec? 
CHANDLER: Uh, sure, Nina. What's up? 
NINA: I don't know. For the past couple of days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. 
CHANDLER: Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're uh, jealous of us. 
NINA: Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors. 
CHANDLER: Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise. 
NINA: I am? 
CHANDLER: Sure, why not? 
NINA: Oh my god! You're amazing. 
CHANDLER: Oh, you don't know. Helen, would you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise? 
HELEN: Do you still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel? 
NINA: What? 
CHANDLER: Helen drinks. Will you marry me? 
CHANDLER: Well, I ended up telling her everything. 
RACHEL: Oh, how'd she take it? 
CHANDLER: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk. 
MONICA: Ok, I think I get how to do this. 
PHOEBE: All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it--make them go away? I can't, I can't look. 
MONICA: Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing. 
RACHEL: Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible? 
PHOEBE: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? 
MONICA &AMP; RACHEL: No. 
PHOEBE: Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but-- 
CHANDLER: You're not gonna lose him. 
MONICA: Come on, you gotta talk to Joey. 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 
ROSS: Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt-- 
PHOEBE: But he's falling in love with her. 
RACHEL: Please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious. 
PHOEBE: Ok. Oh, ok, oh. 
URSULA: Oh. Yeah, um, may we help you? 
MONICA: Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside? 
RACHEL: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so I'm takin' 'em down. Ok? Whoa! 
RACHEL: I'm ok! I'm ok! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please? 
MR. HECKLES: See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about. 
RACHEL: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. 
MONICA: Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something. 
NURSE: My god. You still have your Christmas lights up? Fill this out and bring it back to me. 
RACHEL: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. 
MONICA: All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call? 
RACHEL: You. 
MONICA: Really? 
RACHEL: Yeah. 
MONICA: Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance? 
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance? 
RACHEL: Why, how much is this gonna cost? 
MONICA: I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars. 
RACHEL: Well what are we gonna do? 
MONICA: There's not much we can do. 
RACHEL: Um, unless, unless I use yours. 
MONICA: No no no no no no no no no. 
RACHEL: Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" call person? 
MONICA: That's insurance fraud. 
RACHEL: Well, all right, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow! 
MONICA: Ok. Ok. I hate this. 
RACHEL: Thank you. Thank you. I love you. 
MONICA: Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms. 
NURSE: Why? 
MONICA: I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine. 
NURSE: You are an idiot. 
MONICA: Yep, that's me. I am that stupid. 
ROSS: I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. 
CHANDLER &AMP; JOEY: That's nice. 
ROSS: No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me. 
JOEY: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. 
ROSS: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield. 
CHANDLER: What are you crazy? That's a baby! 
JOEY: He should take the sack? 
ROSS: Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father. 
CHANDLER: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad. 
JOEY: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? 
CHANDLER: Well, only if you order stuff. 
JOEY: I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. 
ROSS: Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday? 
JOEY: When's that? 
ROSS: Tonight. 
JOEY: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? 
ROSS: You take your time. 
CHANDLER: There it is! So what're you gonna do? 
JOEY: What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. 
CHANDLER: And your friend Phoebe? 
JOEY: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys? 
CHANDLER: Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit. 
DR. MITCHELL: Ok, uh, Monica? 
MONICA: Yes, yes she is. 
RACHEL: Hi, this is my friend Rachel. 
MONICA: Hi. 
DR. MITCHELL: Hi, Rachel. I'm Dr. Mitchell. 
DR. ROSIN: And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosin. 
RACHEL: Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor? 
DR. ROSIN: Excuse me? 
RACHEL: I meant young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh, Good Rach. 
MONICA: Thank you. 
RACHEL: Right. 
RACHEL: So, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it. 
MONICA: Uh, you left out the stupid part. 
RACHEL: Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes. 
MONICA: I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates. 
RACHEL: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute! 
CHANDLER: All right, what have we learned so far? 
ALL: Surprise! 
ROSS: What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me. 
RACHEL: Was that the cake? 
ROSS: Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush. 
MONICA: Come on, she'll be here any minute. 
RACHEL: I hope it's ok. 
CHANDLER: Happy birthday Peehee. 
MONICA: Well maybe we can make a "b" out of one of those roses. 
ROSS: Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools. 
PHOEBE: Hey, what's going on? 
ALL: Surprise! 
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey? 
CHANDLER: Did you see Betty? 
MR. GELLER: I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd 'a' said "get out of my office!" 
ROSS: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? 
MR. GELLER: I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea-- 
ROSS: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing? 
MR. GELLER: No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about? 
ROSS: No, no, Dad, I was just wondering. 
MR. GELLER: 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can still do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that? 
ROSS: Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father? 
MR. GELLER: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg? 
ROSS: No, we can go to Williamsburg. 
MR. GELLER: Eat your fish. 
MONICA: Rachel, the cute doctors are here. 
RACHEL: Ok, coming! 
MONICA: Hi, come on in. 
DR. MITCHELL: Here, we brought wine. 
DR. ROSIN: And this is from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist? 
RACHEL: Oh, that's great. Look at that. 
DR. ROSIN: Monica, how's the ankle? 
MONICA: It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle. 
RACHEL: You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you. Well, listen, why don't you two sit down, and we'll get you some glasses....STAT. 
RACHEL: Ok, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are. I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine, I really do. 
MONICA: It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble. 
RACHEL: Would you stop being such a wuss? 
MONICA: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok? 
DR. MITCHELL: So? 
DR. ROSIN: So, they still seem normal. 
MITCHELL: That's because they are normal. 
ROSIN: Ok, but you have to admit that every time we go out with women we meet at the hospital, it turns into-- 
MITCHELL: Would you relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this. 
MONICA: I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby. 
RACHEL: I am not a baby. You know what? 
MONICA: What? 
RACHEL: You know what? 
MONICA: What? 
RACHEL: Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. 
ROSIN: This is a great place. How long have you lived here? 
RACHEL: I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago. 
MONICA: Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus? 
ROSIN: So, Monica, what do you do? 
RACHEL: Uh, I'm a uh, chef at a restaurant uptown. 
ROSIN: Good for you. 
RACHEL: Yeah it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do. 
ROSIN: This hummus is great. 
MITCHELL: God bless the chickpea. 
MONICA: Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it. 
RACHEL: And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow. 
MONICA: I used to wet my bed. 
RACHEL: I use my breasts to get other people's attention. 
MONICA: We both do that. 
DR. MITCHELL: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Just a minute. Rachel, it's your dad. 
MONICA: Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had sex on your bed. 
RACHEL: Daddy, daddy, why? Why would I sleep with Billy Drestin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead! 
MONICA: Ross, he's got the remote again. 
ROSS: Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not. 
RACHEL: Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, hold on a second. Let me see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Oh, god, what do we do, what do we do? 
MONICA: Find out what they want. 
RACHEL: No, you do it. 
MONICA: Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you. 
RACHEL: What? 
MONICA: We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms. 
RACHEL: You were right, this was just not worth it. 
MONICA: Thank you. 
RACHEL: Ok, let me just change. 
JOEY: Hey. 
ROSS: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hi. Trouble? 
JOEY: Your sister stood me up the other night. 
PHOEBE: Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you? 
ROSS: Well did you try calling her? 
JOEY: I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off. 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
URSULA: Oh. 
PHOEBE: Um, you, got a minute? 
URSULA: Um, yeah, I'm just working. 
PHOEBE: So. 
URSULA: Uh-huh. 
PHOEBE: Um, oh, I got you a birthday present. 
URSULA: Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh, it's a Judy Jetson thermos. 
PHOEBE: Right, like the kind you-- 
URSULA: Right. Oh, I got something for you too. 
PHOEBE: How'd you know I was coming? 
URSULA: Um, yeah, um, twin thing. 
PHOEBE: I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this. 
URSULA: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over. 
PHOEBE: Does he know? 
URSULA: Who? 
PHOEBE: Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you. 
URSULA: He is? Why? 
PHOEBE: You got me. 
URSULA: Right. Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad? 
PHOEBE: So, um, are you gonna call him? 
URSULA: Why, do you think he likes me? 
PHOEBE: No. Joey. 
URSULA: Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken? 
PHOEBE: No. No food with a face. 
URSULA: You have not changed. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, you too. 
RACHEL: Hi, remember us? 
NURSE: Mmm hmmm. 
MONICA: You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um... 
NURSE: You're that stupid. 
MONICA: I am. I'm that stupid. 
RACHEL: And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check. 
NURSE: You know your insurance will cover that. 
RACHEL: I know. I'm just not that bright either. 
CHANDLER: Ok, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. 
ROSS: Do you have a point? 
CHANDLER: You know, you'd think I would. What's up with the simian? 
ROSS: It's just a furball. 
CHANDLER: Ok, who's turn is it? 
ROSS: Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney". 
CHANDLER: No, no, you got zero points for "idney". 
ROSS: I had a "k". Where's my "k"? 
ROSS: You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a "k"! 
NURSE: You get that animal out of here. 
ROSS: No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do. 
MONICA: What's goin' on? 
CHANDLER: Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile. 
NURSE: Excuse me. This hospital is for people. 
ROSS: Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart! 
DR. MITCHELL: I'll take a look at him. 
RACHEL AND MONICA: Oh, thank you. 
MONICA: Michael. 
DR. MITCHELL: Rachel. 
RACHEL: What? 
MONICA: Monica. 
RACHEL: Oh. 
MONICA: Hi. 
RACHEL: Hi. 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
JOEY: Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you. 
PHOEBE: Listen, um. 
JOEY: No, no, no, don't say "listen". I know that "listen". I've said that "listen". 
PHOEBE: I'm sorry. 
JOEY: I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge? 
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk. 
JOEY: You don't drink 
JOEY: Urs-- 
PHOEBE: Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work. 
JOEY: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe? 
PHOEBE: If it was, would you stop hanging out with her? 
JOEY: No. No, I, I couldn't do that. 
PHOEBE: Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me. 
JOEY: Then, uh, then I'm sorry. 
PHOEBE: You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over. 
JOEY: I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful. 
PHOEBE: Really? 
JOEY: Pheebs? 
PHOEBE: Yeah. 
ROSS: He looks so tiny. 
JOEY: We just got the message. 
PHOEBE: Is he all right? 
ROSS: Yeah. The doctor got the "k" out. He also found an "m" and an "o". 
CHANDLER: We think he was trying to spell out "monkey". 
ROSS: Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now. 
CHANDLER: So, you feel like a dad yet? 
ROSS: No, why? 
CHANDLER: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad. 
ROSS: Aqui esta 
MONICA: Para mi 
PHOEBE: Y quien pidio el pollo General Tso? 
CHANDLER: Pudo haber sido el General Tso 
RACHEL: Miren! El viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop! (Look! The naked old man is hula hooping! 
ALL: Hola, Joey 
JOEY: Hola, amigos 
MONICA: Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el contro remoto 
ROSS: Y el caso es que no le gusta la tele 
ROSS: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here. 
MNCA: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics? 
CHAN: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for. 
RACH: Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...' 
ROSS: Rach, did you proofread these? 
RACH: Uh... yeah, why? 
ROSS: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills. 
RACH: Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them? 
JOEY: Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few. 
MNCA: Hey, guys. 
CHAN, ROSS: Hey. 
RACH: Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail? 
MNCA: Lots of responses. 
RACH: : Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me. 
PHOE: : Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... 
RACH: : We have apple cinnamon... 
MNCA: : OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. 
PHOE: Wow! 
RACH: What? 
PHOE: : Your Visa bill is huge! 
RACH: Give me that! 
CHAN: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again? 
ROSS: I don't know. 
CHAN: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing? 
ROSS: No, it's not just that. It's just--I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... 
CHAN: ...little playthings with yarn? 
ROSS: What? 
CHAN: Could you want her more? 
ROSS: Who? 
CHAN: Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening. 
ROSS: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii! 
RACH: Hi! How are you? 
ROSS: We're fine, we're fine. 
RACH: OK. 
JOEY: Shut up! 
CHAN: We're not--we're not saying anything. 
PHOE: What? 
ROSS: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night. 
JOEY: Thank you. 
CHAN: We were playing poker, alright... 
JOEY: There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? 
ROSS: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.' 
CHAN: And then he did. 
RACH: Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us? 
PHOE: Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play? 
ROSS: No, women are welcome to play. 
PHOE: Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it? 
CHAN: There just don't happen to be any women in our games. 
JOEY: Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker. 
GIRLS: Oh, yeah, right. 
MNCA: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse! 
RACH: Really. 
MNCA: I mean, that's a typical guy response. 
ROSS: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play? 
GIRLS: No. 
RACH: But you could teach us. 
GUYS: No. 
CHAN: OK, so now we draw cards. 
MNCA: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight. 
RACH: Oh, good for you! 
PHOE: Congratulations! 
CHAN: OK Phoebs, how many do you want? 
PHOE: OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs. 
ROSS: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't--you can't do-- 
RACH: Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! ROSS: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that. 
RACH: Oh, no no no no no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours. 
ROSS: Oh, you're... 
MNCA: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites. 
PHOE, RACH: OOooooo! 
JOEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz-- 
CHAN: OK, so at this point, the dealer-- 
MNCA: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks... 
ROSS: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy... 
PHOE: But... I'm ready, so, just deal. 
CHAN: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards. 
MNCA: Dammit, dammit, dammit! 
PHOE: : Oh I see, so then, you were lying. 
JOEY: About what? 
PHOE: About how good your cards were. 
JOEY: Heh... I was bluffing. 
PHOE: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying? 
RACH: OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... 
GUYS: Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
CHAN: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle. 
RACH: Settle what? 
CHAN: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... 
ROSS: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game. 
RACH: Oh. Right. 
JOEY: You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright? 
MNCA: Hell no, we'll pay! 
PHOE: OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready. 
MNCA: And you know what? We want a rematch. 
ROSS: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money. 
RACH: : So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends. 
ROSS: ...Yeah. 
CHAN: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. 
ROSS: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... 
JOEY: ...Yeah? 
ROSS: I'm not a nice guy. 
ROSS: Alright boys, let's eat. 
CHAN: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria? 
ROSS: You still on that? 
CHAN: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy! 
ROSS: You are way off, pal. 
JOEY: No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her. 
ROSS: Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time--not any more. I just--I-- 
ROSS: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? 
ROSS: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK--if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. 
RACH: Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? 
MNCA: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. 
PHOE: Ha. Ha, ha. 
MNCA: What? 
PHOE: Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. 
MNCA: Please! I am not as bad as Ross. 
RACH: Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident? 
MNCA: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand. 
RACH: Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! 
MNCA: You're kidding! Where? Where? 
RACH: : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue. 
MNCA: Oh, Rachel! 
PHOE: Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home. 
MNCA: Well, what's the job? 
RACH: Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living! 
MNCA: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi! 
IRIS: Is Tony Randall dead? 
RACH: No. 
MNCA: I don't think so. 
RACH: Why? 
IRIS: Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car. 
MNCA: What? 
RACH: Oh my God! 
MNCA: Really? 
IRIS: No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings. 
PHOE: Thank y-- 
IRIS: Girls, sit down. 
MNCA: Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel... 
IRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it. 
PHOE: Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? 
ROSS: Alright. 
ROSS: I'm gonna pay for that tonight. 
RACH: Hi! 
ROSS: Hey. 
RACH: Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! 
CHAN: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? 
RACH: Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and--oh, I went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! 
ALL: That's great! That's wonderful! 
RACH: Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story-- 
MNCA: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker. 
JOEY: Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand. 
CHAN: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary? 
MNCA: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies? 
PHOE/RACH: Yes, we should. I think we should. 
ROSS: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those? 
RACH: No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go. 
ROSS: Alright. 
RACH: Alright... 
ROSS: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. 
JOEY: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game. 
PHOE: Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed. 
JOEY: What? 
PHOE: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. 
CHAN: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie. 
ROSS: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... 
RACH: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. 
MNCA: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever. 
RACH: Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon. 
ROSS: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing. 
RACH: Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy. 
MNCA: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker? 
PHOE: Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker. 
MNCA: Excuse me, where are you going? 
ROSS: Uh... to the bathroom. 
MNCA: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker? 
ROSS: I want to go to the bathroom. 
JOEY: Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. 
RACH: Oh no no no no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then. 
JOEY: That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over. 
MNCA: Alright, Cincinatti, no blinds, everybody ante. 
PHOE: Yes! .... or no. 
ROSS: Alright. : Your money's mine, Green. 
RACH: Your fly is open, Geller. 
PHOE: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? 
CHAN: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'! 
JOEY: Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe? 
PHOE: Yeah. Um... I'm out. 
RACH: I'm in. 
MNCA: Me too. 
JOEY: Me too. Alright, whattaya got. 
ROSS: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. 
RACH: Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I think--oh--that one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it... 
RACH: And your fly's still open... 
RACH: Ha, I made you look.... 
RACH: I couldn't be inner. Monica? 
PHOE: Monica, in or out? 
MNCA: I hate this game! 
PHOE: OK Joey, your bet. 
JOEY: Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out. 
PHOE: Ross? 
ROSS: Oh, I am very in. 
PHOE: Chandler? 
CHAN: Couldn't be more out. 
PHOE: Me too. Rachel. 
RACH: Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck? 
ROSS: No, not this time. So... what'd you have? 
RACH: I'm not telling. 
ROSS: Come on, show them to me. 
RACH: No..! 
ROSS: Show them to me! 
RACH: Get your hands out of there! No! 
ROSS: Let me see! Show them! 
CHAN: Y'know, I've had dates like this. 
RACH: Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple... 
PHOE: Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants. 
ROSS: First of all, I'm not losing... 
RACH: Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. 
ROSS: Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the-- 
RACH: Hel-lo, Rachel Green. 
ROSS: Mee mee, mee-mee mee. 
RACH: : Excuse me. : It's about the job. 
RACH: Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea--Hello? Hello? 
MNCA: Sorry, Rach. 
PHOE: Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff. 
RACH: Yeah.......OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante. 
JOEY: Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this. 
RACH: Yes, we do. 
MNCA: Alright, check. 
JOEY: Check. 
ROSS: I'm in for fifty cents. 
CHAN: Call. 
PHOE: I'm in. 
RACH: I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. 
ROSS: I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit. 
RACH: Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that? 
RACH: : Loser? 
ROSS: No, I fold. 
RACH: What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it? 
ROSS: I'm in. 
RACH: How many you want? 
ROSS: One. 
RACH: Dealer takes two. What do you bet? 
ROSS: I bet two dollars. 
RACH: OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. 
ROSS: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. 
RACH: See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse. 
MNCA: Rachel, there's nothing in it. 
RACH: OK, then get me your purse. 
MNCA: OK, here you go. Good luck. 
RACH: : Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven. 
PHOE: ...teen! 
ROSS: : Joey, I'm a little shy. 
JOEY: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What? 
CHAN: : What do you need, what do you need? 
ROSS: Fifteen. 
CHAN: Alright, here's ten. 
JOEY: Here, I got five, I got five. 
ROSS: Thank you. 
CHAN: Good luck. 
ROSS: : OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got? 
RACH: Full house. 
ROSS: You got me. 
JOEY: : Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat. 
CHAN: : I thought we had them! 
ROSS: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is. 
CHAN: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79! 
RACH: Oh, time's up. 
MNCA: Bye... bye... BIRDIE. 
JOEY: Oh! 
PHOE: That's a bird? 
PHOE: That's a bird! 
RACH: OK, OK, it's my turn. 
CHAN: Go. 
ROSS: Uh.... bean! Bean! 
JOEY: The Unbearable Likeness of Being! 
RACH: Yes! 
MNCA: That, you get? That, you get? 
RACHEL: OK, OK, I checked, we have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and er, oh wait, there was one more, erm, Lemon Soother! 
CUSTOMER: 
RACHEL: You're not the guy who asked for the tea, are you? .... OK. 
MONICA: Mail call. Rachel Green. Bunk 7. 
RACHEL: Thank you...Oh cool. Free sample of coffee. 
MONICA: Oh good, 'cos where else would we get any? 
RACHEL: Oh. Right.... Oh great. 
MONICA: What is it? 
RACHEL: Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration.... Oh my god... Oh my god, it's Barry and Mindy! 
MONICA: Barry who you almost...? 
RACHEL: Barry who I almost... 
MONICA: And Mindy your maid of...? 
RACHEL: Mindy my maid of... 
MONICA: Let me see... That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty.... lucky.... to have had a friend like you! 
ROSS: Marcel, bring me the rice! Come on! Bring me the rice! Come on! Good boy! Good boy! Come on, give me the rice!.... Thank you. Good boy! Ah I see he's finally mastered the difference between "bring me the" and "pee in the".... "Bring me the" and... Rache? 
RACHEL: What? 
ROSS: Hi! 
RACHEL: Oh! I'm sorry. Oh. This is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? 
ROSS: Mmm. 
RACHEL: I should be happy for them.... I am. I'm happy for them. 
ROSS: Really? 
RACHEL: No.... Oh.... Oh, I guess it'd be different if I were, with somebody. 
ROSS: Whoa. What, er, what happened to, er, "forget relationships", "I'm done with men", the whole, er, penis embargo? 
RACHEL: Oh. I don't know. I guess it's not about "no guys", it's about the "right guy" you know? 
ROSS: Mmm. 
RACHEL: I mean with Barry, it was, it was safe, and it was easy, but there was no heat. 
ROSS: Mmm. 
RACHEL: You know with Paulo, that all there was, was heat. I, I mean it was just this raw, animal, sexual... 
ROSS: Right, right. I, I got it. I was there. 
RACHEL: Ah. I mean, do you think you can ever have both? You know, someone who's, like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl? 
ROSS: Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Yes! I do! I really do! Er, in fact, it's funny. Very often, someone who you wouldn't think could, could, curl your toes, might just be the one who, er, who... 
MONICA: Hi! 
ROSS: ...gets interrupted! Hi! 
RACHEL: Hey guys, how was the movie? 
PHOEBE: Oh, it was so good. 
MONICA: Wonderful. 
JOEY: Suckfest! 
CHANDLER: Total chick-flick! 
PHOEBE: I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, you know, like guns and bombs and like buses going really fast. 
JOEY: Hey. I don't need violence to enjoy a movie, just so long as there's a little nudity. 
MONICA: There was nudity! 
JOEY: I meant female nudity! Alright, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking! 
MONICA AND PHOEBE: Hugh! Hugh Grant! 
ROSS: Alright. I've gotta go. Come on Marcel, come on. Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes we are! 
CHANDLER: They're still just friends, right? 
RACHEL: And I will see you tomorrow! 
ROSS: That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you? Huh? 
MONICA: Huh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this? 
ROSS: Pwease Aunt Monica, Pwease! Oh. Unclench. You're not even gonna be here! 
CHANDLER: You know, I cannot believe we are even having this discussion. 
JOEY: I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief. 
CHANDLER: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would have, happened already? 
ROSS: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me. 
JOEY: She really said that? 
ROSS: Well, I added the "exactly like me" part, but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. 
JOEY: Tonight, tonight? 
ROSS: Well, I think it's perfect, you know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she's spent all day taking care of my monkey... 
CHANDLER: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. 
JOEY: 
ROSS: Anyway, you know, I figured after work, I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there, and, er, try to woo her. 
CHANDLER: Hey. You know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's when that phrase was last used. 
TV: You keep this up honey, and I swear, you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week. 
RACHEL: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr.Francis, now she used to be a man. OK? Oh look see, now there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. An... Wh... M... Marcel? Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to p...Whoa! Whoa! Marcel? Did you poo in the shoe? Oh my god. Bad, bad. Oh god. Oh. Sorry Barry. A little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that! 
TV: 
JOEY: How could you loose him? 
RACHEL: I don't know, I don't know, we were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe... 
MONICA: Wait... He pooped in my shoe? Which one? 
RACHEL: I don't know... The left one. 
MONICA: Which ones? 
RACHEL: Oh, oh, those little clunkly Amish things you think go with everything. 
PHOEBE: Hey, hi. Whoa, oh, why is the air in here so negative? 
CHANDLER: Rachel lost Marcel. 
PHOEBE: Oh no, how? 
MONICA: He, he pooped in my shoe. 
PHOEBE: Which one? 
MONICA: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time. 
PHOEBE: No. Which one? The right or left? Cos the left one is lucky... 
RACHEL: Come on you guys, what am I going to do? What are we going to do? 
JOEY: Alright, alright, alright, you're a monkey, you're loose in the city... Where do you go? 
CHANDLER: OK. It's his first time out, so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things... I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian tea-room. 
RACHEL: Oh my god. Come on you guys. He's gonna be home any minute. He's gonna kill me. 
MONICA: OK. We'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I will take third and fourth. 
RACHEL: Wha, wha, wh, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? 
MONICA: OK. You stay here. You just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you. 
RACHEL: Does anybody wanna trade? Oh. 
MONICA: 
HECKLES: What do you want? 
MONICA: Mr.Heckles. Our, our friends lost a monkey. Have you seen it? 
HECKLES: I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it? 
MONICA: No! 
PHOEBE: Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? 
HECKLES: I wasn't ready for it. 
MONICA: The monkey? Have you seen a monkey? 
HECKLES: Saw Regis Philbin once... 
PHOEBE: OK. Thank you Mr.Heckles 
HECKLES: You owe me a waffle. 
RACHEL: OK. He's a, he's a black Capuchin monkey, with a white face... 
RACHEL: ...with, with Russian dressing, and pickles on the side. OK. Thanks... Hi! 
ROSS: Hi. Hey, how did it go today? 
RACHEL: Oh, great! It went great. Really great... Hey! Is that wine? 
ROSS: Yeah, yeah. You, er, you want some? 
RACHEL: Oh, I would love some, but you know what? You know what? Let's not drink it here... I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark? 
ROSS: Er... OK... Yeah. We can do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North East, I was, er, kinda wanted to run something by you... You know how we were, er, you know, talking before, about, er, relationships and stuff, well... 
RACHEL: Oh god, Ross. I cannot do this... 
ROSS: OK. Quick and painful. 
RACHEL: Oh god. OK. Alright, alright. OK. Ross, please don't hate me... 
ROSS: No, why? What, what? 
RACHEL: Ah. You know Marcel? 
ROSS: Yeah? 
RACHEL: Well, I, kinda , kind of lost him... 
ROSS: I, I, I can't, I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment. 
RACHEL: I know, I know, I'm sorry... 
ROSS: No, no. You know what? I guess it's partially my fault, you know, I shouldn't have asked you to, er, start off with a monkey. I should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil. 
RACHEL: Ross. I'm doing everything that I can. I've got everybody looking for him, and then I... 
INTERCOM: BZZZZZ 
RACHEL: Who is it? 
INTERCOM: Animal Control. 
RACHEL: See, I've even got Animal Control... 
ROSS: You've called Animal Control? 
RACHEL: Uh-huh. Why? Do you not like them? 
ROSS: Huh! Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me... 
RACHEL: OK. Well, now, see, you never ever ever told us that... 
ROSS: That's right, cos I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! 
RACHEL: Hi! Thanks for coming! 
AC: Somebody called about a monkey? 
RACHEL: Oh. Oh yeah! You know what? That was a complete misunderstanding. 
ROSS: Yeah. We, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't. 
RACHEL: It turned out it was a hat! 
ROSS: Cat! 
RACHEL: Cat! What did I say? Cat. 
MONICA: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel. 
AC: Marcel? 
ROSS: My uncle Marcel... 
PHOEBE: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after? 
AC: OK. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, er, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal? 
PHOEBE: Oh my god. You'd put that poor little creature in jail? 
MONICA: Phoebes? You remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? 
PHOEBE: Yes, but there isn't always time... 
MONICA: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Erm, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced. I, I'm Monica Geller... 
AC: Oh my god, you are! And you're Rachel Green! 
RACHEL: Yeah! 
AC: Louisa Jeanette. Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in, in homeroom! 
RACHEL: Louisa? Oh my god! Monica! It's Louisa! 
MONICA: Louisa! From homeroom! 
RACHEL: Yes! 
LOUISA: You have no idea who I am, do you? 
RACHEL: No. 
MONICA: Not at all. 
LOUISA: Well. Maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say "Morning Louisa" or "nice overalls"? 
MONICA: Oh, I'm so sorry. 
LOUISA: Nah. It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems... But you! What a bitch! 
RACHEL: WHAT? 
MONICA: Alright, you know what? Be that as it may, you think you could help us out here on that monkey thing? You know, just for old time's sake? "Go Bobcats!" 
LOUISA: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey... He's mine! 
PHOEBE: Dun, dun, dun... Sorry. 
CHANDLER: Marcel? 
JOEY: Marcel? 
CHANDLER: Marcel? 
JOEY: Marcel? 
BW1: Hi. Can I help you? 
CHANDLER: ! 
JOEY: ! 
CHANDLER: Er, we're kind of having an emergency, and we were, er, looking for something. 
JOEY: A monkey. 
CHANDLER: Yes. Have you seen any? 
BW1: No. No. Haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? 
JOEY: Sure, sure. Did you, er, did you try turning the knob back the other way? 
BW1: Of course. 
JOEY: Ah, then, no. 
BW2: Taste this... Is there too much rum in here? 
BW1: Just a sec. I hope you find your monkey... 
CHANDLER: Oh, no, wait, wait, no, wait, wait. Erm, we may not know anything about radiators, per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling milieu... 
JOEY: Er, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here? 
CHANDLER: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help... And they're very hot! 
JOEY: We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out! 
CHANDLER: OK. From now on, you don't get to talk to other people. 
JOEY: Marcel! 
CHANDLER: Marcel! 
MONICA: Marcel? 
PHOEBE: Marcel? 
MONICA: Marcel? 
PHOEBE: Oh my god! . Something just brushed up against my right leg! 
MONICA: What is it? 
PHOEBE: Oh, oh. It's OK! It was just my left leg. 
MONICA: Look, Phoebe! 
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel, come here. Oh come here Marcel... 
LOUISA: Step aside ladies... 
MONICA: What are you gonna do? 
LOUISA: Just a small tranquilliser... 
MONICA: Run Marcel! Run! Run Marcel! 
LOUISA: Damn 
MONICA: Are you OK? 
PHOEBE: Yes, huh, I think so. I just... Oh! ... Huh!... Whoa! 
ROSS: Marcel! 
RACHEL: Marcel! 
ROSS: Marcel! Ah, this is ridiculous. We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone. He's, he's just gone. 
RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you don't know that. 
ROSS: Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the village... ... And now I have a broken foot! Thank you very much! 
RACHEL: Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry, like, a million times. What do you want me to do? Huh? What do you want, you want me to break my foot too? Is that it? OK, here, I'm gonna break my foot, right now, there... ... Ow! Oh god, oh my god! There, are you happy now? 
ROSS: Yeah. Yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign, hey, I don't miss Marcel any more! 
RACHEL: You know? It's not like I did this on purpose... 
ROSS: No, no, no. No, no. This is just vintage "Rachel". I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in "Rachel Land", doing your "Rachel Thing", totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to peoples feelings, and you... 
RACHEL: Ross. 
ROSS: I don't even want to hear it... No you're always... 
RACHEL: Ross! 
ROSS: Oh, forget it, OK? 
RACHEL: ROSS! 
ROSS: What, what, what? 
RACHEL: Hey! 
ROSS: Hey! Bananaman! 
PHOEBE: Oh. This is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea! 
ROSS: Hi! Did you order some bananas? 
HECKLES: What about it? 
ROSS: Give me my monkey back! 
HECKLES: I don't have a monkey. 
RACHEL: Then what's with all the bananas? 
HECKLES: Potassium. 
ROSS: Marcel? Marcel? OK. Where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? 
ROSS: Marcel! What have you done to him? 
HECKLES: That's my monkey. That's Patty. Patty the Monkey. 
ROSS: Are you insane? Come here Marcel, come on. 
HECKLES: Come on Patty. 
ROSS: Come here Marcel. 
HECKLES: Come here Patty. 
LOUISA: Here monkey! Here monkey! Here monkey! . Gotcha! 
ROSS: OK. Give me my monkey back! 
HECKLES: That's my monkey. 
LOUISA: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge. 
HECKLES: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine. You can send it back whenever. 
ROSS: Alright. I want my monkey! 
LOUISA: No! 
RACHEL: Oh, come on, Louisa. 
LOUISA: Sorry Prom Queen. 
ROSS: You had to be a bitch in high school. You couldn't have been fat! 
RACHEL: Alright, look, OK. In high school, I was the Prom Queen, and I was the Homecoming Queen, and the class president, and you... were also there. If you take this monkey, I will loose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. Come on Louisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here. Take it! 
LOUISA: ... No! 
RACHEL: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart? 
ROSS: Hey, It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it... or we can leave it on for now. That's fine... 
RACHEL: You know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit! 
ROSS: Listen. I'm... I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, you know, I just... 
RACHEL: Oh Ross, come on. No, no, it was my fault. I almost lost your... 
ROSS: No, no. Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, you know, you, you, you were great... Hey, we, er, we still have that, er, that bottle of wine... You in the mood for something grape? 
RACHEL: Sure. That'll be good. 
ROSS: Alright. Er (Gets wine, glasses, and turns down the lights...... The, er, the neighbours must be vacuuming! Well, er, so long as we're here, and, er, not on the subject, erm, I was thinking about, er, how mad we got at each other... before... and, erm, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, er, how we... 
BARRY: Rachel! 
RACHEL: Barry? 
BARRY: I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you... 
RACHEL: ! 
ROSS: !... We have got to start locking that door! 
MONICA: This is me in "The Sound of Music"... You see the Von-Trapp kids? 
PHOEBE: No. 
MONICA: That's because I'm in front of them! 
CHANDLER: Wow. I thought that was an Alp! 
MONICA: Well, high school was not my favourite time. 
JOEY: I don't know. I loved high school. You know, it was just, like, four years of parties, and dating, and sex... 
CHANDLER: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would have involved a major lifestyle choice! 
MONICA: Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?..... 
PHOEBE: Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my butt cheek is waking up! Oh! 
JOEY: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number? 
MONICA: I have no idea. But look how much they spent! 
RACHEL: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. 
MONICA: I know. It's just such reckless spending. 
ROSS: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. 
CHANDLER: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop. 
MONICA: That's me. 
PHOEBE: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! 
ROSS: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel- 
RACHEL: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him. 
MONICA: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. 
ROSS: What? It's, it's just a phase. 
CHANDLER: Well, that's what we said about Joey... 
ROSS: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. 
RACHEL: Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey! 
ROSS: What? 
RACHEL: Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious. 
RACHEL: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing. 
MONICA: This woman's living my life. 
RACHEL: What? 
MONICA: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. 
RACHEL: You're not an artist. 
MONICA: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. 
RACHEL: Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things. 
MONICA: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we. 
RACHEL: Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'... 
MONICA: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School? 
RACHEL: Nooo... 
MONICA: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. 
CHANDLER: How about Joey... Pepponi? 
JOEY: No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. 
CHANDLER: Joey... Switzerland? 
JOEY: Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not. 
CHANDLER: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin? 
JOEY: Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. 
CHANDLER: Well, it does not ring a bell with me... 
JOEY: Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. 
CHANDLER: Might wanna try Joseph. 
JOEY: Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! 
CHANDLER: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. 
RACHEL: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hey. 
MONICA: Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were. 
PHOEBE: What are you doing? 
MONICA: Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. 
RACHEL: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card? 
MONICA: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is. 
RACHEL: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing. 
PHOEBE: This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONICA, DON'T DO IT!! ...Thank you. 
MONICA: What d'you think? 
PHOEBE: Lotsa things. 
RACHEL: Which one do you think she is? 
TEACHER: May I help you? 
MONICA: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. 
TEACHER: You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there. 
RACHEL: What does she mean? 
PHOEBE: I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. 
MONICA: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? 
TEACHER: People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! 
RACHEL: She could be you. 
TEACHER: Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight... 
MONICA: Okay, I'm not getting this! 
PHOEBE: I'm totally getting it! 
MONICA: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? 
RACHEL: What? You just click when they click. 
TEACHER: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. 
PHOEBE: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. 
MONICA: Great. It's gym class all over again. 
PHOEBE AND RACHEL: Aww. 
TEACHER: Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me. 
MONICA: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. 
WOMAN: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl? 
TEACHER: She's your partner. 
WOMAN: Hi. I'm Monica. 
MONICA: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana. 
WOMAN : Monana? 
MONICA: Yeah. It's Dutch. 
FAKE MONICA: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. 
MONICA: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch. 
TEACHER: And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight... 
ROSS: Hi. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hey. 
JOEY: Where've you been? 
ROSS: At the vet. 
CHANDLER: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? 
ROSS: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. 
JOEY: Hey! He beat ya. 
ROSS: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. 
CHANDLER: So what does this mean? 
ROSS: I'm gonna have to give him up. 
JOEY: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks! 
CHANDLER: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? 
ROSS: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg. 
JOEY: Isn't there any way you can keep him? 
ROSS: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo. 
JOEY: How do you get a monkey into a zoo? 
CHANDLER: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. 
ROSS: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo. 
PHOEBE: Hey. We found her, we found the girl. 
CHANDLER: What? 
JOEY: Did you call the cops? 
RACHEL: Nope. We took her to lunch. 
CHANDLER: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. 
ROSS: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer. 
MONICA: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit. 
ROSS: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. 
CHANDLER: ...Take off their hats! 
PHOEBE: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke. 
RACHEL: No way. No way did you do this. 
FAKE MONICA: Monana was very brave. 
MONICA: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! 
FAKE MONICA: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts... 
MONICA: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! 
RACHEL: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. 
FAKE MONICA: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show. 
MONICA: 'Scuse me? 
FAKE MONICA: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say? 
MONICA: Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class. 
FAKE MONICA: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background. 
MONICA: What? 
FAKE MONICA: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? 
MONICA: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. 
FAKE MONICA: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society? 
MONICA: Uh-huh. 
FAKE MONICA: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back'. And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. 
MONICA: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. 
ROSS: Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. 
PHOEBE: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. 
ROSS: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him? 
RACHEL: Oh, somebody will. 
JOEY: You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? 
CHANDLER: You're kidding. 
JOEY: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! 
CHANDLER: Y'know, you'd think I would've. 
JOEY: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be? 
PHOEBE: ...Flame Boy. 
ROSS: Where exactly is your zoo? 
DR. BALDHARA: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? 
ROSS: Yes. 
DR. BALDHARA: Does he, uh, fight with other animals? 
ROSS: Nono, he's, he's very docile. 
DR. BALDHARA: Even if he were... cornered? 
ROSS: Well I, I don't know. Why? 
DR. BALDHARA: Uh, how is he at handling small objects? 
ROSS: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... 
DR. BALDHARA: How about a hammer, or a small blade? 
ROSS: Why- why- why would he need a blade? 
DR. BALDHARA: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. 
CHANDLER AND JOEY: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego. 
JOEY: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing- 
CHANDLER: -He's in. 
ROSS: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! 
DR. BALDHARA: You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. 
MONICA: Yo- hooo! 
RACHEL: Where the hell've you been? 
MONICA: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party. 
RACHEL: Are you drunk?! 
MONICA: Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk. 
RACHEL: Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... 
RACHEL: Monica? Monica! 
MONICA: Water rules! 
RACHEL: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work? 
MONICA: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today. 
RACHEL: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you! 
MONICA: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana! 
RACHEL: Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. 
MONICA: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. 
RACHEL: What? 
MONICA: They've arrested Monica. 
MONICA: Hi. 
FAKE MONICA: Hey. 
MONICA: How are you? 
FAKE MONICA: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How- how did you know I was here? 
MONICA: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. 
FAKE MONICA: That I was not expecting. 
MONICA: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. 
FAKE MONICA: Oh. Thanks. 
MONICA: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theatre! 
FAKE MONICA: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'. 
MONICA: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? 
FAKE MONICA: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus? 
MONICA: Well, not... worried, just... wondering. 
FAKE MONICA: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are. 
MONICA: Not necessarily... 
FAKE MONICA: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing. 
MONICA: Um, I'm not actually Amish. 
FAKE MONICA: Really? Then why are you like that? 
TEACHER: You by the door. In or out? 
MONICA: In. 
TEACHER: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong! 
MONICA: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it! 
PA: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A. 
PHOEBE: Okay. Goodbye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the 'plane. 
ROSS: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. 
PHOEBE: Oh! 
CHANDLER: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn. 
JOEY: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. 
ROSS: Just, just say what you feel. 
JOEY: Marcel, I'm hungry. 
ROSS: That was good. 
RACHEL: Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the 'plane. 
ROSS: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. 
ALL: Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. 
ROSS: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him. 
ACTOR: Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek... 
CASTING DIRECTOR #1: That's fine, thank you. 
CASTING DIRECTOR #2: Next. 
JOEY: Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio. 
CASTING DIRECTOR #2: Name? 
JOEY: Holden McGroin. 
MONICA: Tell him. 
RACHEL: No. 
PHOEBE: Tell him, tell him. 
MONICA: Just...please tell him. 
RACHEL: Shut up! 
CHANDLER: Tell me what? 
MONICA: Look at you, you won't even look at him. 
CHANDLER: Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me. 
RACHEL: All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were... 
PHOEBE: Doing it on this table. 
CHANDLER: Wow! 
JOEY: Exellent dream score. 
ROSS: Why, why, why would you dream that? 
CHANDLER: More importantly, was I any good? 
RACHEL: Well, you were pretty damnedy good. 
CHANDLER: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
RACHEL: Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. 
ROSS: I love it, when we share. 
CHANDLER: You're okay there? 
ROSS: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream. 
CHANDLER: I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and I was somebody else's subconscious. 
CHANDLER: Hi Rachel. 
RACHEL: Get off. 
PHOEBE: Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press? 
JOEY: I don't know. What are you wearing? 
ROSS: Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press? 
PHOEBE: Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients. 
CHANDLER: Pirates again? 
PHOEBE: No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop". And they are. 
JOEY: Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. 
CHANDLER: Thanks Joey, that's a good idea. 
PHOEBE: What... I could, I could do it. What is it? 
CHANDLER: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs reduced. It's a whole big boob story. 
PHOEBE: I could be a secretary. 
CHANDLER: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day. 
PHOEBE: I could do that. 
RACHEL: What are you playing with? 
ROSS: Oh, it's my new beeper. 
JOEY: What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? 
MONICA: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' 
ROSS: No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO. 
CHANDLER: A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid. 
MONICA: All right, I'll see you guys later. 
RACHEL: Off to see young Ethan? 
MONICA: Thank you. 
JOEY: How young is young Ethan? Young? 
MONICA: He's... our age. 
CHANDLER: When we were? 
MONICA: Okay, he's a senior in college. 
ROSS: College? 
JOEY: Whoa! 
CHANDLER: And this manchild has no problem with how old you are? 
MONICA: No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22. 
ALL: What? 
MONICA: Oh, I can't pass for 22? 
PHOEBE: Well, maybe 25-26. 
MONICA: I am 26. 
PHOEBE: There you go. 
CHANDLER: Can you hear that? 
PHOEBE: Yeah? 
CHANDLER: See That'll stop when you pick up the phone. 
PHOEBE: Oh. Uh, I'm on. 
PHOEBE: Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now. 
CHANDLER: I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops. 
PHOEBE: Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye. 
CHANDLER: What? 
PHOEBE: Ross says hi. 
CHANDLER: Ah! 
PHOEBE: This is so fun. All right, what do we do now? 
CHANDLER: Well, now, I actually have to get to work. 
PHOEBE: Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
PHOEBE: All right. Bye bye. 
CHANDLER: Bye bye. 
PHOEBE: Whatcha doin'? 
CHANDLER: Ooh. 
MONICA: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control? 
RACHEL: Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh. 
MONICA: What? 
RACHEL: Could tonight be the Night? 
MONICA: I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things. 
RACHEL: So, did you shave your legs? 
MONICA: Yeah. 
RACHEL: Aha! 
JOEY: Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean... 
ROSS: Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time. 
JOEY: All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. 
ROSS: Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr' is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services. 
JOEY: Services? Oh, services. 
ROSS: Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye. 
JOEY: Hey, hey. How was the first day? 
PHOEBE: Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice. 
CHANDLER: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me. 
PHOEBE: No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you. 
CHANDLER: Why not? 
PHOEBE: Oh, because, you know... they don't like you. 
CHANDLER: What? 
PHOEBE: I thought you knew that. 
CHANDLER: Noho. Why doesn't they like me? 
PHOEBE: Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone. 
CHANDLER: What are you talking about? 
PHOEBE: Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing". 
CHANDLER: I can't belive it. 
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah. They even do you. 
CHANDLER: They do me? 
PHOEBE: You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?' 
CHANDLER: I don't sound like that. 
ROSS: Oh, oh Chandler... 
JOEY: Oh... Yeah, you do. 
ROSS: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.' 
JOEY: My scones. 
PHOEBE, JOEY &AMP; ROSS: 'My scones.' 
CHANDLER: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true. 
CHANDLER: That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up! 
MONICA: Did not. 
ETHAN: I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place wher crimes happen. 
MONICA: How was that possible? 
ETHAN: Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' You know, I just kept thinking: why do people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go. 
MONICA: Okay. 
ETHAN: Okay. 
MONICA: Unless-- 
ETHAN: What? 
MONICA: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so... 
ETHAN: Yeah, I'd really like that. 
ETHAN: Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know. 
MONICA: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat'? 
ETHAN: Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh... 
MONICA: Ethan-- 
ETHAN: Yeah? 
MONICA: Are you a virgin? 
ETHAN: Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person. 
MONICA: Really? 
ETHAN: Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right? 
ETHAN: Wow! 
MONICA: You keep saying that. 
ETHAN: You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practise it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. 
MONICA: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to. 
ETHAN: Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong. 
MONICA: No no. Nothing wrong about that. 
ETHAN: Oh. 
MONICA: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. 
ETHAN: Huh! 
MONICA: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. 
ETHAN: Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said. 
MONICA: You're not a senior? 
ETHAN: Oh, I'm a senior... in High School. 
MONICA: Ok...ay. 
MONICA: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial. 
ETHAN: I just had sex. 
MONICA: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? 
ETHAN: Well, you never told me how old you were. 
MONICA: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? 
ETHAN: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'-- 
MONICA: Don't say it. 
ETHAN: --in love with you. 
MONICA: Really? 
ETHAN: Sorry. 
MONICA: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. I'm Joan Collins. 
ETHAN: Who? 
ROSS: Okay, Andr' should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way. 
CHANDLER: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream. 
RACHEL: No, forget it. 
CHANDLER: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy? 
RACHEL: All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too. 
JOEY: All right. 
ROSS: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there. 
RACHEL: No. 
ROSS: You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything? 
RACHEL: No, it was just the three of us. 
ROSS: Huh! 
JOEY: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler? 
RACHEL: He, he, he. You know what? 
JOEY: What? 
RACHEL: There were times when it wasn't even me. 
PHOEBE: That is so sweet, you guys. 
ROSS, RACHEL &AMP; PHOEBE: Hey, Mon. 
RACHEL: Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? 
ALL: Mon! 
MONICA: What? 
RACHEL: Ethan called again. 
MONICA: Oh. 
ROSS: Are you not seeing him anymore? 
MONICA: No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out. 
CHANDLER: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym. 
RACHEL: I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. 
JOEY: Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest "Power Ranger" is? 
ROSS: Oh, yeah. 
MONICA: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? 
JOEY, CHANDLER &AMP; ROSS: Sorry. 
ROSS: It's morphin time! 
JOEY: Stegosaurus! 
CHANDLER: Tyrannosaurus! 
PHOEBE: Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool! 
RACHEL: Where are you going? 
PHOEBE: Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people. 
CHANDLER: Work people? Nobody told me. 
PHOEBE: No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance. 
CHANDLER: You know, I don't get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person. 
PHOEBE: Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are. 
CHANDLER: You think I should? 
PHOEBE: I really do, yeah. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Okay. 
CHANDLER: Okay. 
PHOEBE: Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss. 
CHANDLER: I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory". 
PHOEBE: You were great. But they still made fun of you. 
CHANDLER: What? 
PHOEBE: You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss", "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss", "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing" 
CHANDLER: Then, I don't get it. 
PHOEBE: Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss. 
CHANDLER: They do? 
PHOEBE: Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore. 
CHANDLER: I just wan't to-- 
PHOEBE: No, but you can't. 
CHANDLER: But I just wa-- 
PHOEBE: Uh uh. 
MONICA: Aren't you gonna-- 
ROSS: Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it. 
JOEY: What about Andr'? 
ROSS: Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. 
ETHAN: Hey. 
MONICA: That was gonna be my opener. 
RACHEL: Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom? 
ROSS: I thought that was just a rumour. 
RACHEL: True story. 
JOEY: They're here allready? 
ETHAN: All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk , we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay I have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great. 
MONICA: It was. 
ETHAN: Then, what's the problem? 
MONICA: Ethan, it's um... it's icky. 
ETHAN: Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky? 
MONICA: This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really-- 
ETHAN: No, don't say it. 
MONICA: --love you. 
ROSS: Are you're hands still wet? 
JOEY: Uh, moist, yeah. 
RACHEL: Let's dry 'em again. 
GERSTON: Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler. 
SANTOS: Hello, Mr. Bing. 
PETRIE: Loved your "Stevie Wonder" last night. 
CHANDLER: Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock. 
SANTOS: Sure. 
GERSTON: No problem. 
CHANDLER: You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache? 
PHOEBE: Petrie. 
CHANDLER: Petrie, right, right. Okay, somebody's gonna be working this weekend. 
RACHEL: Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross. 
RACHEL: Ross? 
ROSS: I'm here.

ROSS: Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. 
ROSS: What are you doing? We're going to a hospital. 
RACHEL: What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. 
ROSS: Joey, get out of the fridge. 
JOEY: All right, all right. 
ROSS: What is that? 
JOEY: For the ride. 
CHANDLER: Yeah, like in a cab-- 
ROSS: Save it. 
CHANDLER: Okay, hating this.

MONICA: I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew. 
ROSS: That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on. 
JOEY: All right, I'm going. I'm going. 
CHANDLER: Here we go, here we go. 
RACHEL: Rossy, Rossy. 
 ROSS: She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here. 
MONICA: I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet? 
ROSS: I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucous plug. 
JOEY: Do we have to know about that? 
MONICA: Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby? 
JOEY: I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars. 
CHANDLER: Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's. 
ROSS: God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab. 
RACHEL: Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction. What, it's ok when Chandler does it? 
CHANDLER: You have to pick your moments. 
PHOEBE: Did I miss it, did I miss it? 
ROSS: She's not even here yet. 
MONICA: What's with the guitar? 
PHOEBE: I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical. 
ROSS: Where the hell have you been? 
SUSAN: We stopped at the gift shop. 
CAROL: I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky. 
ROSS: Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys. 
CHANDLER: I used to have that bumper sticker. You see what I mean. 
ROSS: Stopped for a chunky. 
CAROL: Let it go, Ross. 
SUSAN: I got an extra one. You want this? 
ROSS: No. 
FRANZBLAU: Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing? 
ROSS: Dr. Franzblau, hi. 
FRANZBLAU: So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions? 
CAROL: Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus. 
SUSAN: They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds. 
ROSS: 59 seconds. Quartz, ha. 
SUSAN: Swiss quartz, ha, ha. 
CAROL: Am I allowed to drink anything. 
FRANZBLAU: Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station. 
ROSS: I'll get it. 
SUSAN: No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back. 
ROSS: I got it--I'm getting it! 
RACHEL: Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips. 
CAROL: Thanks. 
RACHEL: And if you need anything else, I--do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm uh Rachel Green. I'm Carol's ex-husband's sister's roommate. 
FRANZBLAU: It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's brother's ex-wife's obstetrician. 
RACHEL: Oh, that's funny! 
MONICA: I want a baby. 
CHANDLER: Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow. 
MONICA: Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee. 
CHANDLER: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that. 
JOEY: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too. 
LYDIA: Knick fan? 
JOEY: Oh, yeah. 
LYDIA: Oh, boy, do they suck. 
JOEY: Hey, listen, lady....whoa. 
LYDIA: Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat. 
JOEY: Oh yeah? And who do you like? 
LYDIA: The Celtics. 
JOEY: The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, all right? 
LYDIA: Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You...waah! 
JOEY: Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father! 
LYDIA: There is no father. 
JOEY: Oh, oh, oh, sorry. 
LYDIA: Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm...oh! 
JOEY: Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here. 
LYDIA: Ok. 
PHOEBE: They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry... Thanks, Ross. 
ROSS: Yeah. I'm paying you to stop. 
PHOEBE: Ok. 
MONICA: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute. No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two? 
CHANDLER: You'll get one. 
MONICA: Oh yeah? When? 
CHANDLER: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? 
MONICA: Why won't I be married when I'm 40? 
CHANDLER: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. 
MONICA: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? 
CHANDLER: No, no, no. 
MONICA: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me? 
CHANDLER: Uh, uh. 
MONICA: Well? 
CHANDLER: Dear god! This parachute is a knapsack! 
RACHEL: Hey. 
PHOEBE: Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress. 
MONICA: Did you go home and change? 
RACHEL: Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by? 
MONICA: No, I haven't seen him. 
RACHEL: Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him? 
CHANDLER: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was like your father a doctor? 
RACHEL: Yeah, why? 
CHANDLER: No reason. 
LYDIA: Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who? Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone. 
JOEY: HI, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello? 
LYDIA: She's not much of a phone person. 
JOEY: Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know? 
LYDIA: Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no. 
JOEY: Ok, look, maybe I should just go. 
LYDIA: Maybe you should. 
JOEY: Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team. 
LYDIA: Oh, that is so not true. 
JOEY: Oh, it is. 
LYDIA: It isn't. 
JOEY: It is. 
LYDIA: Isn't! 
ROSS: Breathe. 
SUSAN: Breathe. 
ROSS: Breathe. 
SUSAN: Breathe. 
ROSS: Breathe. 
SUSAN: Breathe. 
CAROL: You're gonna kill me! 
ROSS: 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12... 
CAROL: Count faster. 
SUSAN: It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie. 
ROSS: Who the hell is Jordie? 
SUSAN: Your son. 
ROSS: No no no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. 
CAROL: Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. 
ROSS: What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie, we just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco. 
CAROL: Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. 
ROSS: I got it. 
SUSAN: I got it. 
ROSS: I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. 
SUSAN: No, you don't. 
CAROL: All right, that's it. I want both of you out. 
ROSS: Why? 
SUSAN: He started it! 
ROSS: No, you started it. 
SUSAN: You did! 
CAROL: I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. 
ROSS: But-- 
CAROL: Now go! 
ROSS: Thanks a lot. 
SUSAN: See what you did. 
ROSS: Yeah, listen-- 
CAROL: OUT! 
NURSE: Breathe, breathe, breathe... 
LYDIA: Oh, no. 
JOEY: Ew! What is that? Something exploded! 
NURSE: It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you? 
JOEY: Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? 
NURSE: Breathe, breathe, breathe. 
ROSS: Please. This is so your fault. 
SUSAN: How, how is this my fault? 
ROSS: Look, Carol never threw me out of her room before you came along. 
SUSAN: Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. 
ROSS: You tryin' to be clever? 
SUSAN: You know what your problem is? You are so threatened by me. 
ROSS: Oh, I'm threatened by you? 
SUSAN: Yes. 
PHOEBE: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! 
ROSS: Yeah, Susan. 
PHOEBE: Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? 
ALL: Help! 
ROSS: I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow. 
CAROL: Are they here yet? 
RACHEL: No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok? 
CAROL: Ok. 
RACHEL: Ok? 
CAROL: Ok. 
RACHEL: Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating. 
FRANZBLAU: It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear. 
JOEY: Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's-- I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push! 
SUSAN: What're you gonna do, suck the door open? 
ROSS: Help! Help! 
PHOEBE: They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...la la la la la la. 
SUSAN/ROSS: Help! 
MONICA: Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. 
CHANDLER: Where have you been? 
JOEY: Oh, just had a baby. 
CHANDLER: Mazeltov! 
FRANZBLAU: I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone? 
RACHEL: No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you? 
FRANZBLAU: No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me. 
RACHEL: Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors. 
FRANZBLAU: No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do. 
RACHEL: Oh. 
FRANZBLAU: I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do? 
RACHEL: I'm a waitress. 
FRANZBLAU: Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, if I see one more cup of coffee... 
RACHEL: Yeah, gotcha. 
FRANZBLAU: I'm gonna go check up on your friend. 
RACHEL: Ok. That's fine. 
LYDIA: So how did you know I was even here? 
GUY: Your mom called me. So is this her? 
LYDIA: No, this is a loaner. 
GUY: I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. 
LYDIA: I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. so, did you see who won the game? 
GUY: Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck. 
LYDIA: Yeah, they're not so bad. 
ROSS: Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be like the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. 
SUSAN: The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. 
ROSS: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok, where does that leave me? 
SUSAN: You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no Lesbian Lover Day. 
ROSS: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. 
PHOEBE: This is so great. 
ROSS: You wanna explain that? 
PHOEBE: I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting. 
CAROL: Where are they? 
MONICA: I'm sure they'll be here soon. 
RACHEL: Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this. 
JOEY: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. 
CHANDLER: You are really frightening me. Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple? 
FRANZBLAU: All right, ten centimeters, here we go. 
NURSE: All right, honey, time to start pushing. 
CHANDLER: But they're not here yet! 
FRANZBLAU: I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them. 
CAROL: Oh, god. 
ROSS: Ok, got the vent open. 
PHOEBE: Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben to the rescue. 
ROSS: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben. 
SUSAN: What do you see? 
PHOEBE: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. 
ROSS: Pheebs, It's open! It's open! 
JANITOR:: Wait! You forgot your legs! 
ALL: Push, push! 
ROSS: We're here! 
CAROL: Where have you been? 
ROSS: Long story, honey. 
FRANZBLAU: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need--Excuse me, could I have this? 
NURSE: All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go! 
ALL: Good luck! 
CHANDLER: Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner? 
NURSE: Out! 
FRANZBLAU: All right, he's crowning. Here he comes. 
ROSS: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this? 
CAROL: You're not helping! 
FRANZBLAU: You're doing great, you're doing fine. Hello! 
ROSS: Oh, sorry. 
SUSAN: What do you see? What do you see? 
ROSS: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person. 
SUSAN: Oh, look at that. 
CAROL: What does he look like? 
ROSS: Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jello. 
CAROL: Really? 
PHOEBE: You guys, he's beautiful! 
ROSS: Oh, thanks, Pheebs! 
SUSAN: No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. 
ROSS: How 'bout Ben? 
SUSAN: I like Ben. 
CAROL: Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? 
ROSS: We uh, we just cooked it up. 
SUSAN: That's what we were off doing. 
MONICA: Hi. 
ROSS: Hey. 
MONICA: Can we come in? 
ROSS: I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody. 
PHOEBE: Susan, he looks just like you. 
SUSAN: Thanks. 
RACHEL: Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these. 
CHANDLER: I know, I still am one of these. 
MONICA: Ross, can I? 
ROSS: The head, the head. You gotta... 
MONICA: Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum. 
ROSS: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. 
CHANDLER: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. 
MONICA: He is so amazing. 
RACHEL: Oh, I know. Look at him. 
JOEY: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name. 
PHOEBE: Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes. 
JOEY: He doesn't do much, does he? 
ROSS: No, this is pretty much it. 
RACHEL: You guys wanna get some coffee? 
ALL: Yeah. 
ROSS: All right, I'll see you guys later. 
PHOEBE: Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again. 
ROSS: And here's little Ben nodding off... 
MNCA: Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy! 
PHOE: Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut! 
RACH: Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over! 
ROSS: That would be nice. 
RACH: Pardon? 
CHAN: Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. 
JOEY: Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. 
CHAN: Oh, yeah right, OK, including the waffles last week, you now owe me...seventeen jillion dollars. 
JOEY: I will, really. I'll pay you back this time. 
CHAN: ... And where's this money coming from? 
JOEY: Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research. 
ROSS: What kind of research? 
JOEY: Oh, just, y'know.... science. 
ROSS: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. 
JOEY: ... It's a fertility study. 
MNCA: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time. 
JOEY: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. 
ROSS: Hey. 
PHOE: Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist! 
MNCA: Alright, we got the plates, we got the buns... 
PHOE: We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... 
CHAN: Men are here. 
JOEY: We make fire. Cook meat. 
CHAN: Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. 
MNCA/PHOE: Ewww! 
MNCA: Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late. 
JOEY: Oh, OK. 
PHOE: So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone? 
JOEY: I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great. 
MNCA: Yeah? What does she think of your little science project? 
JOEY: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? 
MNCA: Man's got a point. 
JOEY: Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. 
CHAN: Crazy bitch. 
JOEY: Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean. 
MNCA: Joey... we always know what you mean. 
PHOE: Hey. 
MNCA: Hey. 
ROSS: Hey. 
PHOE: How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last? 
ROSS: I'm going to China. 
PHOE: Jeez, you say one thing, and... 
MNCA: You're going to China? 
ROSS: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's-- it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me... 
PHOE: Oh, let me see! 
ROSS: : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me? 
MNCA: Yeah. 
PHOE: Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun. 
ROSS: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. 
MNCA: Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. 
ROSS: Oh. Hey, who's Carl? 
MNCA: You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. 
ROSS: No. 
PHOE: Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the-- 
ROSS: At the coffeehouse, right. 
PHOE: So you do know who he is! Sorry. 
ROSS: OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys. 
PHOE: Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. 
ROSS: Hi. 
JOEY: Hey! 
CHAN: Hey! 
ROSS: ....I have to go to China. 
JOEY: The country? 
ROSS: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is? 
CHAN: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no. 
ROSS: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight. 
JOEY: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? 
CHAN: Forget about her. 
JOEY: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. 
CHAN: Course there, they just call it food. 
ROSS: Yeah... I guess. I don't--I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? 
JOEY: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. 
ROSS: I know. 
JOEY: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. 
CHAN: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. 
MELN: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.' 
JOEY: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. 
CHAN: Ooooh. 
MNCA: OK, how does everybody like their burgers? 
RACH: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. 
MNCA: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up? 
JOEY: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I-- 
JOEY: Then you do. Heh, heh. 
MNCA: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her? 
JOEY: What do you mean? 
MNCA: Y'know, just be there for her. 
JOEY: Not following you. 
MNCA: Think about it. 
RACH: OK, I'm guessing this is from... 
RACH: Well, thank you, Melanie. 
CHAN: OK, this one right here is from me. 
RACH: OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! 
RACH: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book! 
PHOE: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss! 
JOEY: : That book got me through some tough times. 
MELN: There is a little child inside this man! 
CHAN: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. 
RACH: Who's this from? 
CHAN: Oh, that's Ross's. 
RACH: Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered. 
PHOE: Remembered what? 
RACH: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! 
CHAN: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? 
PHOE: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. 
MNCA: I can't believe he did this. 
CHAN: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? 
RACH: What did you just say? 
CHAN: ahem... um... Crystal duck. 
RACH: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part? 
CHAN: F-hah.... flennin.... 
RACH: Oh.... my God. 
CHAN: Oh, no no no no no.... 
JOEY: That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. 
RACH: I mean, this is unbelievable. 
PHOE: I know. This is really, really huge. 
CHAN: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. 
PHOE: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again. 
CHAN: OK, is there a mute button on this woman? 
MNCA: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea? 
RACH: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me? 
JOEY: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. 
RACH: Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. 
CHAN: H-He's in China! 
JOEY: The country. 
MNCA: No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes. 
CHAN: What about the time difference? 
MNCA: From here to the airport? 
CHAN: Yes! You're never gonna make it! 
MNCA: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him? 
RACH: I-I-I don't know. 
CHAN: Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
JOEY: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. 
MNCA: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. 
RACH: I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him. 
PHOE: Here, look, alright, does this help? 
RACH: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. 
CHAN: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! 
ROSS: 
FLGT: Alright! 
ROSS: Ni-chou chi-ma! 
RACH: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... 
FLGT: Hi! 
RACH: Hi. 
FLGT: May I see your boarding pass? 
RACH: Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. 
FLGT: Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. 
RACH: No, I know, but I--he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just... 
FLGT: No no no! Federal regulations! 
RACH: OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important. 
FLGT: Alright. What's the message? 
RACH: Uh... I don't know. 
FLGT: Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you. 
MAN: What? 
FLGT: It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back. 
MAN: : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze. 
MELN: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute! 
JOEY: Heh, heh. It was nothin'. 
MELN: Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! 
JOEY: Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn. 
MELN: M-Me again? 
JOEY: Sure! Why not? 
MELN: Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow. 
MELN: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be. 
JOEY: How do you mean? 
MELN: I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman. 
MNCA: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out? 
RACH: I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. 
PHOE/MNCA: Sure. 
RACH: I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great. 
MNCA: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! 
PHOE: Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. 
MNCA: Another good point. 
PHOE: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed. 
RACH: Huh? 
PHOE: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out? 
MNCA: Why isn't it working out? 
RACH: I don't know... sometimes it doesn't. 
MNCA: Is he not cute enough for you? 
RACH: No! 
MNCA: Does he not make enough money? 
RACH: No, I'm just.... 
PHOE: Maybe there's someone else. 
RACH: Wha-- 
MNCA: Is there? Is there someone else? 
RACH: No! There is.. there is noone else! 
MNCA: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? 
CHAN: Hey, big-- 
JOEY: Shhhh! 
CHAN: --spender. 
JOEY: She's still asleep. 
CHAN: So how'd it go? 
JOEY: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? 
CHAN: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. 
JOEY: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! 
CHAN: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. 
JOEY: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. 
CHAN: I didn't know you had another level. 
JOEY: I know! Neither did I! 
MNCA: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present? 
RACH: Yeah. 
MNCA: Oh, from who? 
RACH: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me. 
MNCA: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B? 
RACH: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this--this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea. 
MNCA: Oh, why? 
RACH: Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna-- 
MNCA: No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! 
RACH: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... 
MNCA: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise. 
RACH: Who is it? 
VOICE: It's me, Carl. 
RACH: C'mon up. 
MNCA: Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. 
JOEY: Seven hundred bucks! 
CHAN: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? 
JOEY: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. 
CHAN: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? 
JOEY: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? 
CARL: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! 
ROSS: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. 
RACH: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. 
ROSS: Fine, just stop thinking about me. 
ROSS: Can't do it, can you? 
RACH: So I'm thinking about you. So what? 
ROSS: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway? 
RACH: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy.... 
CARL: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! 
ROSS: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. 
RACH: Ross, it's too hard. 
ROSS: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 
RACH: Ross, you're like my best friend. 
ROSS: I know. 
RACH: If we broke up, and I lost you... 
ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up? 
RACH: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? 
ROSS: No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? 
RACH: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. 
ROSS: Well, start looking. 
RACH: Wow. 
CARL: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! 
RACH: Right! You're right! 
CARL: Heh... y'know? 
RACH: You know what? 
CARL: What? 
RACH: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I mean--I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. 
CARL: But... 
RACH: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. 
MAN: For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! 
ROSS: Oh, hey, hey, I got that. 
JULIE: Oh, thanks, sweetie. 
ROSS: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends. 
JULIE: Really? 
ROSS: Yeah. 
JULIE: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? 
ROSS: No, no, they will. I just... uh... 
ROSS/JULIE: Can't wait. 
ROSS: Come on, they're gonna love you.
