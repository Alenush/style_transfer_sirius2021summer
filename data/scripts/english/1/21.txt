ДЖОУИ: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number? 
МОНИКА: I have no idea. But look how much they spent! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. 
МОНИКА: I know. It's just such reckless spending. 
РОСС: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop. 
МОНИКА: That's me. 
ФИБИ: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! 
РОСС: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel- 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him. 
МОНИКА: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. 
РОСС: What? It's, it's just a phase. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's what we said about Joey... 
РОСС: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey! 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing. 
МОНИКА: This woman's living my life. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're not an artist. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things. 
МОНИКА: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'... 
МОНИКА: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo... 
МОНИКА: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about Joey... Pepponi? 
ДЖОУИ: No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey... Switzerland? 
ДЖОУИ: Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin? 
ДЖОУИ: Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it does not ring a bell with me... 
ДЖОУИ: Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Might wanna try Joseph. 
ДЖОУИ: Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were. 
ФИБИ: What are you doing? 
МОНИКА: Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card? 
МОНИКА: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing. 
ФИБИ: This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONICA, DON'T DO IT!! ...Thank you. 
МОНИКА: What d'you think? 
ФИБИ: Lotsa things. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Which one do you think she is? 
НЕДРУГ: May I help you? 
МОНИКА: Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. 
НЕДРУГ: You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What does she mean? 
ФИБИ: I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. 
МОНИКА: Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? 
НЕДРУГ: People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She could be you. 
НЕДРУГ: Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight... 
МОНИКА: Okay, I'm not getting this! 
ФИБИ: I'm totally getting it! 
МОНИКА: Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You just click when they click. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. 
ФИБИ: Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. 
МОНИКА: Great. It's gym class all over again. 
НЕДРУГ: Aww. 
НЕДРУГ: Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me. 
МОНИКА: Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. 
НЕДРУГ: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl? 
НЕДРУГ: She's your partner. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. I'm Monica. 
МОНИКА: Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana. 
НЕДРУГ: Monana? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. It's Dutch. 
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. 
МОНИКА: Um, Pennsylvania Dutch. 
НЕДРУГ: And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight... 
РОСС: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Where've you been? 
РОСС: At the vet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? 
РОСС: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! He beat ya. 
РОСС: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what does this mean? 
РОСС: I'm gonna have to give him up. 
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? 
РОСС: I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg. 
ДЖОУИ: Isn't there any way you can keep him? 
РОСС: No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo. 
ДЖОУИ: How do you get a monkey into a zoo? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. 
РОСС: Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo. 
ФИБИ: Hey. We found her, we found the girl. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Did you call the cops? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nope. We took her to lunch. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. 
РОСС: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit. 
РОСС: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ...Take off their hats! 
ФИБИ: Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No way. No way did you do this. 
НЕДРУГ: Monana was very brave. 
МОНИКА: It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! 
НЕДРУГ: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts... 
МОНИКА: ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show. 
МОНИКА: 'Scuse me? 
НЕДРУГ: There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say? 
МОНИКА: Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background. 
МОНИКА: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? 
МОНИКА: Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. 
НЕДРУГ: I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society? 
МОНИКА: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back'. And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. 
МОНИКА: Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. 
РОСС: Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. 
ФИБИ: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. 
РОСС: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, somebody will. 
ДЖОУИ: You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're kidding. 
ДЖОУИ: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, you'd think I would've. 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be? 
ФИБИ: ...Flame Boy. 
РОСС: Where exactly is your zoo? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? 
РОСС: Yes. 
НЕДРУГ: Does he, uh, fight with other animals? 
РОСС: Nono, he's, he's very docile. 
НЕДРУГ: Even if he were... cornered? 
РОСС: Well I, I don't know. Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, how is he at handling small objects? 
РОСС: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... 
НЕДРУГ: How about a hammer, or a small blade? 
РОСС: Why- why- why would he need a blade? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. 
НЕДРУГ: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego. 
ДЖОУИ: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing- 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: -He's in. 
РОСС: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! 
НЕДРУГ: You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. 
МОНИКА: Yo- hooo! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where the hell've you been? 
МОНИКА: Monica and I just crashed an embassy party. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you drunk?! 
МОНИКА: Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica? Monica! 
МОНИКА: Water rules! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work? 
МОНИКА: Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you! 
МОНИКА: No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. 
МОНИКА: Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: They've arrested Monica. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: How are you? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How- how did you know I was here? 
МОНИКА: Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. 
НЕДРУГ: That I was not expecting. 
МОНИКА: I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Thanks. 
МОНИКА: No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theatre! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'. 
МОНИКА: I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? 
НЕДРУГ: Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus? 
МОНИКА: Well, not... worried, just... wondering. 
НЕДРУГ: There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are. 
МОНИКА: Not necessarily... 
НЕДРУГ: Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing. 
МОНИКА: Um, I'm not actually Amish. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? Then why are you like that? 
НЕДРУГ: You by the door. In or out? 
МОНИКА: In. 
НЕДРУГ: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, but at least I'm doing it! 
НЕДРУГ: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Goodbye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the 'plane. 
РОСС: Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Oh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn. 
ДЖОУИ: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. 
РОСС: Just, just say what you feel. 
ДЖОУИ: Marcel, I'm hungry. 
РОСС: That was good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the 'plane. 
РОСС: Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. 
РОСС: Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek... 
НЕДРУГ: That's fine, thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Next. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio. 
НЕДРУГ: Name? 
ДЖОУИ: Holden McGroin.
