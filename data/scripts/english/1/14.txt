ДЖОУИ: I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you. 
РОСС: She barely knows me. We just live in the same building. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Any contact? 
РОСС: She lent me an egg once. 
ДЖОУИ: You're in! 
РОСС: Aw, right. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Ross. 
РОСС: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian--I don't think we need a third... 
ДЖОУИ: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks. 
РОСС: An egg? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it's winning. 
РОСС: I think it's insane. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend. 
ДЖОУИ: Think it'll work? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg. 
МОНИКА: You can not do this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do what, do what? 
МОНИКА: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy? 
ФИБИ: 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening, All right, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! 
МОНИКА: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night? 
ДЖОУИ: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... 
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a-- 
ДЖОУИ: Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', ch-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. 
РОСС: Hi. She said yes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: How do I look? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uh, I don't care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And what did you bring? 
НЕДРУГ: She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab small off my hands. Will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. 
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. Chandler: Calm down, calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months! 
ДЖОУИ: Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney. 
МОНИКА: Which one was Pete Carney? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He was the weeper. Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?" 
МОНИКА: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the- "I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people! 
МОНИКА: I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets. 
ФИБИ: I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch. 
МОНИКА: There's more beer, right? 
ФИБИ: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebes, this woman is voluntarily bald. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect. 
МОНИКА: Ok, well, what kind of ritual. 
ФИБИ: Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Or? 
ФИБИ: Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks. 
МОНИКА: Burning's good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. 
ДЖОУИ: Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? 
НЕДРУГ: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's ok. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. 
ДЖОУИ: We can't do that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? What can't you do? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? Uh, we might be leaving now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell me it's "you and me" we. 
ДЖОУИ: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, you can not do this to me. 
ДЖОУИ: You're right, I'm sorry. You're right. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please? 
ДЖОУИ: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I hope she throws up on you. So... 
НЕДРУГ: Just us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, what a crappy night! 
НЕДРУГ: Although, I have enjoyed the fact that uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me. How ya doin'? 
НЕДРУГ: So, do we have the best friends or what? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen tv? 
НЕДРУГ: I will go for that drink. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got it. Good woman, could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne? 
НЕДРУГ: Each. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know... 
НЕДРУГ: Happy Valentine's Day! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice. 
НЕДРУГ: Kiss me! 
МОНИКА: Oh, Chandler, sorry. Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Monica. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, well, this was very special. 
МОНИКА: Rache, come see who's out here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god. Janice, hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice is gonna go away now. 
МОНИКА: I'll be right back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey, look who it is. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, good, Joey's home now. 
НЕДРУГ: This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall. 
МОНИКА: Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? 
РОСС: I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. 
НЕДРУГ: That's funny. Who are they? 
РОСС: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her close, personal friend. 
НЕДРУГ: You mean they're lovers. 
РОСС: If you wanna put a label on it. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, uh, anything else I should know? 
РОСС: Nope, nope, that's it. Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo! 
ФИБИ: Ok, so now we need um sage branches and the sacramental wine. 
МОНИКА: All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca. 
ФИБИ: Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place. 
МОНИКА: Can we just start throwing things in? 
ФИБИ: Ok, yeah, ok. Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts. 
ФИБИ: Ok, and I have the uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah. 
МОНИКА: Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey he's wearing a sweater. 
МОНИКА: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Eww! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa. 
МОНИКА: Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure-- 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello, funny Valentine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, Just Janice. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna! 
ДЖОУИ: If you don't do it, I will. 
РОСС: Su, um, what do you do for a living? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, um, for the past few years I've been working...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. 
НЕДРУГ: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. 
РОСС: Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. 
НЕДРУГ: I guess. 
РОСС: Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. 
РОСС: Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major! 
НЕДРУГ: What do we got there? 
НЕДРУГ: A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture--Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief! 
МОНИКА: You know, it's a really funny story how this happened. 
НЕДРУГ: It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. 
НЕДРУГ: You're our third call tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. 
НЕДРУГ: I brought you something. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever. 
НЕДРУГ: I had them made special. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this, at least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out. 
НЕДРУГ: That's fine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is? 
НЕДРУГ: Mmm hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, you see, actually it is. 
НЕДРУГ: No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no I don't. 
НЕДРУГ: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did, but-- 
НЕДРУГ: You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Call me! 
НЕДРУГ: It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. 
РОСС: You did so. I swear, I swear-- How long has she been in the bathroom? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone. 
РОСС: Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years. 
НЕДРУГ: That could be it. 
РОСС: Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot. 
НЕДРУГ: Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny 
РОСС: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I love you too. But-- 
РОСС: No but, no but. 
НЕДРУГ: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you. 
РОСС: That's easy for you to say, you found one already. 
НЕДРУГ: All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. Not her. 
НЕДРУГ: We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, um, will you bring the truck? 
НЕДРУГ: I'll even let you ring the bell. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, my god. 
ФИБИ: See, there you go, the cleansing works! 
МОНИКА: They're nice guys. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, they're firemen guys. 
НЕДРУГ: You guys tell them you were married? 
НЕДРУГ: No way! 
НЕДРУГ: Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
