РОСС: Yeah, see, you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd, make myself omnipotent forever.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See, there's always one guy. If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
МОНИКА: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
ДЖОУИ: Probably kill myself!
МОНИКА: Excuse me?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
РОСС: Joey, uh OMnipotent.
ДЖОУИ: You are? Ross, I'm sorry.

РОСС: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
МОНИКА: What's going on with you?
ФИБИ: I got no sleep last night!
РОСС: Why?
ФИБИ: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
МОНИКА: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
ФИБИ: Thanks.

ФИБИ: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
МОНИКА: Ah, the other Jack.
ФИБИ: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, III know, I know I didn't love him.
ФИБИ: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like.
ФИБИ: Floopy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be, un-floopy.
