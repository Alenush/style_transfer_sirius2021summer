ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no no no, we're done.
НЕДРУГ: Stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
РОСС: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
ФИБИ: Ooh, this is cool it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And, we're done with the yogurt.
ФИБИ: Sorry.
МОНИКА: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
РОСС: Hello!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, poke a nose, mmm.
НЕДРУГ: Mma, Mma, Mmaah.
МОНИКА: So, did I hear Poconos?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
ФИБИ: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
МОНИКА: Yeah, that's a big step.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
РОСС: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be, flung by now?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally.
РОСС: nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
ДЖОУИ: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
ДЖОУИ: Need a new table.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You think?
НЕДРУГ: Hey hey, come on in!
РОСС: Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
НЕДРУГ: I'm pretty sure that it is.
НЕДРУГ: So, I got the results of the amnio today.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh?
НЕДРУГ: Totally and completely healthy!
РОСС: Oh, that's great, that is great!
РОСС: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
НЕДРУГ: Of course it's your friend Tanya.
НЕДРУГ: Don't you want to know about the sex?
НЕДРУГ: The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya, yaw.
НЕДРУГ: The sex of the baby, Ross.
РОСС: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh oh!
НЕДРУГ: Do you want to know?
РОСС: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hello Ross!
РОСС: Susan.
НЕДРУГ: So, so, did you hear?
РОСС: Yes, we did, everything's AOK!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's so. It really is do we know?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey hey, ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
НЕДРУГ: Mm-hmmm.
РОСС: Ok, what, what ok, what did we think it was going to be?
НЕДРУГ: It's a.
НЕДРУГ: No, no,no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
НЕДРУГ: Well, thanks for the books.
РОСС: No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan.
НЕДРУГ: All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
НЕДРУГ: Hello?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
ДЖОУИ: That's the rule.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
ДЖОУИ: How'd you get to that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio.
ДЖОУИ: You knew about that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do you mean, like, buy it together?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You think we're ready for something like that?
ДЖОУИ: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's a big-it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
ДЖОУИ: Why, are you moving out?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not moving out.
ДЖОУИ: You'd tell me if you were moving out right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip.
ДЖОУИ: Aw, I know all about Kip!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
ДЖОУИ: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aw, don't do that.
НЕДРУГ: We've got a couple change s in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
ФИБИ: Ok, thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum.
НЕДРУГ: Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
ФИБИ: Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
ФИБИ: Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off oh whoops! You're being naked!
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.
МОНИКА: And Monica knows.
РОСС: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
МОНИКА: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
ДЖОУИ: So what's it gonna be?
РОСС: Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
ДЖОУИ: Or an uncle.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoebe!
РОСС: Hi Pheebs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Fine!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, what's the matter?
ФИБИ: Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, right, that's me!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, what is it?
ФИБИ: All right, you know Paolo?
РОСС: I'm familiar with his work, yes.
ФИБИ: Well, he made a move on me.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: More coffee over here, please!
ФИБИ: He made a move on me.
НЕДРУГ: Oooohhh.
РОСС: My God!
МОНИКА: Are you sure?
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
МОНИКА: Was it?
ФИБИ: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
НЕДРУГ: Oooooo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooo, what?
ФИБИ: Uma Thurman.
МОНИКА: Oh!
РОСС: The actress!
РОСС: Thanks Rach.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what are you gonna do?
РОСС: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
ДЖОУИ: Feminist issue. That's where I went!
ФИБИ: She is gonna hate me.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well.
ДЖОУИ: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's patio furniture!
ДЖОУИ: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, Uh-oh, I'm outside again? Of course!
НЕДРУГ: What about the birds?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, birds just don't say, Hello, sit here, eat something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You pick one.
ДЖОУИ: All right, how about the ladybugs?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
ДЖОУИ: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Are you moving out?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
ФИБИ: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, sure just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
ФИБИ: Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs.
ФИБИ: Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God,
ФИБИ: I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why have I never tasted these before?
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
ФИБИ: Which proves that I never lie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I guess you don't.
ФИБИ: Paolo made a pass at me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you think?
РОСС: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know!
МОНИКА: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
ДЖОУИ: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
МОНИКА: Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
ФИБИ: Are you okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I need some milk.
ФИБИ: Ok, I've got milk Here you go. Oh! Better?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No oh!, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so. Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
ФИБИ: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
НЕДРУГ: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
ФИБИ: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know right, he's the pig!
ФИБИ: Such a pig!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God, he's such a pig,

РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's like a big disgusting.
ФИБИ: like a.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: pig pig man!
ФИБИ: Yes, good! Ok.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, but he was my pig man how did I not see this?
ФИБИ: Oh! I know! It's because, he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Ok, Pheebs.
ФИБИ: The end.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God.
ФИБИ: Should I not have told you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better.
ФИБИ: I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so we should get over there and see if she's okay.
НЕДРУГ: Just one second! Score! Game! Come on.
НЕДРУГ: Ah ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
ДЖОУИ: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
РОСС: Come on, two on one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
РОСС: What, now?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the antiPaolo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
НЕДРУГ: No, that's cold, that's cold, that's.
РОСС: How's it going?
МОНИКА: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, Ok, that is either how could you? or enormous breasts! Here he comes!
ФИБИ: Ooh!
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
ФИБИ: Oh, ok bye-bye.
МОНИКА: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
НЕДРУГ: Grazie.
РОСС: Paolo, II just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say.
ФИБИ: Oh, just look at her.
РОСС: Oh you guys, II really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed.
МОНИКА: Oh, you're right.
РОСС: and I really think it should be me.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
РОСС: You all right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I've been better.
РОСС: Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't' want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
РОСС: Huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, you're so great!
РОСС: Ohhhh.
МОНИКА: Ooh hey honey, are you all right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ФИБИ: You ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: medium hmm any cookies left?
ФИБИ: Yep!
РОСС: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want.
РОСС: Uh, no, no, see, because not not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: II'm, I'm having a boy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
РОСС: WhaI'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, you're having a boy!
РОСС: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wha.
ДЖОУИ: Wha.
НЕДРУГ: What is it?
РОСС: I'm having a boy! II'm having a boy!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: We already knew that!
РОСС: I'm having a son. Um.
МОНИКА: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
НЕДРУГ: Shut-out!
МОНИКА: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah-get out!
МОНИКА: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: One more game?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah!
