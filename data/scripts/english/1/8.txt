НЕДРУГ: Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights, does it get better than this?
НЕДРУГ: Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'.
НЕДРУГ: Do you want a date Saturday?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes please.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's a he?
НЕДРУГ: Well yeah! Oh God. I- just I thought Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now -okay, goodbye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You did?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
МОНИКА: I did.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I think so, yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Not me.
РОСС: No no, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
РОСС: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman, who also liked her, so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
ФИБИ: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: WHAT IS IT?!
МОНИКА: Okay, II d'know, you-you just you have a quality.
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
МОНИКА: Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
РОСС: So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
МОНИКА: Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
РОСС: So, uh, how's she doing?
НЕДРУГ: The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
МОНИКА: How-how are you, Mom?
НЕДРУГ: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. What's with your hair?
МОНИКА: What?
НЕДРУГ: What's different?
МОНИКА: Nothing.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, maybe that's it.
МОНИКА: She is unbelievable, our mother is.
РОСС: Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
МОНИКА: Oh God!
МОНИКА: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
РОСС: Oh! Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from from restaurants.
НЕДРУГ: Not just restaurants, from our house.
НЕДРУГ: Mrs. Geller?
РОСС: She looks so small.
МОНИКА: I know.
РОСС: Well, at least she's with PopPop and Aunt Phyllis now.
МОНИКА: G'bye, Nana.
РОСС: Bye, Nana.
МОНИКА: Ross!
НЕДРУГ: What is going on?!
РОСС: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: She's not past, she's present, she's back.
НЕДРУГ: What's going on?
НЕДРУГ: She may have died.
НЕДРУГ: She may have died?
НЕДРУГ: We're looking into it.
РОСС: I, uh, I'll go see.
НЕДРУГ: This almost never happens!
РОСС: Now she's passed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, um, did she.
РОСС: Twice.
ДЖОУИ: Twice?
ФИБИ: Oh, that sucks!
ДЖОУИ: You guys okay?
РОСС: I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh.
ФИБИ: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
РОСС: Nono, she's gone.
МОНИКА: We checked. A lot.
ФИБИ: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?. I miss her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
ФИБИ: Thanks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
ДЖОУИ: Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! So Chandler looks gay, huh?
ФИБИ: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
РОСС: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
НЕДРУГ: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
НЕДРУГ: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
РОСС: I don't see why not.
РОСС: Here's my retainer!
НЕДРУГ: I was just thinking. When my time comes.
МОНИКА: Dad!
НЕДРУГ: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
МОНИКА: You what?
НЕДРУГ: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
МОНИКА: Define fun.
НЕДРУГ: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch.
МОНИКА: And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
НЕДРУГ: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
МОНИКА: That's probably what they'll say.
НЕДРУГ: I'd like that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, gorgeous.
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, nono, don't don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Okay! Phew!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, uh, what do you think it is about me?
НЕДРУГ: I dunno, uh, you just have a-a.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Quality, right, great.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
НЕДРУГ: What? He's cute!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, yeah. 's'no Brian in Payroll.
НЕДРУГ: Is Brian?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. I'm really not.
РОСС: This one?
НЕДРУГ: No.
РОСС: I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
НЕДРУГ: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
НЕДРУГ: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
РОСС: Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
НЕДРУГ: Wait! We need shoes!
РОСС: Okay. Um, how about these?
НЕДРУГ: That's really a day shoe.
РОСС: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
НЕДРУГ: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
РОСС: Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
НЕДРУГ: No, it really should be burgundy.
НЕДРУГ: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
РОСС: No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
РОСС: Oh my God.
НЕДРУГ: Is everything all right, dear?
РОСС: Yeah, just, just Nana stuff.
РОСС: How we doing, you guys ready?
МОНИКА: Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
РОСС: Some days it's all I can think about.
ФИБИ: Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
ФИБИ: What'd I say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hm-m.
МОНИКА: Are these the shoes?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
РОСС: What, we-uh we don't have shoes here, or?
ДЖОУИ: Morning. We ready to go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?. It's stuff like that, isn't it?
МОНИКА: It was a really beautiful service.
НЕДРУГ: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
ДЖОУИ: Check it out, GiantsCowboys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're watching a football game at a funeral?
ДЖОУИ: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are a frightening, frightening man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
РОСС: Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
ФИБИ: God, what a great day. What? Weather-wise!
РОСС: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees, even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh I dunno, almost life-aff.
НЕДРУГ: God! Ross!
РОСС: I'm fine. Just-just, having my worst fear realised.
ФИБИ: Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm huh.
РОСС: What, what is it?
ФИБИ: You missed a belt loop.
РОСС: Oh! No-n.
ФИБИ: Okay, it's in spasm.
НЕДРУГ: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
ФИБИ: Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
РОСС: I feel great. I feel great, I fleel great.
МОНИКА: Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
РОСС: Not the first two, but the second two woooo! I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister, I love Pheebs.
ФИБИ: Ooh! That's so nice.
РОСС: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РОСС: And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
НЕДРУГ: You were right.
РОСС: Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well you know who I love the most?
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You!
РОСС: Oh, you don't get it!
НЕДРУГ: Whaddya got there?
ДЖОУИ: Just a, uh, hearing disability.
НЕДРУГ: What's the score?
ДЖОУИ: Seventeen-fourteen Giants, three minutes to go in the third.
НЕДРУГ: Beautiful!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
НЕДРУГ: Your grandmother would have hated this.
МОНИКА: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
НЕДРУГ: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
МОНИКА: That sounds like Nana.
НЕДРУГ: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
МОНИКА: I can imagine.
НЕДРУГ: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
МОНИКА: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
НЕДРУГ: Tell her what?
МОНИКА: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair, for example.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
МОНИКА: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
НЕДРУГ: No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
МОНИКА: Huh.
НЕДРУГ: More wine, dear?
МОНИКА: Oh, I think so.
НЕДРУГ: Those earrings look really lovely on you.
МОНИКА: Thank you. They're yours.
НЕДРУГ: Actually they were Nana's.
НЕДРУГ: Now I'm depressed! Even more than I was.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
РОСС: That little naked guy would be me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aww, look at the little thing.
РОСС: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who are those people?
РОСС: Got me.
МОНИКА: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
МОНИКА: Let's see, 1939, yeah, 24, 25?
РОСС: Looks like a fun gang.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, look look look look look! I got Monica naked!
РОСС: Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Lowell.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So how's it going there in Financial Services?
НЕДРУГ: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh. I'm not.
НЕДРУГ: I know. That's what I told her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you can tell?
НЕДРУГ: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of, radar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
НЕДРУГ: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He is?
НЕДРУГ: Yup, and waaay out of your league.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
