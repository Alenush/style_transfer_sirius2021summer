РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. 
МОНИКА: Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something. 
НЕДРУГ: My god. You still have your Christmas lights up? Fill this out and bring it back to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. 
МОНИКА: All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, how much is this gonna cost? 
МОНИКА: I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well what are we gonna do? 
МОНИКА: There's not much we can do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, unless, unless I use yours. 
МОНИКА: No no no no no no no no no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" call person? 
МОНИКА: That's insurance fraud. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, all right, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow! 
МОНИКА: Ok. Ok. I hate this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Thank you. I love you. 
МОНИКА: Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
МОНИКА: I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine. 
НЕДРУГ: You are an idiot. 
МОНИКА: Yep, that's me. I am that stupid. 
РОСС: I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. 
НЕДРУГ: That's nice. 
РОСС: No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me. 
ДЖОУИ: Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. 
РОСС: Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you crazy? That's a baby! 
ДЖОУИ: He should take the sack? 
РОСС: Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, only if you order stuff. 
ДЖОУИ: I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. 
РОСС: Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday? 
ДЖОУИ: When's that? 
РОСС: Tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? 
РОСС: You take your time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There it is! So what're you gonna do? 
ДЖОУИ: What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And your friend Phoebe? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, uh, Monica? 
МОНИКА: Yes, yes she is. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, this is my friend Rachel. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Rachel. I'm Dr. Mitchell. 
НЕДРУГ: And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosin. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor? 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I meant young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh, Good Rach. 
МОНИКА: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it. 
МОНИКА: Uh, you left out the stupid part. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes. 
МОНИКА: I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, what have we learned so far? 
НЕДРУГ: Surprise! 
РОСС: What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Was that the cake? 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush. 
МОНИКА: Come on, she'll be here any minute. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I hope it's ok. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy birthday Peehee. 
МОНИКА: Well maybe we can make a "b" out of one of those roses. 
РОСС: Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools. 
ФИБИ: Hey, what's going on? 
НЕДРУГ: Surprise! 
ФИБИ: Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you see Betty? 
НЕДРУГ: I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd 'a' said "get out of my office!" 
РОСС: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea-- 
РОСС: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing? 
НЕДРУГ: No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about? 
РОСС: No, no, Dad, I was just wondering. 
НЕДРУГ: 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can still do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that? 
РОСС: Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg? 
РОСС: No, we can go to Williamsburg. 
НЕДРУГ: Eat your fish. 
МОНИКА: Rachel, the cute doctors are here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, coming! 
МОНИКА: Hi, come on in. 
НЕДРУГ: Here, we brought wine. 
НЕДРУГ: And this is from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's great. Look at that. 
НЕДРУГ: Monica, how's the ankle? 
МОНИКА: It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you. Well, listen, why don't you two sit down, and we'll get you some glasses....STAT. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are. I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine, I really do. 
МОНИКА: It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would you stop being such a wuss? 
МОНИКА: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok? 
НЕДРУГ: So? 
НЕДРУГ: So, they still seem normal. 
НЕДРУГ: That's because they are normal. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, but you have to admit that every time we go out with women we meet at the hospital, it turns into-- 
НЕДРУГ: Would you relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this. 
МОНИКА: I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am not a baby. You know what? 
МОНИКА: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what? 
МОНИКА: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. 
НЕДРУГ: This is a great place. How long have you lived here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus? 
НЕДРУГ: So, Monica, what do you do? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I'm a uh, chef at a restaurant uptown. 
НЕДРУГ: Good for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do. 
НЕДРУГ: This hummus is great. 
НЕДРУГ: God bless the chickpea. 
МОНИКА: Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow. 
МОНИКА: I used to wet my bed. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I use my breasts to get other people's attention. 
МОНИКА: We both do that. 
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Just a minute. Rachel, it's your dad. 
МОНИКА: Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had sex on your bed. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Daddy, daddy, why? Why would I sleep with Billy Drestin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead! 
МОНИКА: Ross, he's got the remote again. 
РОСС: Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, hold on a second. Let me see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Oh, god, what do we do, what do we do? 
МОНИКА: Find out what they want. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you do it. 
МОНИКА: Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were right, this was just not worth it. 
МОНИКА: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, let me just change. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hi. Trouble? 
ДЖОУИ: Your sister stood me up the other night. 
ФИБИ: Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you? 
РОСС: Well did you try calling her? 
ДЖОУИ: I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
ФИБИ: Um, you, got a minute? 
НЕДРУГ: Um, yeah, I'm just working. 
ФИБИ: So. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. 
ФИБИ: Um, oh, I got you a birthday present. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh, it's a Judy Jetson thermos. 
ФИБИ: Right, like the kind you-- 
НЕДРУГ: Right. Oh, I got something for you too. 
ФИБИ: How'd you know I was coming? 
НЕДРУГ: Um, yeah, um, twin thing. 
ФИБИ: I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over. 
ФИБИ: Does he know? 
НЕДРУГ: Who? 
ФИБИ: Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you. 
НЕДРУГ: He is? Why? 
ФИБИ: You got me. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad? 
ФИБИ: So, um, are you gonna call him? 
НЕДРУГ: Why, do you think he likes me? 
ФИБИ: No. Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken? 
ФИБИ: No. No food with a face. 
НЕДРУГ: You have not changed. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, you too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, remember us? 
НЕДРУГ: Mmm hmmm. 
МОНИКА: You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um... 
НЕДРУГ: You're that stupid. 
МОНИКА: I am. I'm that stupid. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check. 
НЕДРУГ: You know your insurance will cover that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I'm just not that bright either. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. 
РОСС: Do you have a point? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, you'd think I would. What's up with the simian? 
РОСС: It's just a furball. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, who's turn is it? 
РОСС: Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney". 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, you got zero points for "idney". 
РОСС: I had a "k". Where's my "k"? 
РОСС: You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a "k"! 
НЕДРУГ: You get that animal out of here. 
РОСС: No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do. 
МОНИКА: What's goin' on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me. This hospital is for people. 
РОСС: Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart! 
НЕДРУГ: I'll take a look at him. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you. 
МОНИКА: Michael. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: Monica. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you. 
ФИБИ: Listen, um. 
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, don't say "listen". I know that "listen". I've said that "listen". 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk. 
ДЖОУИ: You don't drink 
ДЖОУИ: Urs-- 
ФИБИ: Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work. 
ДЖОУИ: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: If it was, would you stop hanging out with her? 
ДЖОУИ: No. No, I, I couldn't do that. 
ФИБИ: Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me. 
ДЖОУИ: Then, uh, then I'm sorry. 
ФИБИ: You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over. 
ДЖОУИ: I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful. 
ФИБИ: Really? 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: He looks so tiny. 
ДЖОУИ: We just got the message. 
ФИБИ: Is he all right? 
РОСС: Yeah. The doctor got the "k" out. He also found an "m" and an "o". 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We think he was trying to spell out "monkey". 
РОСС: Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you feel like a dad yet? 
РОСС: No, why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad. 
РОСС: Aqui esta 
МОНИКА: Para mi 
ФИБИ: Y quien pidio el pollo General Tso? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pudo haber sido el General Tso 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Miren! El viejo desnudo est haciendo el hula hoop! (Look! The naked old man is hula hooping! 
НЕДРУГ: Hola, Joey 
ДЖОУИ: Hola, amigos 
МОНИКА: Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el contro remoto 
РОСС: Y el caso es que no le gusta la tele
