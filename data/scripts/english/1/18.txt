РОСС: Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...' 
РОСС: Rach, did you proofread these? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh... yeah, why? 
РОСС: Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail? 
НЕДРУГ: Lots of responses. 
НЕДРУГ: : Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me. 
НЕДРУГ: : Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... 
НЕДРУГ: : We have apple cinnamon... 
НЕДРУГ: : OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: : Your Visa bill is huge! 
НЕДРУГ: Give me that! 
НЕДРУГ: You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again? 
РОСС: I don't know. 
НЕДРУГ: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing? 
РОСС: No, it's not just that. It's just--I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... 
НЕДРУГ: ...little playthings with yarn? 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Could you want her more? 
РОСС: Who? 
НЕДРУГ: Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening. 
РОСС: Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! How are you? 
РОСС: We're fine, we're fine. 
НЕДРУГ: OK. 
ДЖОУИ: Shut up! 
НЕДРУГ: We're not--we're not saying anything. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РОСС: Uhhhh... Joey cried last night. 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: We were playing poker, alright... 
ДЖОУИ: There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? 
РОСС: Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.' 
НЕДРУГ: And then he did. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play? 
РОСС: No, women are welcome to play. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it? 
НЕДРУГ: There just don't happen to be any women in our games. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, right. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse! 
НЕДРУГ: Really. 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, that's a typical guy response. 
РОСС: Excuse me, do any of you know how to play? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: But you could teach us. 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, so now we draw cards. 
НЕДРУГ: So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, good for you! 
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations! 
НЕДРУГ: OK Phoebs, how many do you want? 
НЕДРУГ: OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs. 
РОСС: No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't--you can't do-- 
НЕДРУГ: Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! ROSS: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no no no no no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours. 
РОСС: Oh, you're... 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites. 
НЕДРУГ: OOooooo! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz-- 
НЕДРУГ: OK, so at this point, the dealer-- 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks... 
РОСС: Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy... 
НЕДРУГ: But... I'm ready, so, just deal. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards. 
НЕДРУГ: Dammit, dammit, dammit! 
НЕДРУГ: : Oh I see, so then, you were lying. 
ДЖОУИ: About what? 
НЕДРУГ: About how good your cards were. 
ДЖОУИ: Heh... I was bluffing. 
НЕДРУГ: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying? 
НЕДРУГ: OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
НЕДРУГ: Rach, Rach, we gotta settle. 
НЕДРУГ: Settle what? 
НЕДРУГ: The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... 
РОСС: The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Right. 
ДЖОУИ: You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright? 
НЕДРУГ: Hell no, we'll pay! 
НЕДРУГ: OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready. 
НЕДРУГ: And you know what? We want a rematch. 
РОСС: Well that's fine with me. Could use the money. 
НЕДРУГ: : So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends. 
РОСС: ...Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. 
РОСС: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... 
ДЖОУИ: ...Yeah? 
РОСС: I'm not a nice guy. 
РОСС: Alright boys, let's eat. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria? 
РОСС: You still on that? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy! 
РОСС: You are way off, pal. 
ДЖОУИ: No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her. 
РОСС: Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time--not any more. I just--I-- 
РОСС: Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? 
РОСС: You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK--if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. 
НЕДРУГ: Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. 
НЕДРУГ: Ha. Ha, ha. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. 
НЕДРУГ: Please! I am not as bad as Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident? 
НЕДРУГ: That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand. 
НЕДРУГ: Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! 
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding! Where? Where? 
НЕДРУГ: : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Rachel! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, what's the job? 
НЕДРУГ: Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living! 
НЕДРУГ: OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Is Tony Randall dead? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: I don't think so. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank y-- 
НЕДРУГ: Girls, sit down. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? 
РОСС: Alright. 
РОСС: I'm gonna pay for that tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РОСС: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! 
НЕДРУГ: Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? 
НЕДРУГ: Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and--oh, I went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! 
НЕДРУГ: That's great! That's wonderful! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story-- 
НЕДРУГ: OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary? 
НЕДРУГ: Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, we should. I think we should. 
РОСС: Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those? 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go. 
РОСС: Alright. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright... 
РОСС: So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. 
ДЖОУИ: But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed. 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. 
НЕДРУГ: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie. 
РОСС: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... 
НЕДРУГ: Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. 
НЕДРУГ: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever. 
НЕДРУГ: Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon. 
РОСС: So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing. 
НЕДРУГ: Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, where are you going? 
РОСС: Uh... to the bathroom. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker? 
РОСС: I want to go to the bathroom. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no no no no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then. 
ДЖОУИ: That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, Cincinatti, no blinds, everybody ante. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! .... or no. 
РОСС: Alright. : Your money's mine, Green. 
НЕДРУГ: Your fly is open, Geller. 
НЕДРУГ: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Um... I'm out. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm in. 
НЕДРУГ: Me too. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too. Alright, whattaya got. 
РОСС: Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I think--oh--that one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it... 
НЕДРУГ: And your fly's still open... 
НЕДРУГ: Ha, I made you look.... 
НЕДРУГ: I couldn't be inner. Monica? 
НЕДРУГ: Monica, in or out? 
НЕДРУГ: I hate this game! 
НЕДРУГ: OK Joey, your bet. 
ДЖОУИ: Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross? 
РОСС: Oh, I am very in. 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler? 
НЕДРУГ: Couldn't be more out. 
НЕДРУГ: Me too. Rachel. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck? 
РОСС: No, not this time. So... what'd you have? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not telling. 
РОСС: Come on, show them to me. 
НЕДРУГ: No..! 
РОСС: Show them to me! 
НЕДРУГ: Get your hands out of there! No! 
РОСС: Let me see! Show them! 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, I've had dates like this. 
НЕДРУГ: Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple... 
НЕДРУГ: Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants. 
РОСС: First of all, I'm not losing... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. 
РОСС: Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the-- 
НЕДРУГ: Hel-lo, Rachel Green. 
РОСС: Mee mee, mee-mee mee. 
НЕДРУГ: : Excuse me. : It's about the job. 
НЕДРУГ: Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea--Hello? Hello? 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, Rach. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.......OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, we do. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, check. 
ДЖОУИ: Check. 
РОСС: I'm in for fifty cents. 
НЕДРУГ: Call. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm in. 
НЕДРУГ: I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. 
РОСС: I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that? 
НЕДРУГ: : Loser? 
РОСС: No, I fold. 
НЕДРУГ: What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it? 
РОСС: I'm in. 
НЕДРУГ: How many you want? 
РОСС: One. 
НЕДРУГ: Dealer takes two. What do you bet? 
РОСС: I bet two dollars. 
НЕДРУГ: OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. 
РОСС: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. 
НЕДРУГ: See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, there's nothing in it. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, then get me your purse. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, here you go. Good luck. 
НЕДРУГ: : Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven. 
НЕДРУГ: ...teen! 
РОСС: : Joey, I'm a little shy. 
ДЖОУИ: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What? 
НЕДРУГ: : What do you need, what do you need? 
РОСС: Fifteen. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, here's ten. 
ДЖОУИ: Here, I got five, I got five. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Good luck. 
РОСС: : OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got? 
НЕДРУГ: Full house. 
РОСС: You got me. 
ДЖОУИ: : Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat. 
НЕДРУГ: : I thought we had them! 
РОСС: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is. 
НЕДРУГ: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, time's up. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye... bye... BIRDIE. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! 
НЕДРУГ: That's a bird? 
НЕДРУГ: That's a bird! 
НЕДРУГ: OK, OK, it's my turn. 
НЕДРУГ: Go. 
РОСС: Uh.... bean! Bean! 
ДЖОУИ: The Unbearable Likeness of Being! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! 
НЕДРУГ: That, you get? That, you get?
