ФИБИ: Hi guys!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
РОСС: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
ФИБИ: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
НЕДРУГ: Ohh. Ouch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
МОНИКА: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Since when?
ДЖОУИ: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
ФИБИ: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And everybody knows this?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Cushions the blow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
РОСС: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
МОНИКА: Uh, Ross.
РОСС: What? Wh hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was it w-. Oh my God, Chi Chi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?
ДЖОУИ: Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, that was really good!
ДЖОУИ: Thanks! Let's keep going.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?
ДЖОУИ: I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Smoke away.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Relax your hand!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not so much!
ДЖОУИ: Whoah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, now try taking a puff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, okay. No. Give it to me.
ДЖОУИ: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
ДЖОУИ: Y'miss it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh, my. God.
МОНИКА: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
ДЖОУИ: That's ridiculous!
РОСС: Can I use, either thumb?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey. Coffee black. Late. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good for me!
ДЖОУИ: Y'okay, Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Yeah no I'm just it's, I haven't worked It's my bank.
МОНИКА: What did they do to you?
ФИБИ: It's nothing, it's just Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT.
РОСС: Easy.
ФИБИ: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, Satan's minions at work again.
ФИБИ: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about? Keep it!
ФИБИ: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not mine'.
МОНИКА: We're with you. We got it.
ФИБИ: Okay. I'd just I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, what are you doing?
МОНИКА: Hey. Whaddya doing?
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Oh, God!
РОСС: What is this?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
ФИБИ: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this is my reward!
РОСС: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so this time I won't quit!
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh! Put it out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
ФИБИ: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
МОНИКА: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This Alan again? How's it goin'?
МОНИКА: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
ДЖОУИ: So when do we get to meet the guy?
МОНИКА: Let's see, today's Monday. Never.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, come on! Come on!
МОНИКА: No. Not after what happened with Steve.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy! Sorry.
МОНИКА: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then can we meet him?
МОНИКА: Nope. Schhorry.
МОНИКА: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
НЕДРУГ: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
МОНИКА: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.
ДЖОУИ: Let it go, Ross.
РОСС: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
МОНИКА: Do you all promise?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
МОНИКА: Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
ДЖОУИ: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
РОСС: Hey, Pheebs.
ФИБИ: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What bank is this?
МОНИКА: Hey. It's him. Who is it?
НЕДРУГ: It's Alan.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler! He's here!
МОНИКА: Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
МОНИКА: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Alan.
НЕДРУГ: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
МОНИКА: Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
МОНИКА: C'mon!
РОСС: I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
НЕДРУГ: Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
МОНИКА: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And did you notice?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
ФИБИ: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
РОСС: What shoe?
ФИБИ: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a, while.'
РОСС: So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th I think this could be, y'know, it.
МОНИКА: Really!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
РОСС: You know what I like most about him, though?
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: The way he makes me feel about myself.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Hi, how was the game?
РОСС: Well.
НЕДРУГ: WE WON! Thank you! Yes!
МОНИКА: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
ДЖОУИ: Alan.
РОСС: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first baseAlan, second baseAlan, third base-.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.
МОНИКА: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe, sometimes.
РОСС: What?
МОНИКА: I dunno, a little too Alan?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
РОСС: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
ФИБИ: Hey, Lizzie.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Weird Girl.
ФИБИ: I brought you alphabet soup.
НЕДРУГ: Did you pick out the vowels?
ФИБИ: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, sometimes y. Uh, I also have something else for you.
НЕДРУГ: Saltines?
ФИБИ: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
НЕДРУГ: What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.
ФИБИ: I know.
НЕДРУГ: Weird Girl, what are you doing?
ФИБИ: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, I haI have to give you something.
ФИБИ: Oh, that's fine, no.
НЕДРУГ: Would you like my tin-foil hat?
ФИБИ: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Please, let me do something.
ФИБИ: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Keep the change. Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
ФИБИ: No, I'm fine.
НЕДРУГ: See ya.
ФИБИ: Huh!
РОСС: A thumb?!
НЕДРУГ: Eww!
ФИБИ: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
ФИБИ: Does, um, anyone wanna see?
НЕДРУГ: Nooo!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's worse than the thumb!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, this is so unfair!
МОНИКА: Oh, why is it unfair?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing?. I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
ДЖОУИ: Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, II could live without it.
ДЖОУИ: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
РОСС: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you do, do you?
РОСС: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Indeed there isn't. I should really get back to work.
ФИБИ: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
МОНИКА: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
НЕДРУГ: No.
МОНИКА: Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
НЕДРУГ: Wait wait, we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
МОНИКА: Can you believe it?. Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
НЕДРУГ: Honey, you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
МОНИКА: I know, it's gonna be really hard.
НЕДРУГ: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
МОНИКА: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
ДЖОУИ: Do you have any respect for your body?
РОСС: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big-.well, that's true, Gee, y'know, no-one no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, he's good.
РОСС: If only he were a woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
РОСС: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
МОНИКА: Hey. Where's Joey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think he's across the hall.
МОНИКА: Thanks.
РОСС: There y'go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that PopTart?. Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Does anyone want the rest of this PopTart?
РОСС: Hey, I might!
ФИБИ: Sorry. Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding. Oh my God.
ФИБИ: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. What is up with the universe?!
ДЖОУИ: What's going on?
МОНИКА: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
ДЖОУИ: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, God!
МОНИКА: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! That was Lambchop!
МОНИКА: Please, guys, we have to talk.
ФИБИ: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu no, I'm not.
МОНИКА: Alright, we have to talk.
ФИБИ: There it is!
МОНИКА: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this, uh. I've decided to break up with Alan.
РОСС: Is there somebody else?
МОНИКА: No, nononono, it's just, things change. People change.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We didn't change.
ДЖОУИ: So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
ФИБИ: You know, you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just I.
МОНИКА: Look, I- I could go on pretending.
ДЖОУИ: Okay!
МОНИКА: but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan It wouldn't be fair to you!
РОСС: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
МОНИКА: I'm sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up I wanted him to meet my family.
МОНИКА: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah! Right!
МОНИКА: Are you guys gonna be okay?
РОСС: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
МОНИКА: I understand.
НЕДРУГ: Wow.
МОНИКА: I'm, I'm really sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
МОНИКА: Relieved?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you. I just can't stand your friends.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?. That was fun.
РОСС: Yeah. He could row like a viking.
МОНИКА: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Mmm.
РОСС: So how'd it go?
МОНИКА: Oh, y'know.
ФИБИ: Did he mention us?
МОНИКА: He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
РОСС: You had a rough day, huh, c'mere.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
НЕДРУГ: No no no!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
ФИБИ: If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, alright.
