МОНИКА: Tell him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
ФИБИ: Tell him, tell him. 
МОНИКА: Just...please tell him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shut up! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell me what? 
МОНИКА: Look at you, you won't even look at him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were... 
ФИБИ: Doing it on this table. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Exellent dream score. 
РОСС: Why, why, why would you dream that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: More importantly, was I any good? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you were pretty damnedy good. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. 
РОСС: I love it, when we share. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're okay there? 
РОСС: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and I was somebody else's subconscious. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Get off. 
ФИБИ: Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. What are you wearing? 
РОСС: Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press? 
ФИБИ: Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pirates again? 
ФИБИ: No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop". And they are. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks Joey, that's a good idea. 
ФИБИ: What... I could, I could do it. What is it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs reduced. It's a whole big boob story. 
ФИБИ: I could be a secretary. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day. 
ФИБИ: I could do that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you playing with? 
РОСС: Oh, it's my new beeper. 
ДЖОУИ: What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? 
МОНИКА: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' 
РОСС: No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid. 
МОНИКА: All right, I'll see you guys later. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Off to see young Ethan? 
МОНИКА: Thank you. 
ДЖОУИ: How young is young Ethan? Young? 
МОНИКА: He's... our age. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When we were? 
МОНИКА: Okay, he's a senior in college. 
РОСС: College? 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this manchild has no problem with how old you are? 
МОНИКА: No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
МОНИКА: Oh, I can't pass for 22? 
ФИБИ: Well, maybe 25-26. 
МОНИКА: I am 26. 
ФИБИ: There you go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you hear that? 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See That'll stop when you pick up the phone. 
ФИБИ: Oh. Uh, I'm on. 
ФИБИ: Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops. 
ФИБИ: Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: Ross says hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah! 
ФИБИ: This is so fun. All right, what do we do now? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, now, I actually have to get to work. 
ФИБИ: Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ФИБИ: All right. Bye bye. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye bye. 
ФИБИ: Whatcha doin'? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh. 
МОНИКА: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh. 
МОНИКА: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Could tonight be the Night? 
МОНИКА: I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, did you shave your legs? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aha! 
ДЖОУИ: Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean... 
РОСС: Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. 
РОСС: Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr' is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services. 
ДЖОУИ: Services? Oh, services. 
РОСС: Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey. How was the first day? 
ФИБИ: Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me. 
ФИБИ: No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not? 
ФИБИ: Oh, because, you know... they don't like you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: I thought you knew that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Noho. Why doesn't they like me? 
ФИБИ: Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking about? 
ФИБИ: Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing". 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't belive it. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah. They even do you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They do me? 
ФИБИ: You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?' 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't sound like that. 
РОСС: Oh, oh Chandler... 
ДЖОУИ: Oh... Yeah, you do. 
РОСС: 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.' 
ДЖОУИ: My scones. 
НЕДРУГ: 'My scones.' 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up! 
МОНИКА: Did not. 
НЕДРУГ: I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place wher crimes happen. 
МОНИКА: How was that possible? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' You know, I just kept thinking: why do people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Unless-- 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
МОНИКА: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'd really like that. 
НЕДРУГ: Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know. 
МОНИКА: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat'? 
НЕДРУГ: Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh... 
МОНИКА: Ethan-- 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Are you a virgin? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right? 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
МОНИКА: You keep saying that. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practise it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. 
МОНИКА: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong. 
МОНИКА: No no. Nothing wrong about that. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. 
НЕДРУГ: Huh! 
МОНИКА: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said. 
МОНИКА: You're not a senior? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm a senior... in High School. 
МОНИКА: Ok...ay. 
МОНИКА: What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial. 
НЕДРУГ: I just had sex. 
МОНИКА: Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you never told me how old you were. 
МОНИКА: Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? 
НЕДРУГ: I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'-- 
МОНИКА: Don't say it. 
НЕДРУГ: --in love with you. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. 
МОНИКА: Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. I'm Joan Collins. 
НЕДРУГ: Who? 
РОСС: Okay, Andr' should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, forget it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. 
РОСС: Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
РОСС: You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it was just the three of us. 
РОСС: Huh! 
ДЖОУИ: So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He, he, he. You know what? 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There were times when it wasn't even me. 
ФИБИ: That is so sweet, you guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Mon. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? 
НЕДРУГ: Mon! 
МОНИКА: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ethan called again. 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
РОСС: Are you not seeing him anymore? 
МОНИКА: No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest "Power Ranger" is? 
РОСС: Oh, yeah. 
МОНИКА: Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. 
РОСС: It's morphin time! 
ДЖОУИ: Stegosaurus! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tyrannosaurus! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where are you going? 
ФИБИ: Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Work people? Nobody told me. 
ФИБИ: No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I don't get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person. 
ФИБИ: Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You think I should? 
ФИБИ: I really do, yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory". 
ФИБИ: You were great. But they still made fun of you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss", "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss", "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing" 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then, I don't get it. 
ФИБИ: Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They do? 
ФИБИ: Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just wan't to-- 
ФИБИ: No, but you can't. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I just wa-- 
ФИБИ: Uh uh. 
МОНИКА: Aren't you gonna-- 
РОСС: Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it. 
ДЖОУИ: What about Andr'? 
РОСС: Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: That was gonna be my opener. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom? 
РОСС: I thought that was just a rumour. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: True story. 
ДЖОУИ: They're here allready? 
НЕДРУГ: All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk , we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay I have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great. 
МОНИКА: It was. 
НЕДРУГ: Then, what's the problem? 
МОНИКА: Ethan, it's um... it's icky. 
НЕДРУГ: Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky? 
МОНИКА: This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really-- 
НЕДРУГ: No, don't say it. 
МОНИКА: --love you. 
РОСС: Are you're hands still wet? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, moist, yeah.
