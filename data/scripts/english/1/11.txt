НЕДРУГ: Monica and Phoebe are walking to a newsstand.
ФИБИ: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
МОНИКА: Why?
ФИБИ: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
МОНИКА: Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
ФИБИ: Where? Ooh, come to Momma.
МОНИКА: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
НЕДРУГ: Nice hat.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
ФИБИ: We should do something. Whistle.
МОНИКА: We are not going to whistle.
ФИБИ: Come on, do it.
МОНИКА: No!
ФИБИ: Do it!
МОНИКА: No!
ФИБИ: Do it do it do it!
МОНИКА: Woo-woo!
ФИБИ: I can't believe you did that!
МОНИКА: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
ФИБИ: I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, what are you doing?
ФИБИ: Maybe nobody's tried this.
МОНИКА: I wish we at least knew his name. Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
МОНИКА: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And he can dance!
ФИБИ: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
МОНИКА: I wish all guys could be like him.
ФИБИ: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
МОНИКА: He doesn't have anyone.
ФИБИ: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
НЕДРУГ: Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime, HBL and Cinemax.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No way, forget it.
ДЖОУИ: C'mon, she's your mom!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch'.
РОСС: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can say that because she's not your mom.
РОСС: Oh, please.
НЕДРУГ: Bona sera.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi sweetie.
РОСС: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
МОНИКА: Last night.
РОСС: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?. Just a dream I had but, phew.
ФИБИ: Hey hey hey! She's on!
НЕДРУГ: Ah! Nora Bing!
НЕДРУГ: Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
ФИБИ: Your mom was arrested?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
НЕДРУГ: This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
НЕДРУГ: Shhh.
НЕДРУГ: I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!
НЕДРУГ: Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate but I get to see my son, who I love.
НЕДРУГ: Awww!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, don't take this wrong, II just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then he burst into flames.
МОНИКА: Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill, the mayor wants to raise subway fares again, the high today was forty-five, and oh, teams played sports.
ФИБИ: What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
МОНИКА: Nah, not-not special enough.
ФИБИ: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
МОНИКА: Waaay too special.
НЕДРУГ: I am famished. What do I want.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
РОСС: What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
НЕДРУГ: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know I am.
НЕДРУГ: Who's doing shots?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ФИБИ: I'm in.
НЕДРУГ: There y'go. Ross?
РОСС: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Sorry sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
РОСС: But a man can change.
РОСС: Anyone want me to appraise anything?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, any messages for room 226?
НЕДРУГ: You okay there, slugger?
РОСС: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
НЕДРУГ: What is with you tonight?
РОСС: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, thank you. It's the Italian HandLicker, isn't it.
РОСС: No. It's the one he's licking.
НЕДРУГ: She's supposed to be with you.
РОСС: You're good.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
РОСС: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
НЕДРУГ: No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
РОСС: When?
НЕДРУГ: He's not a hero. You know who our hero is.
РОСС: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
НЕДРУГ: No, it's you!
РОСС: Please.
НЕДРУГ: No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy.
РОСС: Right.
НЕДРУГ: You are gonna be fine, believe me.
РОСС: Uh-oh.
ДЖОУИ: Uhhhh. I'll just pee in the street.
РОСС: Hey, is Chandler here?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РОСС: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler, you didn't tell. Okay, 'cause I'm thinking we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
ДЖОУИ: Right. No big deal.
РОСС: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: In Bizarro World! You broke the code!
РОСС: What code?
ДЖОУИ: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt, but not a mom, never a mom!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you guys doing out here?
РОСС: Uh, uh. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
РОСС: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
РОСС: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, how could you let this happen?
РОСС: I don't know, God, I- well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's.
ДЖОУИ: You don't think my mom's sexy?
РОСС: Well not in the same way.
ДЖОУИ: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
РОСС: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What're you guys doing out here?
РОСС: Well, not playing raquetball!
ДЖОУИ: He forgot to leave his grip size!
РОСС: He didn't get the goggles!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well,sounds like you two have issues.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Goodbye, baby.
НЕДРУГ: Ciao, bela.
РОСС: Do they wait for me to do this?
ДЖОУИ: So are you gonna tell him?
РОСС: Why would I tell him?
ДЖОУИ: How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
РОСС: Oh.
МОНИКА: What are you guys doing here?
ДЖОУИ: Uhhhh, he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
МОНИКА: What did I ask?
МОНИКА: Hi.
ФИБИ: Hi.
МОНИКА: What are you doing here?
ФИБИ: Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by, y'know, after the uh, that I, y'know, so what are you doing here?
МОНИКА: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off on the way, my way. Do you come here a lot? Without me?
ФИБИ: No. No! No! So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
МОНИКА: How would I know? II wasn't here.
ФИБИ: Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God.
РОСС: You're my friend. II had to tell you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
РОСС: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun.uh. I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РОСС: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora um, Mrs. Mom your Bing was just being nice, y'know, and But nothing happened, nothing Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You knew about this?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
РОСС: Thanks, man, big help.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
РОСС: I wasn't I mean, I.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
РОСС: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe you did this.
РОСС: Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: Me neither, y'know what.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
ДЖОУИ: What are you mad at me for?!
РОСС: Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You gotta let me slam the door!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?
РОСС: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Ah! Huh?
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
МОНИКА: 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
ФИБИ: Hey Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hello.
МОНИКА: Hello.
ФИБИ: Going to the hospital tonight?
МОНИКА: No, you?
ФИБИ: No, you?
МОНИКА: You just asked me.
ФИБИ: Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. I am so hot!
ДЖОУИ: Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
РОСС: I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
ДЖОУИ: C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
ФИБИ: Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: What was that?
РОСС: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, MotherKisser?
ДЖОУИ: MotherKisser. I'll shut up.
РОСС: Chandler, can I just say something? II know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
РОСС: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it's complicated, it's complex Hey, you kissed my mom!
РОСС: We're rehearsing a Greek play.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's very funny. We done now?
РОСС: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
РОСС: Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!
ФИБИ: Alright, whadyou do with him?
МОНИКА: Oh! You're awake!
ФИБИ: Look at you! How, how do you feel?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
МОНИКА: You look good!
НЕДРУГ: I feel good! Who are you?
МОНИКА: Oh, sorry.
ФИБИ: I'm Phoebe Buffay.
МОНИКА: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
ФИБИ: Well, we both have.
НЕДРУГ: So, the Etch-aSketch is from you guys?
ФИБИ: Well, actually it's just from me.
МОНИКА: I got you the foot massager.
ФИБИ: You know who shaved you? That was me.
МОНИКА: I read to you.
ФИБИ: I sang. Hah!
НЕДРУГ: Well,, thanks.
МОНИКА: Oh, my pleasure.
ФИБИ: You're welcome.
НЕДРУГ: So. I guess I'll see you around.
ФИБИ: What, that's it?
МОНИКА: 'See you around'?
НЕДРУГ: Well, what do you want me to say?
МОНИКА: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, 'That was nice'? It meant something to me? 'I'll call you'?
НЕДРУГ: Alright, I'll call you.
ФИБИ: I don't think you mean that.
МОНИКА: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
НЕДРУГ: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, well, be good, I love you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You kissed my best Ross! Or something to that effect.
НЕДРУГ: O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really stupid.
НЕДРУГ: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. No. No.
РОСС: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
ДЖОУИ: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
РОСС: You're kidding.
ДЖОУИ: No, no. He said 'When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?'
РОСС: Wow!
ДЖОУИ: Then she came back with 'The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?'
РОСС: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say 'When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?'?
ДЖОУИ: That makes more sense.
РОСС: So, what's going on now?
ДЖОУИ: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
РОСС: Whaddya see?
ДЖОУИ: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away, they're walking away. No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
НЕДРУГ: You okay, kiddo?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, okay.
НЕДРУГ: Alright.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice save.

НЕДРУГ: Mr. Geller.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РОСС: You mean that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, why not. So I told her.
РОСС: Yeah? How'd it go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
РОСС: Well, howdya feel?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pretty good! I told her.
РОСС: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But, we don't have to go down that road.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
МОНИКА: What's a 'niffle'?
ДЖОУИ: You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist.
РОСС: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
НЕДРУГ: Nooo!
