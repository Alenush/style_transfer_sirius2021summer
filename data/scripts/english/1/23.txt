НЕДРУГ: She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
МОНИКА: I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
РОСС: I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucous plug.
ДЖОУИ: Do we have to know about that?
МОНИКА: Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
ДЖОУИ: I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
РОСС: God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction. What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have to pick your moments.
ФИБИ: Did I miss it, did I miss it?
РОСС: She's not even here yet.
МОНИКА: What's with the guitar?
ФИБИ: I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
РОСС: Where the hell have you been?
НЕДРУГ: We stopped at the gift shop.
НЕДРУГ: I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
РОСС: Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I used to have that bumper sticker. You see what I mean.
РОСС: Stopped for a chunky.
НЕДРУГ: Let it go, Ross.
НЕДРУГ: I got an extra one. You want this?
РОСС: No.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
РОСС: Dr. Franzblau, hi.
НЕДРУГ: So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
НЕДРУГ: They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
РОСС: 59 seconds. Quartz, ha.
НЕДРУГ: Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
НЕДРУГ: Am I allowed to drink anything.
НЕДРУГ: Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
РОСС: I'll get it.
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
РОСС: I got it-I'm getting it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And if you need anything else, I--do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm uh Rachel Green. I'm Carol's ex-husband's sister's roommate.
НЕДРУГ: It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's brother's ex-wife's obstetrician.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's funny!
МОНИКА: I want a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
МОНИКА: Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
ДЖОУИ: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
НЕДРУГ: Knick fan?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, boy, do they suck.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, listen, lady. whoa.
НЕДРУГ: Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah? And who do you like?
НЕДРУГ: The Celtics.
ДЖОУИ: The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if wait. They suck, all right?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You waah!
ДЖОУИ: Wha? Wha.aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
НЕДРУГ: There is no father.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm oh!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
НЕДРУГ: Ok.
ФИБИ: They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry. Thanks, Ross.
РОСС: Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
ФИБИ: Ok.
МОНИКА: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute. No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You'll get one.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah? When?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
МОНИКА: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
МОНИКА: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no.
МОНИКА: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, uh.
МОНИКА: Well?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dear god! This parachute is a knapsack!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
МОНИКА: Did you go home and change?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
МОНИКА: No, I haven't seen him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was like your father a doctor?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No reason.
НЕДРУГ: Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who? Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
ДЖОУИ: HI, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?
НЕДРУГ: She's not much of a phone person.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe you should.
ДЖОУИ: Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that is so not true.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it is.
НЕДРУГ: It isn't.
ДЖОУИ: It is.
НЕДРУГ: Isn't!
РОСС: Breathe.
НЕДРУГ: Breathe.
РОСС: Breathe.
НЕДРУГ: Breathe.
РОСС: Breathe.
НЕДРУГ: Breathe.
НЕДРУГ: You're gonna kill me!
РОСС: 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12.
НЕДРУГ: Count faster.
НЕДРУГ: It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
РОСС: Who the hell is Jordie?
НЕДРУГ: Your son.
РОСС: No no no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
НЕДРУГ: Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
РОСС: What? Whoa, whoa whoa, what do you mean back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie, we just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
НЕДРУГ: Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
РОСС: I got it.
НЕДРУГ: I got it.
РОСС: I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
НЕДРУГ: No, you don't.
НЕДРУГ: All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
РОСС: Why?
НЕДРУГ: He started it!
РОСС: No, you started it.
НЕДРУГ: You did!
НЕДРУГ: I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
РОСС: But.
НЕДРУГ: Now go!
РОСС: Thanks a lot.
НЕДРУГ: See what you did.
РОСС: Yeah, listen.
НЕДРУГ: OUT!
НЕДРУГ: Breathe, breathe, breathe.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no.
ДЖОУИ: Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
НЕДРУГ: It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
ДЖОУИ: Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
НЕДРУГ: Breathe, breathe, breathe.
РОСС: Please. This is so your fault.
НЕДРУГ: How, how is this my fault?
РОСС: Look, Carol never threw me out of her room before you came along.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
РОСС: You tryin' to be clever?
НЕДРУГ: You know what your problem is? You are so threatened by me.
РОСС: Oh, I'm threatened by you?
НЕДРУГ: Yes.
ФИБИ: Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
РОСС: Yeah, Susan.
ФИБИ: Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
НЕДРУГ: Help!
РОСС: I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow.
НЕДРУГ: Are they here yet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
НЕДРУГ: Ok.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok?
НЕДРУГ: Ok.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
НЕДРУГ: It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's- I was just-yeah, right. Push! Push!
НЕДРУГ: What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
РОСС: Help! Help!
ФИБИ: They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next la la.
НЕДРУГ: Help!
МОНИКА: Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where have you been?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, just had a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mazeltov!
НЕДРУГ: I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
НЕДРУГ: No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you do what I do. It's like uh. Well, for instance, what do you do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm a waitress.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, if I see one more cup of coffee.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, gotcha.
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. That's fine.
НЕДРУГ: So how did you know I was even here?
НЕДРУГ: Your mom called me. So is this her?
НЕДРУГ: No, this is a loaner.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
НЕДРУГ: I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. so, did you see who won the game?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they're not so bad.
РОСС: Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be like the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
НЕДРУГ: The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
РОСС: No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok, where does that leave me?
НЕДРУГ: You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no Lesbian Lover Day.
РОСС: Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
ФИБИ: This is so great.
РОСС: You wanna explain that?
ФИБИ: I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.
НЕДРУГ: Where are they?
МОНИКА: I'm sure they'll be here soon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
ДЖОУИ: Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are really frightening me. Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?
НЕДРУГ: All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
НЕДРУГ: All right, honey, time to start pushing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But they're not here yet!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, god.
РОСС: Ok, got the vent open.
ФИБИ: Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben to the rescue.
РОСС: Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
НЕДРУГ: What do you see?
ФИБИ: Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
РОСС: Pheebs, It's open! It's open!
НЕДРУГ: Wait! You forgot your legs!
НЕДРУГ: Push, push!
РОСС: We're here!
НЕДРУГ: Where have you been?
РОСС: Long story, honey.
НЕДРУГ: All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need-Excuse me, could I have this?
НЕДРУГ: All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
НЕДРУГ: Good luck!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
НЕДРУГ: Out!
НЕДРУГ: All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
РОСС: Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
НЕДРУГ: You're not helping!
НЕДРУГ: You're doing great, you're doing fine. Hello!
РОСС: Oh, sorry.
НЕДРУГ: What do you see? What do you see?
РОСС: We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, look at that.
НЕДРУГ: What does he look like?
РОСС: Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jello.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: You guys, he's beautiful!
РОСС: Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
НЕДРУГ: No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
РОСС: How 'bout Ben?
НЕДРУГ: I like Ben.
НЕДРУГ: Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
РОСС: We uh, we just cooked it up.
НЕДРУГ: That's what we were off doing.
МОНИКА: Hi.
РОСС: Hey.
МОНИКА: Can we come in?
РОСС: I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
ФИБИ: Susan, he looks just like you.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I still am one of these.
МОНИКА: Ross, can I?
РОСС: The head, the head. You gotta.
МОНИКА: Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I. I will always have gum.
РОСС: Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
МОНИКА: He is so amazing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know. Look at him.
ДЖОУИ: Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
ФИБИ: Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes.
ДЖОУИ: He doesn't do much, does he?
РОСС: No, this is pretty much it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys wanna get some coffee?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: All right, I'll see you guys later.
ФИБИ: Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
