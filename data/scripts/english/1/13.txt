РЕЙЧЕЛ: Daaargh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aaarrgh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's it! You just barge in here! You don't knock, you have no.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: respect for anybody's privacy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rachel. Wait, wait.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you wait. This is ridiculous.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I just say one thing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a relatively open weave, and I can still see, your nippular areas.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aaarrggh!
ФИБИ: Oh, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. You know? So, like, when the phone rings, and she takes a shower.
НЕДРУГ: That's pretty much it.
ФИБИ: Ooops.
НЕДРУГ: But you tell it really well sweetie.
ФИБИ: Ah. OK, now go away so we can talk about you.
НЕДРУГ: OK, I'll miss you.
ФИБИ: Isn't he great?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's so cute. And he seems to like you so much.
ФИБИ: I know. I know. He's so sweet, and so complicated, you know? And for a shrink, who's not too shrinky?
МОНИКА: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I think that's a little weird. You know, it's vinyl.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK. Any of you guys want anything else?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes. Could I have one of those.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK.
НЕДРУГ: Did I, did I miss something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah. She's still upset because I saw her boobies!
РОСС: Whoa, what, what d. What were you doing seeing her boobies?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was an accident. It's not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK. OK. Can we change the subject, please?
ФИБИ: Yeah, cos, hello, these are not her boobies. These are her breasts!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, Phoebes, I was hoping for more of a change.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, you know, I don't know why you are so embarrassed. They were very nice boobies.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nice? They were, nice? I mean, tha, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK. Rock. Hard place. Me!
НЕДРУГ: You're, you're, you're so funny. He's really funny. I wouldn't wanna be there when, when the laughter stops.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa. Whoa. Back up there sparky. What did you mean by that?
НЕДРУГ: Huh. Just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. You know, that, you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh.
НЕДРУГ: I mean, hey, I just met you! I don't know you from Adam! Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh. How did you know that?
НЕДРУГ: It's textbook.
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys! You all know my dad?
МОНИКА: Hey, how long you in the city?
НЕДРУГ: Just for a couple of days. I got a job mid-town. I figure, I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on a ferry. I don't know this one.
ФИБИ: Oh. This is my friend Roger.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Hey, good to see you Roger.
НЕДРУГ: You too, sir.
НЕДРУГ: What happened to the, er, puppet guy?
ДЖОУИ: Dad! Er.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Oh. Er, excuse me. So, Ross, er, how's the wife?
ДЖОУИ: Uuuuhhh!
НЕДРУГ: Home for two, eh? Er, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
НЕДРУГ: Gotta go. He he he, miss you too. I love you, but it's getting real late, now.
ДЖОУИ: Let me say Hi. Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazeta, and, excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
НЕДРУГ: Her name's Ronnie. She's a pet mortician.
ДЖОУИ: Sure! So how long you been.
НЕДРУГ: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the Navy yard, and show you the big ships?
ДЖОУИ: Since then?
НЕДРУГ: Nah. It's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. Joe. You ever been in love?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know.
НЕДРУГ: Then you haven't. You're burning your tomatoes!
ДЖОУИ: Hah! You're one to talk!
НЕДРУГ: Joe. Your Dad's in love big time, and the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
ДЖОУИ: Oh man. Please tell me one of them is Ma!
НЕДРУГ: Of course one of 'em's Ma! What's the matter with you?
ДЖОУИ: It's, like, if you wake up one day, and found out your dad was leading this, double life. He's, like, actually some spy, working for the CIA. That'd be cool. This blows!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, I know. I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? You know? Why do they have to become people? Why do you have. Why, can't you stop staring at me breasts?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?. What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
РОСС: Alright. Alright. We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, er, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I don't see that happening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm not showing you my tat!
НЕДРУГ: BZZZZZ.
МОНИКА: Hello?
НЕДРУГ: It's Phoebe, and Rog.
МОНИКА: Come on up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good. Rog is here!
ДЖОУИ: What's the matter with Rog?
РОСС: Yeah?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, it's nothing. It's just a little thing. I, I hate that guy!
РОСС: What? So he was a little analytical. That's what he does. You know, come on, he's not that bad.
РОСС: You see. That's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her, if I thought on any level that, that she was a Lesbian?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
НЕДРУГ: Ha ha.
РОСС: Why? Why would I? Why? Why? Why? Why?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe, maybe low self esteem, maybe, maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe.
МОНИКА: W, w, wait. Go back to that sibling thing.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel like less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
РОСС: Dhuh? That's, that's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures.
МОНИКА: Huh huh. So, you think I'm a failure?
ФИБИ: Isn't he great?
РОСС: Yeah. No, no, but, that's not what I was saying.
МОНИКА: You know what, I mean all these years I thought you were on my side, but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad, so they'd keep liking you better.
РОСС: Hey! I married a Lesbian to make you look good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're right. I mean, you're right. It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and, and the Weebles' Cruise Ship, oh, which, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
НЕДРУГ: That's tough, tough stuff. Come on Phoebes. If we're gonna catch that movie, we've got to get going.
ФИБИ: OK. Feel better Rache, OK?
НЕДРУГ: Phoebes! We're gonna be late, sweetie!
ФИБИ: Oh, OK. Listen, thanks for everything Mon.
МОНИКА: No problem.
НЕДРУГ: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again.
РОСС: Uhhh.
НЕДРУГ: Mon, er, easy on those cookies, OK? Remember, they're just food. They're not love.
МОНИКА: I hate that guy!
РОСС: Mmm.
ДЖОУИ: Goodnight, you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, look, it's the woman we ordered.
ДЖОУИ: Hey? Can, er, can we help you?
НЕДРУГ: Ah! No thanks, I'm just waiting for, er, Joey Tribiani.
ДЖОУИ: I, I'm Joey Tribiani.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh my god! You're so much cuter than your pictures! I, I'm Ronnie. Cheese Nip?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Er, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, you know.
НЕДРУГ: Now, you see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want them sort of laid out, like they're sleeping, BUT, occasionally, you get your person who wants them in a pose, like, er, chasin' their tail. Or, er, jumping to catch a Frisbee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.
НЕДРУГ: That's a good one.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Joe.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Dad. Huh. Ronnie's here!
НЕДРУГ: Huh?
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hello babe. Wha, wha, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, er, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for the meeting.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. Er.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So! Who's up for a big game of KerPlunk?
НЕДРУГ: Look, I, er, I, I shouldn't have come. I, I, I better get going, I don't want to miss the last train.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, hon, I don't want you taking that thing this late.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, where am I going to stay? Here?
ДЖОУИ: Woah ho!
НЕДРУГ: We'll go to a hotel.
НЕДРУГ: Go to a hotel.
ДЖОУИ: No you won't.
НЕДРУГ: No we won't.
ДЖОУИ: If you go to a hotel, you'll be doin' stuff. I want you right here, where I can keep an eye on you.
НЕДРУГ: You're gonna keep an eye on us?
ДЖОУИ: That's right mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof, you're gonna live by my rules. And that means, no sleeping with your girlfriend.
НЕДРУГ: Wow. He's strict.
ДЖОУИ: Now Dad, you'll be in my room, Ronnie, er, you can stay in Chandler's room.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. You're, you're a good kid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, I, I'll show you to my room. That sounds so weird when it's not followed by No thanks, it's late.
ДЖОУИ: OK. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you've gotta make a change. Six years is long enough.
НЕДРУГ: What kind of change?
ДЖОУИ: Well, either you break it off with Ronnie.
НЕДРУГ: I can't do that!
ДЖОУИ: Then you've gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
НЕДРУГ: Yea, but, this.
ДЖОУИ: I don't wanna hear it! Now, go to my room!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Kicky! What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: I'm just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you're gonna!
ДЖОУИ: I've been thinking. You know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are they end to end, or tall, like pancakes?
ДЖОУИ: You know what I mean. About how I'm always going out with all these women, and I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand up guy, and go the distance, you know. I'm looking at my Dad, thinking.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you are not him, you're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business, did you cave?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. You decided to go into the out of work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it. And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage, and the guts, to say No thanks. I'm married.
ДЖОУИ: You really think so?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. I really do.
ДЖОУИ: Aw! Thanks Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get off!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Knock, knock.
МОНИКА: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
МОНИКА: May I help you?
НЕДРУГ: Er, yeah, er, Joey said I could use your shower, since, er, Chandler's in ours.
МОНИКА: OK. Who are you?
НЕДРУГ: Oh! I'm, er, Ronnie. Ronnie Rapalato. The mistress?
МОНИКА: Uh-huh. Er, come on in.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, I'm Rachel. The bathroom's up there. Hey, listen Ronnie, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, like, er, five minutes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, great. Fasten your seatbelts. It's pee-pee time!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mr. Trib.
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Good morning, dear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.
ДЖОУИ: What's the matter with you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I thought it was Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wha-what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry. My, my thing was in there with me!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoebes.
МОНИКА: How's it going?
ФИБИ: Good. Oh! Oh! Roger's having a dinner thing, and he wanted me to invite you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh-uh.
ФИБИ: So what's going on?
МОНИКА: Nothing. It's er. It's just, er. It's Roger.
РОСС: I, er, I dunno, there's something about.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Basically we just feel that he's, er.
МОНИКА: We hate that guy!
НЕДРУГ: We hate him!
РОСС: We're sorry Phoebes, we're sorry.
ФИБИ: Ah. Huh. OK. OK, don't you think maybe though that's just that he's so perceptive that it freaked you out?
НЕДРУГ: No. We hate him!
МОНИКА: We're sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
ДЖОУИ: Ma! What are you doin' here?
НЕДРУГ: I came to give you this. And this.
ДЖОУИ: Ow! Big ring!
НЕДРУГ: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were. There's chicken in there, put it away! For god's sake, Joey. Really.
ДЖОУИ: Hold on. You knew?
НЕДРУГ: Of course I knew. Your father is no James Bond! You should have heard some of his cover stories. I sleeping over at my accountants. I mean, what is that? Please.
ДЖОУИ: So then, wha, how could you, I mean, how could you.
НЕДРУГ: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling. Always yelling. Nothing made him happy. Nothing made him happy. Nothing, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
ДЖОУИ: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but what the hell are you talking about? I, I mean, what about you?
НЕДРУГ: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no harm, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself, that he's been attentive, he's been more loving, it's like every day is our anniversary.
ДЖОУИ: I'm happy for you?
НЕДРУГ: Well don't be! Because now everything is screwed up! I just want it the way it was.
ДЖОУИ: Ma. I'm sorry. I, I just did what I thought you'd want.
НЕДРУГ: I know you did cookie, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
НЕДРУГ: That's sweet. Could I take her?
ДЖОУИ: With this ring? No contest!
НЕДРУГ: What's wrong sweetie?
ФИБИ: Nothing. Nothing.
НЕДРУГ: Now, now, now, what's wrong, come on?
ФИБИ: OK. It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's just, er, it's my friends. They, they have a liking problem with you. In that, er, they don't.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. They don't.
ФИБИ: But, you know, they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see, you know, they don't see all the, all the good stuff, and all the sweet stuff. They just, you know, they think you're a little.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Intense and creepy.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ФИБИ: But I don't. Me. Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm not, I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
ФИБИ: You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
НЕДРУГ: Actually, it's, it's quite, you know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of, co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house, with your stupid big cups, which I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're all, like, Oh, define me! Define me! Love me! I need love!
МОНИКА: So, you talk to your dad, huh?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my Ma, like she wanted. My Ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know, even though she does, and my little sister Tina, can't see her husband any more, cos he got a restraining order, which has nothing to do with anything, except that I found out today.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Things sure have changed here on Walton's Mountain.
РОСС: So, Joey, you OK?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I guess, it's just, you know, they're parents, after a certain point you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just think. In a couple of years we get to turn into them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blonde, chasing after twenty-year old boys, or I'll end up like my Mom!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoebes!
МОНИКА: How's it going?
ФИБИ: Oh, OK. Except I broke up with Roger.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhh!
ФИБИ: Yeah, right!
НЕДРУГ: No, no. Ahhhhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What happened?
ФИБИ: I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet. And in some ways, I think he is so right for me. It's just, I hate that guy!
ФИБИ: Hey, Joey. What's going on?
ДЖОУИ: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop, Rachel Green.
МОНИКА: Joey! What the hell were you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Sorry. Wrong boobies.
МОНИКА: Hello Joey.
НЕДРУГ: Hello dear.
