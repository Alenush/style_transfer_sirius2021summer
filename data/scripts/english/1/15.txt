НЕДРУГ: Rach, why does my swizzel stick have an eraser? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! That's why. I'm sorry! 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: Ms. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys, guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know... 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Never mind. But it was going to be really good. 
РОСС: What's going on? 
НЕДРУГ: What is it? 
НЕДРУГ: So, it's a typical day at work. I'm putting in my numbers, and then big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. 
НЕДРУГ: That's great! 
НЕДРУГ: So.... I quit. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Chandler... you've been there for five years. 
НЕДРУГ: If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. 
НЕДРУГ: So was it a lot more money? 
НЕДРУГ: It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS. 
НЕДРУГ: ... the WENUS? 
НЕДРУГ: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. That WENUS. 
ДЖОУИ: So what're you going to do? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. 
НЕДРУГ: Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef. 
НЕДРУГ: Um... hi there. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know! Well, what do you think? 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks, Phoeb. But I just don't see myself in a big white hat. 
НЕДРУГ: OK. Hey Monica! Guess what! 
НЕДРУГ: Can you see my nipples through this shirt? 
НЕДРУГ: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there. 
НЕДРУГ: Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo". 
НЕДРУГ: Work counselor? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you guys all know what you want to do. 
НЕДРУГ: I don't! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. 
РОСС: Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I love my life, I love my life! 
НЕДРУГ: Ooh! Brian's Song! 
НЕДРУГ: The meeting with the guy went great? 
НЕДРУГ: So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. 
НЕДРУГ: Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? 
НЕДРУГ: So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises. 
НЕДРУГ: What are you going to make? 
НЕДРУГ: Yummy noises. 
НЕДРУГ: And Monica, what are you going to make? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great! 
НЕДРУГ: Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. 
РОСС: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood? 
ДЖОУИ: How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free. 
РОСС: OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? 
НЕДРУГ: Who are you going out with? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, is this the bug lady? 
НЕДРУГ: Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross. 
РОСС: Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum. 
НЕДРУГ: So what are you guys going to do? 
РОСС: Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I might introduce her to my monkey. 
НЕДРУГ: And he's not speaking metaphorically. 
ДЖОУИ: So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh? 
РОСС: Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh. 
ДЖОУИ: I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. 
РОСС: He's not going to hurt you! Keep going, Celia. Marcel... 
НЕДРУГ: I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my... 
РОСС: Alright... 
НЕДРУГ: OK, try this salmon mousse. 
ДЖОУИ: Mmmm. Good. 
НЕДРУГ: Is it better than the other salmon mousse? 
ДЖОУИ: It's creamier. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, is that better? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? 
НЕДРУГ: My God! What happened to you? 
НЕДРУГ: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation." 
НЕДРУГ: That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that! 
НЕДРУГ: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing... something. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, maybe this'll cheer you up. 
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. 
НЕДРУГ: It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche. 
НЕДРУГ: Well.... it is amouz-ing... 
НЕДРУГ: Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. 
НЕДРУГ: Ten dollars an hour for what? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out. 
НЕДРУГ: Waitressing? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but... 
НЕДРУГ: But, but? 
НЕДРУГ: But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche? 
НЕДРУГ: Talk to me. 
РОСС: OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning... 
НЕДРУГ: No no no. Talk... dirty. 
РОСС: Wha... what, here? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes... 
РОСС: Ah.... 
НЕДРУГ: Say something..... hot. 
РОСС: Er.... um..... 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РОСС: Um... uh.... vulva. 
ДЖОУИ: Vulva? 
РОСС: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?? 
РОСС: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know? 
ДЖОУИ: What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. 
РОСС: Please be kidding. 
ДЖОУИ: Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. 
РОСС: OK. I'm in my apartment... 
ДЖОУИ: ....yeah... what else? 
РОСС: That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, look, I'll start, OK? 
РОСС: Joey, please. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. 
РОСС: Wow. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, now you say something. 
РОСС: I... ahem... I really don't think so. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on! You like this woman, right? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: You want to see her again, right? 
РОСС: Sure. 
ДЖОУИ: Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt! 
РОСС: OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead. 
РОСС: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips. 
ДЖОУИ: There you go! Keep going. Keep going! 
РОСС: I, er... 
РОСС: I want to take my tongue... and... 
РОСС: ....and.... 
ДЖОУИ: Say it... say it! 
РОСС: ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with... 
НЕДРУГ: ....with?? 
РОСС: Funny story! 
НЕДРУГ: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again. 
НЕДРУГ: Again? 
ДЖОУИ: And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?... Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?... Well, that's very generous... er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?... Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!.... No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! 
НЕДРУГ: Well? 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. 
НЕДРУГ: Look at this! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! You have a window! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh look! That guy's peeing! 
НЕДРУГ: OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. 
НЕДРУГ: OK. 
НЕДРУГ: This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment? 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you Helen, that'll be all. 
НЕДРУГ: Last time I do that, I promise. 
НЕДРУГ: Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! 
НЕДРУГ: Who was that? 
НЕДРУГ: Wendy bailed. I have no waitress. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. 
НЕДРУГ: Ten dollars an hour. 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Twelve dollars an hour. 
НЕДРУГ: Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour. 
НЕДРУГ: Done. 
НЕДРУГ: Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat? 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Steve! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl. 
НЕДРУГ: This is Rachel. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, OK. 
НЕДРУГ: Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells. 
НЕДРУГ: It's a lovely apartment. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour? 
НЕДРУГ: I was just being polite, but, alright. 
НЕДРУГ: What's up? 
НЕДРУГ: In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja? 
НЕДРУГ: OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK. 
НЕДРУГ: Is it dry in here? 
НЕДРУГ: No. Let me get you some wine! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, slap my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm so glad you liked them! 
НЕДРУГ: Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well... um, that's all there are of those. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets. 
НЕДРУГ: Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything? 
НЕДРУГ: You know, I don't know what I'm looking for. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope. 
НЕДРУГ: You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Sugar-O's! 
НЕДРУГ: You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes... 
НЕДРУГ: Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this! 
НЕДРУГ: No, we don't. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, OK. Oh, sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears. 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Give them to me. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, we'll share. 
НЕДРУГ: No, give me the... 
НЕДРУГ: Well then you can't have any. Man overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! 
НЕДРУГ: That's it! Dinner is over! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: What a tool! 
НЕДРУГ: You don't want to work for a guy like that. 
НЕДРУГ: I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it. 
РОСС: Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking. 
ДЖОУИ: So, er... how did it go with Celia? 
РОСС: Oh, I was unbelievable. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, Ross! 
РОСС: I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were different characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! And the... huh-huh? 
РОСС: Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so... 
ДЖОУИ: You cuddled. 
РОСС: Yeah, which was nice. 
НЕДРУГ: You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something? 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, where the hell is he? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa.... 
НЕДРУГ: How's this? 
НЕДРУГ: Eeeee! 
НЕДРУГ: How about over here? 
НЕДРУГ: Aaaaah! 
НЕДРУГ: See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: What about this?
