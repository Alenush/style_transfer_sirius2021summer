МОНИКА: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
ДЖОУИ: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
ФИБИ: Wait, does he eat chalk?
ФИБИ: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl oh!
МОНИКА: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds like a date to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone, there.
ДЖОУИ: Instead of?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's right.
ДЖОУИ: Never had that dream.
ФИБИ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because she never calls me!
РОСС: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
МОНИКА: Are you okay, sweetie?
РОСС: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cookie?
МОНИКА: Carol moved her stuff out today. Let me get you some coffee.
ФИБИ: Ooh! Oh!
РОСС: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
МОНИКА: No you don't.
РОСС: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
ДЖОУИ: And you never knew she was a lesbian.
РОСС: No! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. Did I say that out loud?
ДЖОУИ: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
ДЖОУИ: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
РОСС: I don't want to be single, okay? I just. I just I just wanna be married again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I just want a million dollars!
МОНИКА: Rachel?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
НЕДРУГ: Can I get you some coffee?
МОНИКА: De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, sure!
РОСС: Hi.
МОНИКА: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden Sweet 'n' Lo? I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but. Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
МОНИКА: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
МОНИКА: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Daddy, I just. I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
ДЖОУИ: I say push her down the stairs.
НЕДРУГ: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a a purse, y'know? Or a or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha It's a metaphor, Daddy!
РОСС: You can see where he'd have trouble.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
МОНИКА: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait! Wait, I said maybe!
МОНИКА: Just breathe, breathe, that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things.
ФИБИ: Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens. La la la.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm all better now.
ФИБИ: I helped!
МОНИКА: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.
ДЖОУИ: And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
МОНИКА: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
ДЖОУИ: What, like there's a rule or something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
НЕДРУГ: It's, uh, it's Paul.
МОНИКА: Buzz him in!
ДЖОУИ: Who's Paul?
РОСС: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
МОНИКА: Maybe.
ДЖОУИ: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
РОСС: He finally asked you out?
МОНИКА: Yes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
МОНИКА: Rach, wait, I can cancel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
МОНИКА: Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
РОСС: That'd be good.
МОНИКА: Really?
РОСС: No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
МОНИКА: Hi, come in! Paul, this is, everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
МОНИКА: Two seconds.
ФИБИ: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
РОСС: So Rachel, what're you, uh, what're you up to tonight?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
РОСС: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year, talk about your -big lizards. Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and we're very excited about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
РОСС: Okay, sure.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
ФИБИ: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
РОСС: I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.
ДЖОУИ: What's this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have no idea.
ДЖОУИ: Done with the bookcase!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All finished!
РОСС: This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
РОСС: You guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, man.
ДЖОУИ: You got screwed.
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
МОНИКА: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her.
МОНИКА: leg?
НЕДРУГ: That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
МОНИКА: You actually broke her watch?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't, it isn't, it's about me, and I ju Hi, machine cut me off again, anyway.
РОСС: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman for her.
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
РОСС: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stay out of my freezer!
НЕДРУГ: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh.
МОНИКА: What?. What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
НЕДРУГ: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
МОНИКА: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
НЕДРУГ: Isn't there?
МОНИКА: Yeah, yeah, I think there is. What were you gonna say?
НЕДРУГ: Well, ever-ev-, ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. Sexually.
МОНИКА: Oh God, oh God, I am sorry. I am so sorry.
НЕДРУГ: It's okay.
МОНИКА: Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um, how long?
НЕДРУГ: Two years.
МОНИКА: Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch!
НЕДРУГ: So you still think you, um, might want that fifth date?
МОНИКА: Yeah. Yeah, I do.
НЕДРУГ: 'I, Joanie, take you, Charles, to be my lawful husband.' 'Do you take.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh see, but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!
РОСС: Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to to ask a woman out,, who am I gonna ask?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is amazing.
ДЖОУИ: Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something. Although actually I'm really not that hungry.
НЕДРУГ: Morning. Good morning.
НЕДРУГ: Morning.
ДЖОУИ: Morning, Paul.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello, Paul.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, Paul, is it?
МОНИКА: I had a really great time last night.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. Thank you so much.
МОНИКА: We'll talk later.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
МОНИКА: Shut up, and put my table back.
НЕДРУГ: Okayyy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,, it doesn't make much of a difference.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, like, you guys all have jobs?
МОНИКА: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I'm an actor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
ДЖОУИ: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
МОНИКА: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
ДЖОУИ: I will not take this abuse.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're right, I'm sorry. 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy.'
МОНИКА: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
МОНИКА: I know, he's just so, so. Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah.
МОНИКА: Well, it's like that. With feelings.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
МОНИКА: Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, look, wish me luck!
МОНИКА: What for?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Monica!
МОНИКА: Hey, welcome back! How was Florida?
НЕДРУГ: You had sex, didn't you?
МОНИКА: How do you do that?
НЕДРУГ: So? Who?
МОНИКА: You know Paul?
НЕДРУГ: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
МОНИКА: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
НЕДРУГ: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
ДЖОУИ: Of course it was a line!
МОНИКА: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
РОСС: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
МОНИКА: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
ФИБИ: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
МОНИКА: I just thought he was nice, y'know?
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Guess what?
РОСС: You got a job?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, how well you know me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
МОНИКА: How'd you pay for them?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, credit card.
МОНИКА: And who pays for that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, my, father.
МОНИКА: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know that. That's why I was getting married.
ФИБИ: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
ФИБИ: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
РОСС: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'.
МОНИКА: You ready?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't think so.
РОСС: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,
НЕДРУГ: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
МОНИКА: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
МОНИКА: Well, that's it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You gonna crash on the couch?
РОСС: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
МОНИКА: You be okay?
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
МОНИКА: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
РОСС: Mmm. Oh, no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry.
РОСС: No no no, go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you have it, really, I don't want it.
РОСС: Split it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I knew.
РОСС: You did! Oh. I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did.
РОСС: Oh. Listen, do you think and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, maybe.
РОСС: Okay, okay, maybe I will.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Goodnight.
РОСС: Goodnight.
МОНИКА: See ya. Waitwait, what's with you?
РОСС: I just grabbed a spoon.
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
ФИБИ: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
МОНИКА: What? II said you had a.
ФИБИ: What I said.
МОНИКА: Would you stop?
ФИБИ: Oh, was I doing it again?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would anybody like more coffee?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm just serving it.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kids, new dream. I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli.
