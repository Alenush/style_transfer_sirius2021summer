МОНИКА: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, right! Y'serious?
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
МОНИКА: Absolutely.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
РОСС: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that, that's not why we bought the ticket.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic, basically just trying to stay awake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
ДЖОУИ: Are we still talking about sex?
РОСС: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that mm doesn't she seem a little angry?
НЕДРУГ: Well, she has issues.
РОСС: Does she.
НЕДРУГ: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
РОСС: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
НЕДРУГ: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
РОСС: No. No.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
РОСС: Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
РОСС:Hi.
НЕДРУГ: So.
РОСС: You look great. I, uh. I hate that.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. You look good too.
РОСС: Ah, well, in here, anyone who, stands erect. So what's new? Still, uh.
НЕДРУГ: A lesbian?
РОСС: Well, you never know. How's, um, how's the family?
НЕДРУГ: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh.
РОСС: Why why are you here, Carol?
НЕДРУГ: I'm pregnant.
РОСС: Pregnant?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
ФИБИ: Then I've already seen this one!
МОНИКА: Are you through with that?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
МОНИКА: Whose little ball of paper is this?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and, now I wish I was dead.
ФИБИ: She's already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that -but, it's fine!
МОНИКА: Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
ФИБИ: Monica Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
МОНИКА: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ew, ew, ew, ew ew!
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
НЕДРУГ: Eeaagh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
ФИБИ: Yeah, it's beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.
ФИБИ: No, look, don't touch that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him. 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder.
МОНИКА: Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
ФИБИ: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dinah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhhh, don't be mad.
МОНИКА: You didn't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I am sorry.
МОНИКА: I gave you one job!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne.
МОНИКА: I just, can't do it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Boys? We're going in.
РОСС: Hi.
МОНИКА: Wow. That is not a happy hi.
РОСС: Carol's pregnant.
ФИБИ: Ooh! I found it!
МОНИКА: W-w-wh-, wha-, w-w-w-.
РОСС: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
РОСС: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved, basically it's entirely up to me.
ФИБИ: She is so great! I miss her.
МОНИКА: What does she mean by 'involved'?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
РОСС: Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what are you gonna do?
РОСС: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
ДЖОУИ: Well, this is still ruined, right?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
МОНИКА: Curry.
НЕДРУГ: Mmmm!
РОСС: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
НЕДРУГ: Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
НЕДРУГ: They all had a thing for him.
РОСС: Aw, Mom.
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or. I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant.
МОНИКА: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
НЕДРУГ: Well, they don't have to know that.
МОНИКА: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's, easy.
МОНИКА: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
НЕДРУГ: What that Rachel did to her life. We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding, but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
НЕДРУГ: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
МОНИКА: What's that supposed to mean?
НЕДРУГ: Nothing! It's an expression.
МОНИКА: No it's not.
НЕДРУГ: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid, and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles.
НЕДРУГ: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
НЕДРУГ: And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
МОНИКА: So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
РОСС: Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
НЕДРУГ: And you knew about this?!
ДЖОУИ: Your folks are really that bad, huh?
РОСС: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
МОНИКА: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,, boy, if you could I'd want yours.
РОСС: Must pee.
ФИБИ: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're twins?
ФИБИ: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does she do?
ФИБИ: She's a waitress.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who, my parents actually preferred.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The lights, please.
РОСС: How long was I in there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm just cleaning up.
РОСС: D'ya, uh, d'ya need any help?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, okay, sure! Thanks!
РОСС: Anyway, um. So, you uh you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, a little.
РОСС: Mm-hmm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A lot.
РОСС: Mm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been dumped?
РОСС: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB GYN.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow. When did it get so complicated?
РОСС: Got me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Remember when we were in high school together?
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love and that'd be it?. Ross?
РОСС: Yes, yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.
РОСС: Me either.
РОСС: Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur, thing, anyway.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, you remember Susan.
РОСС: How could I forget?
НЕДРУГ: Ross.
РОСС: Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for?
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Oberman.
РОСС: Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he.
НЕДРУГ: She.
РОСС: she, of course, she uh familiar with our, special situation?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, and she's very supportive.
РОСС: Okay, that's great. No, I'm Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
РОСС: Quack, quack.
НЕДРУГ: Ross? That opens my cervix.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Barry?
НЕДРУГ: C'mon in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you sure?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
НЕДРУГ: Huh?!
НЕДРУГ: So, how ya doin?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm uh I'm okay. You look great!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
НЕДРУГ: Be right there. Be back in a sec.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dumped him.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: So, um so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
НЕДРУГ: Give me a 'for instance'.
РОСС: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
НЕДРУГ: Marlon.
РОСС: Marlon?!
НЕДРУГ: if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
РОСС: As in Mouse?
НЕДРУГ: As in my grandmother.
РОСС: Still, you you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um, how about Julia?
НЕДРУГ: Julia.
НЕДРУГ: We agreed on Minnie.
РОСС: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table?
НЕДРУГ: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, not much. II got a job.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why are why are you so tanned?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I, uh I went to Aruba.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
НЕДРУГ: No. I went with, uh. Now, this may hurt.
НЕДРУГ: Me?!
НЕДРУГ: No! I went with Mindy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Well, um. You've got plugs!
НЕДРУГ: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
НЕДРУГ: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow.
НЕДРУГ: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
НЕДРУГ: Well, thank you for giving it back.
НЕДРУГ: Hello?!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
РОСС: Helen Geller? I don't think so.
НЕДРУГ: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
РОСС: Thank you!
НЕДРУГ: No, I mean it's not Geller.
РОСС: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
НЕДРУГ: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen WillickBunch.
РОСС: Well, wait a minute, wha why is she in the title?
НЕДРУГ: It's my baby too.
РОСС: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
НЕДРУГ: All right, you two, stop it!
РОСС: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
НЕДРУГ: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen WillickBunchGeller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
РОСС: Of course not, I'm, suggesting GellerWillickBunch.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
РОСС: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do.
НЕДРУГ: Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Yeah. A little.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back.
РОСС: You uh y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
РОСС: Oh my God.
НЕДРУГ: Look at that.
НЕДРУГ: I know.
РОСС: Well? Isn't that amazing?
ДЖОУИ: What are we supposed to be seeing here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dunno, but. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
ФИБИ: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
РОСС: Then don't do that, alright?
ФИБИ: Okay!
РОСС: Monica. Whaddya think?
МОНИКА: Mm-hmm.
РОСС: Wh are you welling up?
МОНИКА: No.
РОСС: You are, you're welling up.
МОНИКА: Am not!
РОСС: You're gonna be an aunt.
МОНИКА: Oh shut up!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. II saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel SO much better now.
