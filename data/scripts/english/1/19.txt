РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, OK, I checked, we have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and er, oh wait, there was one more, erm, Lemon Soother! 
НЕДРУГ: 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're not the guy who asked for the tea, are you? .... OK. 
МОНИКА: Mail call. Rachel Green. Bunk 7. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you...Oh cool. Free sample of coffee. 
МОНИКА: Oh good, 'cos where else would we get any? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Right.... Oh great. 
МОНИКА: What is it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration.... Oh my god... Oh my god, it's Barry and Mindy! 
МОНИКА: Barry who you almost...? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Barry who I almost... 
МОНИКА: And Mindy your maid of...? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mindy my maid of... 
МОНИКА: Let me see... That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty.... lucky.... to have had a friend like you! 
РОСС: Marcel, bring me the rice! Come on! Bring me the rice! Come on! Good boy! Good boy! Come on, give me the rice!.... Thank you. Good boy! Ah I see he's finally mastered the difference between "bring me the" and "pee in the".... "Bring me the" and... Rache? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I'm sorry. Oh. This is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? 
РОСС: Mmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I should be happy for them.... I am. I'm happy for them. 
РОСС: Really? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.... Oh.... Oh, I guess it'd be different if I were, with somebody. 
РОСС: Whoa. What, er, what happened to, er, "forget relationships", "I'm done with men", the whole, er, penis embargo? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. I don't know. I guess it's not about "no guys", it's about the "right guy" you know? 
РОСС: Mmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean with Barry, it was, it was safe, and it was easy, but there was no heat. 
РОСС: Mmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know with Paulo, that all there was, was heat. I, I mean it was just this raw, animal, sexual... 
РОСС: Right, right. I, I got it. I was there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah. I mean, do you think you can ever have both? You know, someone who's, like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl? 
РОСС: Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Yes! I do! I really do! Er, in fact, it's funny. Very often, someone who you wouldn't think could, could, curl your toes, might just be the one who, er, who... 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
РОСС: ...gets interrupted! Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey guys, how was the movie? 
ФИБИ: Oh, it was so good. 
МОНИКА: Wonderful. 
ДЖОУИ: Suckfest! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Total chick-flick! 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, you know, like guns and bombs and like buses going really fast. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. I don't need violence to enjoy a movie, just so long as there's a little nudity. 
МОНИКА: There was nudity! 
ДЖОУИ: I meant female nudity! Alright, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking! 
НЕДРУГ: Hugh! Hugh Grant! 
РОСС: Alright. I've gotta go. Come on Marcel, come on. Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes we are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're still just friends, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I will see you tomorrow! 
РОСС: That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you? Huh? 
МОНИКА: Huh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this? 
РОСС: Pwease Aunt Monica, Pwease! Oh. Unclench. You're not even gonna be here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I cannot believe we are even having this discussion. 
ДЖОУИ: I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would have, happened already? 
РОСС: I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me. 
ДЖОУИ: She really said that? 
РОСС: Well, I added the "exactly like me" part, but she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: Tonight, tonight? 
РОСС: Well, I think it's perfect, you know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she's spent all day taking care of my monkey... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. 
ДЖОУИ: 
РОСС: Anyway, you know, I figured after work, I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there, and, er, try to woo her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. You know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's when that phrase was last used. 
НЕДРУГ: You keep this up honey, and I swear, you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr.Francis, now she used to be a man. OK? Oh look see, now there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. An... Wh... M... Marcel? Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to p...Whoa! Whoa! Marcel? Did you poo in the shoe? Oh my god. Bad, bad. Oh god. Oh. Sorry Barry. A little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that! 
НЕДРУГ: 
ДЖОУИ: How could you loose him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I don't know, we were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe... 
МОНИКА: Wait... He pooped in my shoe? Which one? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know... The left one. 
МОНИКА: Which ones? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh, those little clunkly Amish things you think go with everything. 
ФИБИ: Hey, hi. Whoa, oh, why is the air in here so negative? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rachel lost Marcel. 
ФИБИ: Oh no, how? 
МОНИКА: He, he pooped in my shoe. 
ФИБИ: Which one? 
МОНИКА: Those cute little black ones I wear all the time. 
ФИБИ: No. Which one? The right or left? Cos the left one is lucky... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on you guys, what am I going to do? What are we going to do? 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, alright, alright, you're a monkey, you're loose in the city... Where do you go? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK. It's his first time out, so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things... I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian tea-room. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god. Come on you guys. He's gonna be home any minute. He's gonna kill me. 
МОНИКА: OK. We'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I will take third and fourth. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wha, wha, wh, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? 
МОНИКА: OK. You stay here. You just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Does anybody wanna trade? Oh. 
МОНИКА: 
НЕДРУГ: What do you want? 
МОНИКА: Mr.Heckles. Our, our friends lost a monkey. Have you seen it? 
НЕДРУГ: I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it? 
МОНИКА: No! 
ФИБИ: Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? 
НЕДРУГ: I wasn't ready for it. 
МОНИКА: The monkey? Have you seen a monkey? 
НЕДРУГ: Saw Regis Philbin once... 
ФИБИ: OK. Thank you Mr.Heckles 
НЕДРУГ: You owe me a waffle. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK. He's a, he's a black Capuchin monkey, with a white face... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...with, with Russian dressing, and pickles on the side. OK. Thanks... Hi! 
РОСС: Hi. Hey, how did it go today? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, great! It went great. Really great... Hey! Is that wine? 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah. You, er, you want some? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I would love some, but you know what? You know what? Let's not drink it here... I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark? 
РОСС: Er... OK... Yeah. We can do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North East, I was, er, kinda wanted to run something by you... You know how we were, er, you know, talking before, about, er, relationships and stuff, well... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god, Ross. I cannot do this... 
РОСС: OK. Quick and painful. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god. OK. Alright, alright. OK. Ross, please don't hate me... 
РОСС: No, why? What, what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah. You know Marcel? 
РОСС: Yeah? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I, kinda , kind of lost him... 
РОСС: I, I, I can't, I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know, I'm sorry... 
РОСС: No, no. You know what? I guess it's partially my fault, you know, I shouldn't have asked you to, er, start off with a monkey. I should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross. I'm doing everything that I can. I've got everybody looking for him, and then I... 
НЕДРУГ: BZZZZZ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who is it? 
НЕДРУГ: Animal Control. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See, I've even got Animal Control... 
РОСС: You've called Animal Control? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. Why? Do you not like them? 
РОСС: Huh! Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK. Well, now, see, you never ever ever told us that... 
РОСС: That's right, cos I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Thanks for coming! 
НЕДРУГ: Somebody called about a monkey? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh yeah! You know what? That was a complete misunderstanding. 
РОСС: Yeah. We, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It turned out it was a hat! 
РОСС: Cat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cat! What did I say? Cat. 
МОНИКА: Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel. 
НЕДРУГ: Marcel? 
РОСС: My uncle Marcel... 
ФИБИ: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after? 
НЕДРУГ: OK. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, er, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal? 
ФИБИ: Oh my god. You'd put that poor little creature in jail? 
МОНИКА: Phoebes? You remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? 
ФИБИ: Yes, but there isn't always time... 
МОНИКА: Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Erm, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced. I, I'm Monica Geller... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god, you are! And you're Rachel Green! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Louisa Jeanette. Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in, in homeroom! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Louisa? Oh my god! Monica! It's Louisa! 
МОНИКА: Louisa! From homeroom! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! 
НЕДРУГ: You have no idea who I am, do you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
МОНИКА: Not at all. 
НЕДРУГ: Well. Maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say "Morning Louisa" or "nice overalls"? 
МОНИКА: Oh, I'm so sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Nah. It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems... But you! What a bitch! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: WHAT? 
МОНИКА: Alright, you know what? Be that as it may, you think you could help us out here on that monkey thing? You know, just for old time's sake? "Go Bobcats!" 
НЕДРУГ: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey... He's mine! 
ФИБИ: Dun, dun, dun... Sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marcel? 
ДЖОУИ: Marcel? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marcel? 
ДЖОУИ: Marcel? 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. Can I help you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ! 
ДЖОУИ: ! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Er, we're kind of having an emergency, and we were, er, looking for something. 
ДЖОУИ: A monkey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Have you seen any? 
НЕДРУГ: No. No. Haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure, sure. Did you, er, did you try turning the knob back the other way? 
НЕДРУГ: Of course. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah, then, no. 
НЕДРУГ: Taste this... Is there too much rum in here? 
НЕДРУГ: Just a sec. I hope you find your monkey... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, wait, wait, no, wait, wait. Erm, we may not know anything about radiators, per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling milieu... 
ДЖОУИ: Er, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help... And they're very hot! 
ДЖОУИ: We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK. From now on, you don't get to talk to other people. 
ДЖОУИ: Marcel! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Marcel! 
МОНИКА: Marcel? 
ФИБИ: Marcel? 
МОНИКА: Marcel? 
ФИБИ: Oh my god! . Something just brushed up against my right leg! 
МОНИКА: What is it? 
ФИБИ: Oh, oh. It's OK! It was just my left leg. 
МОНИКА: Look, Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel, come here. Oh come here Marcel... 
НЕДРУГ: Step aside ladies... 
МОНИКА: What are you gonna do? 
НЕДРУГ: Just a small tranquilliser... 
МОНИКА: Run Marcel! Run! Run Marcel! 
НЕДРУГ: Damn 
МОНИКА: Are you OK? 
ФИБИ: Yes, huh, I think so. I just... Oh! ... Huh!... Whoa! 
РОСС: Marcel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Marcel! 
РОСС: Marcel! Ah, this is ridiculous. We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone. He's, he's just gone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross, you don't know that. 
РОСС: Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark. He doesn't know the village... ... And now I have a broken foot! Thank you very much! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry, like, a million times. What do you want me to do? Huh? What do you want, you want me to break my foot too? Is that it? OK, here, I'm gonna break my foot, right now, there... ... Ow! Oh god, oh my god! There, are you happy now? 
РОСС: Yeah. Yeah. You know, now that you kicked the sign, hey, I don't miss Marcel any more! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know? It's not like I did this on purpose... 
РОСС: No, no, no. No, no. This is just vintage "Rachel". I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in "Rachel Land", doing your "Rachel Thing", totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to peoples feelings, and you... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross. 
РОСС: I don't even want to hear it... No you're always... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! 
РОСС: Oh, forget it, OK? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ROSS! 
РОСС: What, what, what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! Bananaman! 
ФИБИ: Oh. This is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea! 
РОСС: Hi! Did you order some bananas? 
НЕДРУГ: What about it? 
РОСС: Give me my monkey back! 
НЕДРУГ: I don't have a monkey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then what's with all the bananas? 
НЕДРУГ: Potassium. 
РОСС: Marcel? Marcel? OK. Where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? 
РОСС: Marcel! What have you done to him? 
НЕДРУГ: That's my monkey. That's Patty. Patty the Monkey. 
РОСС: Are you insane? Come here Marcel, come on. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on Patty. 
РОСС: Come here Marcel. 
НЕДРУГ: Come here Patty. 
НЕДРУГ: Here monkey! Here monkey! Here monkey! . Gotcha! 
РОСС: OK. Give me my monkey back! 
НЕДРУГ: That's my monkey. 
НЕДРУГ: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge. 
НЕДРУГ: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine. You can send it back whenever. 
РОСС: Alright. I want my monkey! 
НЕДРУГ: No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on, Louisa. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry Prom Queen. 
РОСС: You had to be a bitch in high school. You couldn't have been fat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, look, OK. In high school, I was the Prom Queen, and I was the Homecoming Queen, and the class president, and you... were also there. If you take this monkey, I will loose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. Come on Louisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here. Take it! 
НЕДРУГ: ... No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart? 
РОСС: Hey, It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it... or we can leave it on for now. That's fine... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit! 
РОСС: Listen. I'm... I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, you know, I just... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, come on. No, no, it was my fault. I almost lost your... 
РОСС: No, no. Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, you know, you, you, you were great... Hey, we, er, we still have that, er, that bottle of wine... You in the mood for something grape? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure. That'll be good. 
РОСС: Alright. Er (Gets wine, glasses, and turns down the lights...... The, er, the neighbours must be vacuuming! Well, er, so long as we're here, and, er, not on the subject, erm, I was thinking about, er, how mad we got at each other... before... and, erm, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, er, how we... 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Barry? 
НЕДРУГ: I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ! 
РОСС: !... We have got to start locking that door! 
МОНИКА: This is me in "The Sound of Music"... You see the Von-Trapp kids? 
ФИБИ: No. 
МОНИКА: That's because I'm in front of them! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow. I thought that was an Alp! 
МОНИКА: Well, high school was not my favourite time. 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. I loved high school. You know, it was just, like, four years of parties, and dating, and sex... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would have involved a major lifestyle choice! 
МОНИКА: Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?..... 
ФИБИ: Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my butt cheek is waking up! Oh!
