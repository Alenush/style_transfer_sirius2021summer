ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now.
ДЖОУИ: There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's Phoebe! Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi. Ok, will that be all?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait, wait! WhWhat are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, um, I was over there, and then you said excuse me, hello miss, so now I'm here.
ДЖОУИ: No, no how come are you working here?
НЕДРУГ: Right, yeah, 'cause it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can we start over?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Ok, great. I'm gonna be over here.
НЕДРУГ: No no no!
РОСС: I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, I've done that.
РОСС: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I've never done that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.
ДЖОУИ: I'm sayin' I see a difference.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're twins!
ДЖОУИ: I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's-hot!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things. Let's not do that anymore.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
ФИБИ: Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson.
ДЖОУИ: Nope.
ФИБИ: Morly Safer.
ДЖОУИ: Nope.
ФИБИ: The woman who cuts my hair!
МОНИКА: Ok, look, this could be a really long game.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your sister Ursula.
ФИБИ: Oh, really.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh.
ФИБИ: Riff's. Yeah, I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years.
ФИБИ: Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat?
ДЖОУИ: Not from where I was standin'.
ФИБИ: Where were you standing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?
ФИБИ: It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like yeah, right, well what else is new?
РОСС: Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in gym.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
РОСС: No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, isn't that gonna be weird?
РОСС: No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
МОНИКА: Ross, that's my jacket.
РОСС: I know.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, we're the Rostins. I'm J. C, and he's Michael, and we're having a boy, and a girl.
НЕДРУГ: Good for you. Next?
РОСС: I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's. Who's next?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Susan is Carol's-?
РОСС: Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend.
НЕДРУГ: Life partner.
РОСС: Like buddies.
НЕДРУГ: Like lovers.
РОСС: You know how close women can get.
НЕДРУГ: Susan and I live together.
РОСС: Although I was married to her.
НЕДРУГ: Carol, not me.
РОСС: Right.
НЕДРУГ: It's a little complicated.
РОСС: A little.
НЕДРУГ: But we're fine.
РОСС: Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And to you too, Helen.
НЕДРУГ: Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, ok. Send her in.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, Nina. Come on in.
НЕДРУГ: You wanted to see me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers.
НЕДРУГ: Which is bad because-?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
НЕДРУГ: Your-Excuse me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, right. Gotcha. It won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your. WENUS.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's not just that she's cute, ok. It's just that she's really really cute.
РОСС: It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
МОНИКА: Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
РОСС: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote.
МОНИКА: Great.
РОСС: Relax, I'll fix it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, cool. Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.
РОСС: How did he do this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
МОНИКА: No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well someone was supposed to write Rache, take down the lights and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, where you been?
ДЖОУИ: I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Score.
ДЖОУИ: She is so hot.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, listen. Before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by, uh-.
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister?
ФИБИ: Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why?
ДЖОУИ: So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
ФИБИ: Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not?
ДЖОУИ: Cool, thanks.
РОСС: You ok?
ФИБИ: Yeah I'm fine.
РОСС: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
РОСС: Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol?
НЕДРУГ: Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
РОСС: No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, good. This'll be fun.
НЕДРУГ: All righty. We're gonna start with some basic first-stage breathing exercises, so Mommies, why don't you get on your backs, and coaches, you should be supporting Mommy's head.
РОСС: What? What?
НЕДРУГ: What? What?
НЕДРУГ: I am supposed to be the mommy?
РОСС: Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
НЕДРУГ: Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
РОСС: I see. So what do you propose to do?
НЕДРУГ: I will flip you for it.
РОСС: Flip me for it? No, no, no-heads, heads!
НЕДРУГ: On your back, Mom.
НЕДРУГ: All right, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath. Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mr. D, how's it going, sir?
НЕДРУГ: It's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And?
НЕДРУГ: It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what does this mean?
НЕДРУГ: Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very.
НЕДРУГ: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
НЕДРУГ: Are you ok?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes I am. Listen, the reason that I called you in here today is, uh, please don't hate me.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you like to have dinner sometime?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
ФИБИ: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree amp Evelyn?
ФИБИ: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
НЕДРУГ: What is this place?
НЕДРУГ: Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
НЕДРУГ: I think we have an answer.
НЕДРУГ: What's she doing here?
НЕДРУГ: This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
НЕДРУГ: Think she got fired at Riff's?
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept bringing swordfish. Are you gonna go.
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right.
НЕДРУГ: It looks like her. Um, excuse me.
ФИБИ: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, it's us.
ФИБИ: Right, and it's me.
НЕДРУГ: So, so you're here too?
ФИБИ: Much as you are.
НЕДРУГ: Your turn.
НЕДРУГ: We know what we want.
ФИБИ: Oh, that's good.
НЕДРУГ: All we want is two cafe lattes.
НЕДРУГ: And some biscotti cookies.
ФИБИ: Good choice.
НЕДРУГ: Definitely her.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
МОНИКА: Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.
МОНИКА: I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles.
НЕДРУГ: You're doing it again.
МОНИКА: We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly.
НЕДРУГ: I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don't even have cats.
НЕДРУГ: I could have cats.
МОНИКА: Goodbye Mr. Heckles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We'll try to keep it down.
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
ФИБИ: Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise.
ФИБИ: Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you seein' her again tonight?
ДЖОУИ: Yep. Ice Capades.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that.
ФИБИ: That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok.
ФИБИ: All right, well, maybe now it's not ok.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok.
ФИБИ: Ok.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that's the Chrysler building right there.
НЕДРУГ: Nina.
НЕДРУГ: Mr. Douglas. Cool tie.
НЕДРУГ: She's still here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Fl-, Dr Flanen, Dr. Flan, and uh, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding? She seems so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, no. Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
НЕДРУГ: That's unbelievable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others.
НЕДРУГ: I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
НЕДРУГ: Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our last class.
РОСС: Susan, go deep.
НЕДРУГ: This is impossible. It's just impossible.
НЕДРУГ: What is, honey?
НЕДРУГ: What that woman did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in. That's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in.
РОСС: Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right.
НЕДРУГ: What do you know? No one's come up to you and said, Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?
НЕДРУГ: Carol, Carol, please. Cleansing breath. I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives. I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
РОСС: I'm gonna be a father.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's just occurring to you?
РОСС: I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you're gonna be great!
РОСС: Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
ФИБИ: Where're you going?
ДЖОУИ: Out.
ФИБИ: With?
ДЖОУИ: Yes.
ФИБИ: All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know like, you know, you know, yet?
ДЖОУИ: Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right?
НЕДРУГ: Do you have a sec?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. For the past couple of days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're uh, jealous of us.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise.
НЕДРУГ: I am?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, why not?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god! You're amazing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you don't know. Helen, would you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?
НЕДРУГ: Do you still want me to send her psychological profile to personnel?
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I ended up telling her everything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, how'd she take it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk.
МОНИКА: Ok, I think I get how to do this.
ФИБИ: All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it-make them go away? I can't, I can't look.
МОНИКА: Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right?
ФИБИ: Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
ФИБИ: Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
НЕДРУГ: No.
ФИБИ: Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not gonna lose him.
МОНИКА: Come on, you gotta talk to Joey.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РОСС: Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
ФИБИ: But he's falling in love with her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious.
ФИБИ: Ok. Oh, ok, oh.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Yeah, um, may we help you?
МОНИКА: Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so I'm takin' 'em down. Ok? Whoa!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm ok! I'm ok! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
НЕДРУГ: See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
