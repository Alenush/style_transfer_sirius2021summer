РОСС: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
НЕДРУГ: Oooh! 
МОНИКА: W-wait. What is that? 
РОСС: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? 
МОНИКА: No, no, I don't. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? 
РОСС: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. 
ФИБИ: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass! 
МОНИКА: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment? 
РОСС: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so... 
МОНИКА: Why don't you just get a roommate? 
РОСС: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. 
ФИБИ: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Might wanna open with the snowman. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy. 
МОНИКА: So, how'd it go? 
ДЖОУИ: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job. 
РОСС: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. 
ДЖОУИ: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. 
МОНИКА: So what are you gonna be? 
ДЖОУИ: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, you wish! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, okay. Alright. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. 
НЕДРУГ: Woooo! Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, you're on. 
ФИБИ: Oh, oh, good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh! 
ФИБИ: Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. 
ФИБИ: 
ФИБИ: 
НЕДРУГ: No. No, that's- that's okay. 
ФИБИ: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That guy's going home with a note! 
НЕДРУГ: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my- 
ФИБИ: Could you speak up please? 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought 
НЕДРУГ: Daryl Hannah. 
НЕДРУГ: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a... 
НЕДРУГ: Hard quality. 
НЕДРУГ: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. 
ФИБИ: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! 
РОСС: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much? 
РОСС: Just a smidge. 
ФИБИ: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical. 
МОНИКА: I think it's romantic. 
ФИБИ: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact. 
ФИБИ: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
РОСС: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Nice shoes, huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aah, y'killing me! 
МОНИКА: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! 
РОСС: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right? 
МОНИКА: Do you always have to bring him here? 
РОСС: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. 
РОСС: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. 
НЕДРУГ: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. 
ФИБИ: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. 
НЕДРУГ: Yuh. 
ФИБИ: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you. 
ФИБИ: Sure. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. 
ФИБИ: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body. 
НЕДРУГ: Rrrreally. 
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. 
НЕДРУГ: ...Now? Now? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, right now. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift. 
ФИБИ: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop? 
ФИБИ: I can hop. 
РОСС: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you? 
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: You know more than one Fun Bobby? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I happen to know a Fun Bob. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, here we go... 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There. Now there is. 
РОСС: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, four. 
РОСС: Four. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Five. 
РОСС: Five. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? 
РОСС: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who. 
РОСС: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now. 
МОНИКА: What's the matter? 
РОСС: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. 
РОСС: Really. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. 
РОСС: What, uh... what juggling thing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that. 
РОСС: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon... 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe. Hi. 
ФИБИ: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? 
НЕДРУГ: No. Have you seen David? 
ФИБИ: No, no, he hasn't been around. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk. 
ФИБИ: Minsk? 
НЕДРУГ: Minsk. It's in Russia. 
ФИБИ: I know where Minsk is. 
НЕДРУГ: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. 
ФИБИ: So when, when do you leave? 
НЕДРУГ: January first. 
ФИБИ: Hello? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! What-what're you doing here? 
ФИБИ: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting! 
НЕДРУГ: It'd be even more exciting if we were going. 
ФИБИ: Oh, you're not going? Oh, why? 
НЕДРУГ: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you, Max. Thank you. 
ФИБИ: So-so you're really not going? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide. 
ФИБИ: Oh don't do that. 
НЕДРУГ: Please. 
ФИБИ: Oh no no. 
НЕДРУГ: No, but I'm asking- 
ФИБИ: Oh, but I can't do that- 
НЕДРУГ: No, but I can't- 
ФИБИ: It's your thing, and- 
НЕДРУГ: -make the decision- 
ФИБИ: Okay, um, stay. 
НЕДРУГ: Stay. 
ФИБИ: Stay. 
ФИБИ: Getting so good at that! 
НЕДРУГ: It was Max's stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You remember Janice. 
МОНИКА: Vividly. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I'm Sandy. 
ДЖОУИ: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. That's okay, right? 
РОСС: Par-tay! 
МОНИКА: That thing is not coming in here. 
РОСС: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home? 
МОНИКА: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table. 
РОСС: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... 
МОНИКА: Alright. Just keep him away from me. 
РОСС: Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. 
МОНИКА: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rome. Jerk missed his flight. 
ФИБИ: And then... your face is bloated? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip? 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, that's, uh, dirty. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, kids... 
РОСС: Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. 
НЕДРУГ: There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you found me! 
НЕДРУГ: Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kill me. Kill me now. 
МОНИКА: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? 
НЕДРУГ: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we- 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no. Oh, no. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry you misunderstood... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, will you give me the thing. 
ФИБИ: Hi, Max! 
НЕДРУГ: Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow. 
НЕДРУГ: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year. 
ФИБИ: Are you alright? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
ФИБИ: You're going to Minsk. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm... not going to Minsk. 
ФИБИ: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you. 
ФИБИ: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, ow. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll never forget you. 
ФИБИ: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square... 
ДЖОУИ: There y'go, kids. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight. 
ДЖОУИ: You seen Sandy? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The bll is drrbing! 
НЕДРУГ: In twenty seconds it'll be midnight... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the moment of joy is upon us. 
ДЖОУИ: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out. 
ФИБИ: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that. 
МОНИКА: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. 
ФИБИ: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't kiss anyone. 
МОНИКА: So I'm kissing everyone? 
ДЖОУИ: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother. 
РОСС: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me! 
ДЖОУИ: Alrightalrightalright. There. 
РОСС: I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
