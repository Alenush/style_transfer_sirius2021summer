НЕДРУГ: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got 100 advance in my salary?
НЕДРУГ: An advance?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
НЕДРУГ: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only 98.50 to go.
МОНИКА: Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
РОСС: No, they're not.
МОНИКА: Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
РОСС: You're wrong.
МОНИКА: I am not wrong.
РОСС: You're wrong.
МОНИКА: No, I just talked to them.
РОСС: I'm calling Mom.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
ФИБИ: What were you modeling for?
ДЖОУИ: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
МОНИКА: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys?
ФИБИ: You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you know which one you're gonna be?
ДЖОУИ: No, I hear lyme disease is open, so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks.
РОСС: Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
МОНИКА: Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
РОСС: Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
МОНИКА: You know, they're not actually supposed to have. I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, every single one of them.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
ФИБИ: Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
МОНИКА: So you're free Thursday, then.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Oh, can I come?
МОНИКА: Yeah. Rache, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought it was 98.50.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
РОСС: Well, I'm off to Carol's.
ФИБИ: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
РОСС: Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
РОСС: Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
НЕДРУГ: No, she's at a faculty meeting.
РОСС: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull, well, not mine, but. SUSAN: Come in.
РОСС: Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
НЕДРУГ: What's it look like?
РОСС: Kinda like a big face without skin.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
РОСС: Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
РОСС: Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
РОСС: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
НЕДРУГ: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
РОСС: You're not serious, I mean, you really, you really talk to it?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
РОСС: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, all the time.
РОСС: Really?
НЕДРУГ: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
РОСС: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
ФИБИ: Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally believe everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
МОНИКА: Hey, Rache, did you make your money?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
МОНИКА: Rache, here's your mail.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
МОНИКА: No, here's your mail.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
МОНИКА: Would you just open it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
МОНИКА: We all chipped in.
ДЖОУИ: We did?
МОНИКА: You owe me 20 bucks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Thank you so much!
МОНИКА: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I'm nine years old.
РОСС: Oh, I hate this story.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have, and I remember this part vividly, a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
НЕДРУГ: We did?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, right.
ДЖОУИ: I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
НЕДРУГ: Get out.
ДЖОУИ: I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
НЕДРУГ: Really? You don't know what that means to me.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
НЕДРУГ: Nothing.
ДЖОУИ: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Oh.
ДЖОУИ: What's wrong?
НЕДРУГ: I just remembered, I have to do something.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. What?
НЕДРУГ: Um, leave.
ДЖОУИ: Wait, wait, wait!
ДЖОУИ: So I guess you all saw it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Saw what?
ФИБИ: No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
ДЖОУИ: Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
МОНИКА: Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?
РОСС: I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
МОНИКА: All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
РОСС: That's closer.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you must stop shooping.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, will you just come in already?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
ФИБИ: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
МОНИКА: That's not a question.
ДЖОУИ: But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
МОНИКА: All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
РОСС: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
МОНИКА: Ah!
РОСС: Ok, Mom never hit.
ФИБИ: Ok, all done.
МОНИКА: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes-Ross needs lumps!
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
МОНИКА: Why would we do that?
ФИБИ: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
МОНИКА: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
ДЖОУИ: The balloon?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't, I gotta go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
ФИБИ: Almost never.
МОНИКА: Got the keys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: Anytime you're ready.
РОСС: Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but.
НЕДРУГ: Just aim for the bump.
РОСС: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
НЕДРУГ: So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
РОСС: Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
МОНИКА: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
МОНИКА: No I don't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you do. When we left, you said, got the keys.
МОНИКА: No I didn't. I asked, got the ke-eys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, you said, got the keys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do either of you have the keys?
МОНИКА: The oven is on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
ДЖОУИ: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
МОНИКА: Well then get it, get it!
ДЖОУИ: That tone will not make me go any faster.
МОНИКА: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: That one will.
РОСС: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
НЕДРУГ: Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
РОСС: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, how's it goin?
РОСС: Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
НЕДРУГ: I did.
РОСС: Does it always, uh-?
НЕДРУГ: No, no that was the first.
НЕДРУГ: Keep singing! Keep singing!
РОСС: Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
НЕДРУГ: I felt it!
РОСС: Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
ДЖОУИ: Nope, not that one.
МОНИКА: Can you go any faster with that?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
МОНИКА: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For an emergency just like this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not.
МОНИКА: I swear you said you had the keys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
ФИБИ: Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
МОНИКА: Why would I have the keys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
МОНИКА: But I didn't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you should have.
МОНИКА: Why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because!
МОНИКА: Why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because!
МОНИКА: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
МОНИКА: Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
РОСС: Here we come, walkin' down the-this doesn't smell like Mom's.
МОНИКА: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
МОНИКА: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
ДЖОУИ: You call that delicious?
МОНИКА: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
ФИБИ: Ooh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
ДЖОУИ: I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
МОНИКА: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
ФИБИ: It's nice that he has someone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shall I carve?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: By all means.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
РОСС: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
МОНИКА: Does anybody wanna split this with me?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I will.
ФИБИ: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
МОНИКА: Make a wish?
ФИБИ: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
ДЖОУИ: The bigger half.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
НЕДРУГ: That's so sweet.
РОСС: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And a crappy New Year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here, here!
