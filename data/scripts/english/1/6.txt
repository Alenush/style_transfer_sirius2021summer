РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom.
ФИБИ: The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
РОСС: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
ДЖОУИ: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God. I feel violated.
МОНИКА: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, ten o'clock.
РОСС: Is it? Feels like two.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, ten o'clock.
РОСС: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
РОСС: Oh. Hel-lo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
МОНИКА: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
РОСС: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you, buddy.
ФИБИ: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
МОНИКА: You could do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'think?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this. I'm very very aware of my tongue.
РОСС: C'mon! C'mon!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here goes.
НЕДРУГ: Yes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, um, okay, next word, would be. Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh, hi.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, you said that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh, would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
ДЖОУИ: Whadja think?
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
ДЖОУИ: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
НЕДРУГ: Saw your head. Saw your head.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She said yes! She said yes! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is it?
ДЖОУИ: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
ФИБИ: Based on this play?. Based on this play!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, kids.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is, just a line.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
МОНИКА: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was unbelievable. II've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army.
НЕДРУГ: Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I-. I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn, just for the hell of it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening, more or less.
НЕДРУГ: All of a sudden we realised we were in Yemen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
НЕДРУГ: 'We' would be me and Rick.
ДЖОУИ: Who's Rick?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who's Rick?
НЕДРУГ: My husband.
НЕДРУГ: Ooooohhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so you're divorced?
НЕДРУГ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?. Hopefully?
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm still married.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So tell me, how do how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?. Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
НЕДРУГ: Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
НЕДРУГ: Mmmm. Ethan is my, boyfriend.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
НЕДРУГ: I suppose mainly sexual.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hm.
МОНИКА: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
МОНИКА: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
РОСС: No, of course not! Yeah, yeah, it is.
МОНИКА: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
ДЖОУИ: I couldn't do it.
МОНИКА: Good for you, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
РОСС: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking.
РОСС: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
МОНИКА: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! C'mon!
РОСС: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tah-daaah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors. I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
РОСС: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, whaddya think?
НЕДРУГ: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
МОНИКА: Oh! II see you moved the green ottoman.
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh.
МОНИКА: How-how did that happen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dunno. II thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
МОНИКА: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting, but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
ФИБИ: I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
МОНИКА: You guys, I am not that bad!
ФИБИ: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
МОНИКА: That is so unfair!
РОСС: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
МОНИКА: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
РОСС: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
МОНИКА: Why not?
РОСС: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
МОНИКА: I could do that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
МОНИКА: Why would someone do that?! One might wonder.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood.
МОНИКА: STOP IT! Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
РОСС: Monica? You're Mom.
ФИБИ: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
ДЖОУИ: Uh huh, uh huh, oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Whoah!
МОНИКА: Well, what's the part?
ДЖОУИ: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!'
ФИБИ: Seriously, what-what's the part?
ДЖОУИ: 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!'
РОСС: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
ДЖОУИ: I'm his.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
ДЖОУИ: I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.
МОНИКА: Oh my God.
ДЖОУИ: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, it's terrific, it's it's y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
РОСС: You're right, you're right, it is. So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
МОНИКА: Alright, alright, alright.
ДЖОУИ: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
МОНИКА: For what?
ДЖОУИ: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
МОНИКА: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
МОНИКА: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes! My eyes!
МОНИКА: I warned you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who is being loud?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
МОНИКА: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every single second is like that with Aurora, and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh. Monica, can you help me with the door?
МОНИКА: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush. But I'm not gonna do that.
НЕДРУГ: Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
НЕДРУГ: Lose the robe.
ДЖОУИ: Me?
НЕДРУГ: That would work.
ДЖОУИ: Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it, water's working, and, action.
НЕДРУГ: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm I'm showering.
НЕДРУГ: No, that was clenching.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing. I think his butt would be angry here.
НЕДРУГ: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling, water working, and action. and cut. What was that?
ДЖОУИ: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God, I love these fingers.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I'm late.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't go.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Oh no, I have to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Too bad, she's leaving.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I thought I thought you talked to Rick.
НЕДРУГ: It's not Rick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
НЕДРУГ: No, it's-it's Andrew.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but And Andrew is?
НЕДРУГ: He's, new.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
НЕДРУГ: No, that's not exactly what I was.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
НЕДРУГ: So what do you want?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You.
НЕДРУГ: You have me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nono, just you.
НЕДРУГ: Whaddyou mean?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lose the other guys.
НЕДРУГ: Like, all of them?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: C'mon, we're great together, why not?
НЕДРУГ: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another, and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device. And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
НЕДРУГ: So, which one of the two guys will you listen to?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, II have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish.
НЕДРУГ: Which one?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The second guy.
НЕДРУГ: Well, call me if you change your mind.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
РОСС: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable. Tell me why you did this again?
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
ДЖОУИ: Nope.
РОСС: No? What happened, big guy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'Big guy'?
РОСС: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
ДЖОУИ: I got fired.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
ДЖОУИ: My mom will.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Something so sweet and, disturbing about that.
ДЖОУИ: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
МОНИКА: Maybe this wasn't your shot.
РОСС: Yeah, I mean I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it feel like your shot?
ДЖОУИ: Hard to tell, I was naked.
ФИБИ: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? That's so nice!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
НЕДРУГ: Night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
МОНИКА: Uh-huh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
МОНИКА: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
РОСС: She is a kook.
МОНИКА: If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them. But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! I need help!
