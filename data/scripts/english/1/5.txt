НЕДРУГ: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
РОСС: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
НЕДРУГ: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
НЕДРУГ: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
РОСС: Multiple orgasms!
НЕДРУГ: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
ДЖОУИ: No plans, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Not a one.
РОСС: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, right, right, shut up.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
НЕДРУГ: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
ДЖОУИ: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
НЕДРУГ: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
НЕДРУГ: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.  ROSS: Tony?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
НЕДРУГ: Does anybody want anything else?
РОСС: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
НЕДРУГ: What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
НЕДРУГ: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
РОСС: That guy, he burns me up.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
НЕДРУГ: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: My god, Angela.
НЕДРУГ: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
НЕДРУГ: Are you gonna go over there?
ДЖОУИ: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
НЕДРУГ: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: You look good.
НЕДРУГ: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
ДЖОУИ: You don't say.
РОСС: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at laundorama.
РОСС: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
НЕДРУГ: Who?
РОСС: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
НЕДРУГ: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
РОСС: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
НЕДРУГ: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
ДЖОУИ: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
НЕДРУГ: Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob--
ДЖОУИ: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: We're just friends.
ДЖОУИ: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
НЕДРУГ: What four of us?
ДЖОУИ: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
ДЖОУИ: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
НЕДРУГ: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
ДЖОУИ: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is--
НЕДРУГ: Oh, god help us.
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
ДЖОУИ: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
НЕДРУГ: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
ДЖОУИ: I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
РОСС: Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
РОСС: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
НЕДРУГ: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
РОСС: Nuh-uh.
НЕДРУГ: Yuh-huh.
РОСС: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear--do you want it to be dirty?
РОСС: No.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
РОСС: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
НЕДРУГ: There you go.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
ДЖОУИ: Yep.
НЕДРУГ: Which?
ДЖОУИ: Which what?
НЕДРУГ: You've never met Bob, have you?
ДЖОУИ: No, but he's--
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly--
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Joey.
НЕДРУГ: --horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
НЕДРУГ: Where are they? Where are they?
НЕДРУГ: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
НЕДРУГ: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
НЕДРУГ: Eww, I don't wanna do that.
НЕДРУГ: Here we go.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, have a good break-up.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Janice.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
НЕДРУГ: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: What... did you get me there?
НЕДРУГ: I got you--these.
НЕДРУГ: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
НЕДРУГ: That's great.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
НЕДРУГ: No, no, I'm still working on mine.
НЕДРУГ: That's it?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it was really hard.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, you weren't there.
НЕДРУГ: Comin' through. Move, move.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
НЕДРУГ: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: No suds, no save. Ok?
РОСС: What's goin' on?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
РОСС: Was your basket on top?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but, there were no suds.
РОСС: So?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, no suds, no save.
РОСС: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
РОСС: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
РОСС: All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
НЕДРУГ: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
РОСС: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
НЕДРУГ: What's that?
РОСС: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
РОСС: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
НЕДРУГ: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
РОСС: Rach, have you never done this before?
НЕДРУГ: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
РОСС: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
РОСС: Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
НЕДРУГ: He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
НЕДРУГ: Brooklyn Heights.
НЕДРУГ: Cleveland.
НЕДРУГ: How, how did that happen?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my god.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ДЖОУИ: I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
ДЖОУИ: So, you and Angela, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yep. Pretty much.
ДЖОУИ: You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
НЕДРУГ: Huh, I never really noticed.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
НЕДРУГ: Monica, Monica is great.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
НЕДРУГ: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, isn't he?
НЕДРУГ: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
НЕДРУГ: You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
НЕДРУГ: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
НЕДРУГ: Huh. That's nice.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
НЕДРУГ: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
НЕДРУГ: All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
РОСС: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
НЕДРУГ: What uh-oh?
РОСС: Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, what's the matter?
РОСС: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
НЕДРУГ: Come on, show me.
РОСС: All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, everything's pink.
РОСС: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
НЕДРУГ: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
НЕДРУГ: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god.
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, they're close.
НЕДРУГ: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's--not really true, is it?
ДЖОУИ: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god, what were you thinking?
ДЖОУИ: All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: Ow!
НЕДРУГ: I'm outta here.
ДЖОУИ: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
НЕДРУГ: I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
НЕДРУГ: Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
НЕДРУГ: Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
НЕДРУГ: Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
НЕДРУГ: I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I don't know, a million?
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
НЕДРУГ: I'm fine.
НЕДРУГ: All right.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not fine. Here she comes.
НЕДРУГ: Wait here. Breathe.
НЕДРУГ: How do you do that?
НЕДРУГ: It's like a gift.
НЕДРУГ: We should always always break up together.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'd like that.
РОСС: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
НЕДРУГ: Let go!
НЕДРУГ: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Did you see that?
РОСС: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
НЕДРУГ: I could not have done this without you.
РОСС: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
НЕДРУГ: Are you sure?
РОСС: No.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, are you sure you're ok?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Does it still hurt?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, how'd it go?
ДЖОУИ: Excellent.
НЕДРУГ: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
РОСС: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Where's Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
НЕДРУГ: I'm free! I'm free!
