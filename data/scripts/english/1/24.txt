РОСС: And here's little Ben nodding off... 
НЕДРУГ: Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over! 
РОСС: That would be nice. 
НЕДРУГ: Pardon? 
НЕДРУГ: Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah right, OK, including the waffles last week, you now owe me...seventeen jillion dollars. 
ДЖОУИ: I will, really. I'll pay you back this time. 
НЕДРУГ: ... And where's this money coming from? 
ДЖОУИ: Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research. 
РОСС: What kind of research? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, just, y'know.... science. 
РОСС: Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. 
ДЖОУИ: ... It's a fertility study. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. 
РОСС: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist! 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, we got the plates, we got the buns... 
НЕДРУГ: We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... 
НЕДРУГ: Men are here. 
ДЖОУИ: We make fire. Cook meat. 
НЕДРУГ: Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. 
НЕДРУГ: Ewww! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, OK. 
НЕДРУГ: So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? What does she think of your little science project? 
ДЖОУИ: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? 
НЕДРУГ: Man's got a point. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. 
НЕДРУГ: Crazy bitch. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey... we always know what you mean. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last? 
РОСС: I'm going to China. 
НЕДРУГ: Jeez, you say one thing, and... 
НЕДРУГ: You're going to China? 
РОСС: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's-- it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, let me see! 
РОСС: : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun. 
РОСС: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. 
РОСС: Oh. Hey, who's Carl? 
НЕДРУГ: You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. 
РОСС: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the-- 
РОСС: At the coffeehouse, right. 
НЕДРУГ: So you do know who he is! Sorry. 
РОСС: OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. 
РОСС: Hi. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РОСС: ....I have to go to China. 
ДЖОУИ: The country? 
РОСС: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no. 
РОСС: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? 
НЕДРУГ: Forget about her. 
ДЖОУИ: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. 
НЕДРУГ: Course there, they just call it food. 
РОСС: Yeah... I guess. I don't--I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. 
РОСС: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. 
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.' 
ДЖОУИ: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. 
НЕДРУГ: Ooooh. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, how does everybody like their burgers? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I-- 
ДЖОУИ: Then you do. Heh, heh. 
НЕДРУГ: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her? 
ДЖОУИ: What do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, just be there for her. 
ДЖОУИ: Not following you. 
НЕДРУГ: Think about it. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, I'm guessing this is from... 
НЕДРУГ: Well, thank you, Melanie. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, this one right here is from me. 
НЕДРУГ: OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! 
НЕДРУГ: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss! 
ДЖОУИ: : That book got me through some tough times. 
НЕДРУГ: There is a little child inside this man! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. 
НЕДРУГ: Who's this from? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's Ross's. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered. 
НЕДРУГ: Remembered what? 
НЕДРУГ: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. 
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe he did this. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? 
НЕДРУГ: What did you just say? 
НЕДРУГ: ahem... um... Crystal duck. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part? 
НЕДРУГ: F-hah.... flennin.... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh.... my God. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no no no no no.... 
ДЖОУИ: That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, this is unbelievable. 
НЕДРУГ: I know. This is really, really huge. 
НЕДРУГ: No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. 
НЕДРУГ: Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again. 
НЕДРУГ: OK, is there a mute button on this woman? 
НЕДРУГ: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea? 
НЕДРУГ: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. 
НЕДРУГ: H-He's in China! 
ДЖОУИ: The country. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes. 
НЕДРУГ: What about the time difference? 
НЕДРУГ: From here to the airport? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! You're never gonna make it! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him? 
НЕДРУГ: I-I-I don't know. 
НЕДРУГ: Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
ДЖОУИ: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him. 
НЕДРУГ: Here, look, alright, does this help? 
НЕДРУГ: Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! 
РОСС: 
НЕДРУГ: Alright! 
РОСС: Ni-chou chi-ma! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: May I see your boarding pass? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I know, but I--he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just... 
НЕДРУГ: No no no! Federal regulations! 
НЕДРУГ: OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright. What's the message? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh... I don't know. 
НЕДРУГ: Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back. 
НЕДРУГ: : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze. 
НЕДРУГ: Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute! 
ДЖОУИ: Heh, heh. It was nothin'. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! 
ДЖОУИ: Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn. 
НЕДРУГ: M-Me again? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure! Why not? 
НЕДРУГ: Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow. 
НЕДРУГ: Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be. 
ДЖОУИ: How do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. 
НЕДРУГ: Another good point. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed. 
НЕДРУГ: Huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out? 
НЕДРУГ: Why isn't it working out? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know... sometimes it doesn't. 
НЕДРУГ: Is he not cute enough for you? 
НЕДРУГ: No! 
НЕДРУГ: Does he not make enough money? 
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm just.... 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe there's someone else. 
НЕДРУГ: Wha-- 
НЕДРУГ: Is there? Is there someone else? 
НЕДРУГ: No! There is.. there is noone else! 
НЕДРУГ: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, big-- 
ДЖОУИ: Shhhh! 
НЕДРУГ: --spender. 
ДЖОУИ: She's still asleep. 
НЕДРУГ: So how'd it go? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? 
НЕДРУГ: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. 
ДЖОУИ: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. 
НЕДРУГ: I didn't know you had another level. 
ДЖОУИ: I know! Neither did I! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, from who? 
НЕДРУГ: From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this--this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, why? 
НЕДРУГ: Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna-- 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! 
НЕДРУГ: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... 
НЕДРУГ: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise. 
НЕДРУГ: Who is it? 
НЕДРУГ: It's me, Carl. 
НЕДРУГ: C'mon up. 
НЕДРУГ: Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. 
ДЖОУИ: Seven hundred bucks! 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? 
ДЖОУИ: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? 
ДЖОУИ: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! 
РОСС: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. 
НЕДРУГ: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. 
РОСС: Fine, just stop thinking about me. 
РОСС: Can't do it, can you? 
НЕДРУГ: So I'm thinking about you. So what? 
РОСС: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway? 
НЕДРУГ: Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy.... 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! 
РОСС: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, it's too hard. 
РОСС: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, you're like my best friend. 
РОСС: I know. 
НЕДРУГ: If we broke up, and I lost you... 
РОСС: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? 
РОСС: No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. 
РОСС: Well, start looking. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow. 
НЕДРУГ: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! 
НЕДРУГ: Right! You're right! 
НЕДРУГ: Heh... y'know? 
НЕДРУГ: You know what? 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I mean--I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: But... 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! 
РОСС: Oh, hey, hey, I got that. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks, sweetie. 
РОСС: No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? 
РОСС: No, no, they will. I just... uh... 
НЕДРУГ: Can't wait. 
РОСС: Come on, they're gonna love you.
