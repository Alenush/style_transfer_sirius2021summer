НЕДРУГ: Ohhh, man!! 
ДЖОУИ: What is that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Treeger’s snaking the shower drain. 
НЕДРУГ: What in the name of hell? 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe he found you flip-flop. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do we pay for this? 
ДЖОУИ: No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill maybe this is how they punish us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill free phone sex. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like finding money with naked people on it! 
НЕДРУГ: Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I’m sad. 
ДЖОУИ: Why would he turn off the TV? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no-no! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don’t know what could make this go away. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And no one touches the air around the TV! 
ДЖОУИ: Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay? 
МОНИКА: Well at least, I’m going to mute it. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We still have porn. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Give it here. Oh, God. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table. 
ФИБИ: You mean like a doctor? 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out! 
ФИБИ: Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today. 
РОСС: Hi. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
РОСС: So uh, Emily just went to the airport. 
МОНИКА: Oh. Why didn’t you take her? 
РОСС: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so...... 
МОНИКА: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn! 
РОСС: Nah. 
МОНИКА: Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right? 
РОСС: Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy!" 
МОНИКА: No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again. 
РОСС: And why do you care so much? 
МОНИКА: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy! 
РОСС: You had fantasies about Emily? 
МОНИКА: No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together. 
РОСС: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid? 
МОНИКА: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything! 
РОСС: Ahh. 
МОНИКА: Do you love her? 
РОСС: We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know? 
МОНИКА: You love her! 
РОСС: What-what is love really? 
МОНИКА: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she’s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud. 
РОСС: I am a good kisser. 
МОНИКА: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I’ve been watching too much porn. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is that the heartbeat? 
НЕДРУГ: That’s it. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow! This is so cool. 
НЕДРУГ: Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births? 
ФИБИ: Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay? 
НЕДРУГ: No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats. 
ФИБИ: Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one! 
НЕДРУГ: Doctors are wrong all the time. 
ФИБИ: Well, yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?! 
НЕДРУГ: Definitely. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out! 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one. 
ФИБИ: What do you know?! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh-oh, Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Ooh! Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors? 
ФИБИ: Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that’s nice?" 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. 
ФИБИ: Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies. 
НЕДРУГ: Three babies? 
НЕДРУГ: I finally got my band! 
НЕДРУГ: We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family! 
ФИБИ: Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked. 
НЕДРУГ: Why would we be freaked? 
ФИБИ: No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and.... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. 
ФИБИ: No, back to happy. Back to happy! 
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job. 
НЕДРУГ: No, Frank. 
ФИБИ: No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, refrigerator college. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career and I love refrigerators! 
ФИБИ: You can’t give up on your dream. 
НЕДРУГ: No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re gonna have three kids! And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money. 
НЕДРУГ: This is the boarding call for Flight 009. 
РОСС: Emily! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! What are you doing here? 
РОСС: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off. 
НЕДРУГ: You are so sweet. 
РОСС: That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you. 
НЕДРУГ: Me too. 
НЕДРУГ: This is the final boarding call for Flight 009. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, that’ me. Here, have this. I’m only allowed one piece of carry on anyway. 
РОСС: Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Thank you. 
РОСС: That’s no problem. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s the theme from Good Will Humping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, he likes porn. 
МОНИКА: Where ya going? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: How did it go with Frank and Alice? 
ФИБИ: Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though. 
МОНИКА: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her? 
РОСС: I did. 
МОНИКА: And well, what did she say? 
РОСС: Thank you. 
МОНИКА: Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say? 
РОСС: She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?! 
РОСС: What do I do now? 
ДЖОУИ: You play hard to get. 
РОСС: She already lives in London. 
ДЖОУИ: Then you go to Tokyo. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over. 
МОНИКА: It is not over! You’re over! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: You know! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Good one. 
МОНИКА: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! 
РОСС: Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over. 
ДЖОУИ: Way to be strong, man! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In &amp; Out &amp; In, Again. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay. 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what-what ‘cha got there? 
ФИБИ: Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pregnant Woman Slays Four? 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they? 
ФИБИ: No! 
МОНИКА: Are you sure? 
ФИБИ: No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives. 
ФИБИ: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s the second part of your plan? 
ФИБИ: My Saturn dealership. 
РОСС: Hello? 
НЕДРУГ: Ross. 
РОСС: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight? 
НЕДРУГ: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. 
РОСС: No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else. 
РОСС: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America? 
РОСС: She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy. 
МОНИКА: This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy. 
РОСС: Well..? 
МОНИКА: Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love! 
РОСС: I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You put your fist through the wall? 
РОСС: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard! 
МОНИКА: You have to go to London! 
РОСС: What? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, you have to go fight for her! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her! 
МОНИКА: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do? 
РОСС: I made fun of his accent. 
МОНИКА: You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily? 
РОСС: No. 
МОНИКА: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London! 
РОСС: Really? 
МОНИКА: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight! 
РОСС: All right. All right, I’m gonna do it! 
МОНИКА: All right. 
РОСС: I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her. 
МОНИКА: Okay, good luck! 
ДЖОУИ: Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school! 
МОНИКА: That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised... 
ФИБИ: I’m telling it! I’m telling it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A place where no one will ever get out alive? 
ФИБИ: No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Relaxi-Taxi! 
ФИБИ: The name was my favourite part! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, well I came up with it! 
ФИБИ: YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I... 
МОНИКА: Hello. 
РОСС: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised? 
РОСС: No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment! 
МОНИКА: All right. When is, when is the next flight out? 
РОСС: About four hours. 
МОНИКА: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home. 
ФИБИ: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab. 
ФИБИ: Oh, that is better. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are we in London? 
МОНИКА: What are you doing here? You can’t be here! 
НЕДРУГ: I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Nothing. No, nothing. 
НЕДРУГ: I was going to call him, but.. 
МОНИКА: Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I’m right, right? 
НЕДРУГ: I’d really rather talk to him. 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is? 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but, I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you. Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you. 
РОСС: I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can’t hear me. 
НЕДРУГ: I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello. 
РОСС: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, I love you! 
РОСС: Ohh! Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault. 
ДЖОУИ: Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?" 
ДЖОУИ: Noo! Nothing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn. 
ДЖОУИ: I think you’re right. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, ready? 
ДЖОУИ: One. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Two. 
НЕДРУГ: Three. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s kinda nice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that’s kinda a relief. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna see if we still have it? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: FREE PORN!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have free porn here!!!
