ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
РОСС: People can hear you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: That is one good looking man!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
НЕДРУГ: Sooo, you've been doing this long?
НЕДРУГ: No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice.
РОСС: Dude!
НЕДРУГ: Is that an expensive blouse?
НЕДРУГ: If you want it to be.
РОСС: Here's your girlfriend's button.
ФИБИ: Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
ФИБИ: Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
МОНИКА: Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just, throw your purses at it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
ФИБИ: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: That sounds great!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
ДЖОУИ: There's gravy?
МОНИКА: If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
МОНИКА: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: I think I left a donut up here.
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
РОСС: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me 32 to see it!
ФИБИ: That's a good idea for a business!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester? And she'll go, No-no-no, it's Chandler. And he'll go, Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
ДЖОУИ: That-that is a good trick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
РОСС: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
ДЖОУИ: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
РОСС: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
РОСС: They're not a couple!
ФИБИ: Oh-okay, I get the game now.
ДЖОУИ: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
РОСС: Oh yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
РОСС: No.
ДЖОУИ: Noooo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
РОСС: Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know but.
РОСС: Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
МОНИКА: You made pancakes?
ДЖОУИ: Yep! Grab a plate.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
ДЖОУИ: Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
РОСС: Oh yeah!
МОНИКА: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, who's playing?
МОНИКА: The players.
РОСС: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
МОНИКА: Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
ДЖОУИ: All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
ФИБИ: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
НЕДРУГ: In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I'm Joshua.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife,
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm so sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, at least that's a great suit.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way.
НЕДРУГ: It's this way? Sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
РОСС: All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
РОСС: Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be, y'know you.
НЕДРУГ: Hey you guys!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
РОСС: Oh, absolutely!
НЕДРУГ: Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
НЕДРУГ: It's a good play, isn't it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
РОСС: Okay, I.
НЕДРУГ: Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, II could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
НЕДРУГ: Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'mI'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you can understand, given how we started.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
НЕДРУГ: I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
ФИБИ: Rachel has a new doll.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
РОСС: Uh, hello!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi-e!
ФИБИ: Ooh, what do I smell?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, it smells good.
МОНИКА: Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
ФИБИ: Ooh!
МОНИКА: Please, have some!
РОСС: Oh, yumm!
МОНИКА: Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! The new Playboy!
МОНИКА: Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
РОСС: Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!
ФИБИ: What? What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
РОСС: Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's Joshua.
РОСС: Oh, whatever.
МОНИКА: Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
ФИБИ: Well, I hate to eat and run, but.
МОНИКА: No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I don't need it.
МОНИКА: People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
МОНИКА: I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, II served the best air.
ФИБИ: Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
МОНИКА: 'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'mI'm done now. They've suffered enough.
ФИБИ: If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, that's true.
МОНИКА: All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
ФИБИ: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: So you were right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!
РОСС: Chandler!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, what did she say?
ФИБИ: Wait a minute.
ДЖОУИ: Come here.
МОНИКА: Are you sure?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Beefsteak Charlie's?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! See you and I have always been like,
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
МОНИКА: Nah, I got it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
ФИБИ: Why don't you ask him out?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
ФИБИ: He just got a divorce right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm-mmm.
ФИБИ: So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
ФИБИ: You've never asked a guy out?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Have you?
ФИБИ: Thousands of times! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't even know how I would go about it.
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, Hey, how you doin'?
ФИБИ: Oh, please!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how you doin'?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we, the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?
ФИБИ: I've never done that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
ДЖОУИ: Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! You think that will work?
ДЖОУИ: Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
ДЖОУИ: What the heck is that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she call?
ФИБИ: No, sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, maybe I should call her.
ДЖОУИ: No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
РОСС: He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
РОСС: How might you be wrong?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
ДЖОУИ: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
РОСС: That's all you're basing this on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too, Umm, who likes the Knicks.
НЕДРУГ: What do you think?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
НЕДРУГ: Huh. Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?
НЕДРУГ: I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great.
НЕДРУГ: All right, thank you so much for all your help.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah-eah-ha!
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
НЕДРУГ: Ah, that's okay, thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Basketball!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! That would be great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: Good morning.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know, II wish I had too, but y'know II think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me, Nick's pants?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, for next time, what do you say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
РОСС: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
МОНИКА: Okay, it's ready. Come on.
ДЖОУИ: What's ready?
МОНИКА: Just come.
РОСС: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Monica!
ФИБИ: Great!
РОСС: This is beautiful!
ФИБИ: Oh did you, what did you, did you work for two days straight?
МОНИКА: Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, it looks the same.
МОНИКА: You used to have carpet.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah!
МОНИКА: So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
РОСС: Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
МОНИКА: Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: How'd it go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
ФИБИ: Oh good!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She is now.
РОСС: What are you saying?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm saying that she is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
ФИБИ: How? How is your fault?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because, II should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
РОСС: Well, if-if she thought they were on a break!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Will you call him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
