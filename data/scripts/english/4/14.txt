ФИБИ: So now, what is this now?
ДЖОУИ: Guggly worm.
ФИБИ: And this?
ДЖОУИ: Glow-pop giggly jammer.
ФИБИ: You make it so funny.
МОНИКА: Hey umm, what's this?
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
РОСС: Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and Someone knocked over a lamp.
ДЖОУИ: That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, Joey, what are you doing with your life? stuff. I can say, Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?
НЕДРУГ: Great!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you.
МОНИКА: Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
ДЖОУИ: Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
МОНИКА: What's Phase Two?
ДЖОУИ: Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How does going to a strip club help him better?
РОСС: Because there are naked ladies there.
ДЖОУИ: Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
РОСС: There are naked ladies there too.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you give me one minute! Please.
НЕДРУГ: So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! You know what I need?

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh, right.
НЕДРУГ: I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
РОСС: Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take 'em off and we'll have some fun.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey!
РОСС: Hi!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Catch any big fish?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! God! Wow!
МОНИКА: You stink!
РОСС: Are you kidding?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
РОСС: He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
ДЖОУИ: Hey buddy! How's it going?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Monica!
МОНИКА: Uh-oh, what's the matter?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So. What are you gonna do?
МОНИКА: I don't know sweetie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Help me!
МОНИКА: I can't! I have to work!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh!
ФИБИ: Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is, I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
МОНИКА: No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Hi!
РОСС: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So.
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhh, come on!
МОНИКА: I think she's here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
РОСС: You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
МОНИКА: Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!
НЕДРУГ: Hello!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
РОСС: All right, I'll do it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?
НЕДРУГ: Yes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm Rachel Green.
НЕДРУГ: Thank goodness.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So,
НЕДРУГ: Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, no I,
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
МОНИКА: III think you look great.
НЕДРУГ: Good night, it was very nice to meet you all.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'll get her.
РОСС: Please hurry.
ФИБИ: Don't you just love the way they talk?!
ФИБИ: Ohh!
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
МОНИКА: Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
ДЖОУИ: Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
МОНИКА: Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!
МОНИКА: So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
ФИБИ: Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep! and he let her right in.
МОНИКА: So you hit her in the face?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
ФИБИ: Aww, Pheebs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, that's you're name.
ФИБИ: That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
МОНИКА: Hey! You're wearing pants!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
МОНИКА: It's 9:30 in the morning!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They got a breakfast buffet.
МОНИКА: Hello. Oh, hey Ross!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, let me talk to him!
МОНИКА: Oh-oh, my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, can I just.
МОНИКА: Shh! Wait, what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
ФИБИ: Shhh! Please! What's he saying?
МОНИКА: He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
ФИБИ: What? Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Who the hell is Emily, noooo!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They're in Vermont! How could this happen?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How, how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
РОСС: When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
НЕДРУГ: Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
РОСС: I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
МОНИКА: He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't get this! She was horrible!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I'm going to go stand over there.
МОНИКА: Why do you care so much anyway?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
МОНИКА: Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every, little, thing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
МОНИКА: A couple of days.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
МОНИКА: What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
ФИБИ: Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
МОНИКА: Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No you can't.
ФИБИ: Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
ФИБИ: Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
НЕДРУГ: Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
ДЖОУИ: Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with,
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
НЕДРУГ: You.
ДЖОУИ: Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
НЕДРУГ: You?
ДЖОУИ: No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
НЕДРУГ: There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
ДЖОУИ: Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
НЕДРУГ: The one with Heston on it.
ДЖОУИ: Interesting.
МОНИКА: Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No thanks, Mom!
ФИБИ: Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant.
НЕДРУГ: Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
ФИБИ: Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
МОНИКА: Very good, so good.
ФИБИ: I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
ФИБИ: Come on! Look where you are!
МОНИКА: When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
ФИБИ: Remember, a virgin for me please.
МОНИКА: Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, come on! Y'know what, y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
ФИБИ: Well, if you think it will help.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice.
ФИБИ: You should! How is she?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhh!
МОНИКА: I think somebody needs another lap dance.
НЕДРУГ: Hello! Who's in there?
ДЖОУИ: How ya doin'?
НЕДРУГ: Who in the hell are you?
ДЖОУИ: I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
НЕДРУГ: You're in this picture?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause your a loose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
НЕДРУГ: Joey, right?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Every actor at one time or another opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no-no, you don't understand!
НЕДРУГ: Listen to me!
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, God, I stink! Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
ДЖОУИ: Yes sir! Yes sir, I'mI'm,
НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute! Take your pants.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
МОНИКА: So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
ФИБИ: Who, Josh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's Joshua.
МОНИКА: What, he doesn't like Josh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I don't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
ФИБИ: Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
ФИБИ: And do you know what girls are really good at?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stripping!
ФИБИ: No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?
МОНИКА: Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
МОНИКА: Come on! Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
МОНИКА: They really were pretty, weren't they?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
МОНИКА: Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
ФИБИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
МОНИКА: Oh, Chantal!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
МОНИКА: Really?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am totally picturing you with all those women!
МОНИКА: That's-that's not Phase Three.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm there too!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
ФИБИ: Oh! What is that? What is that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, let me see that smile.
ДЖОУИ: I don't wanna.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please?
ДЖОУИ: I wanted to go to the strip club!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, all right.
МОНИКА: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey, ooh so, how was Vermont?
РОСС: Emily is incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hey!
РОСС: Hey! You were so right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hmm.
РОСС: I mean, I, II admit II wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joshua.

РОСС: Happy for you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, happy for you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!
ФИБИ: II wanna be with her, I like her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
МОНИКА: Wait, now, what am I doing again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
