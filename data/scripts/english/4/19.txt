НЕДРУГ: Morning’s here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here! The morning’s here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: HEY! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
НЕДРУГ: Oh come on! Morning’s here! Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning’s here! Morning is here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
МОНИКА: Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
МОНИКА: Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, II worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: See, this is a great apartment.
МОНИКА: Shut up! This place is a hole!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, blimey, I still can’t believe you’ve got an earring!
РОСС: Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowie?
НЕДРУГ: He does that?!
РОСС: Uh, I don’t know, whatever.
НЕДРУГ: I think it makes you look really dangerous.
РОСС: Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’mI’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! II love that guy!
НЕДРУГ: I love both of you!
РОСС: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: I wish I didn’t have to go.
РОСС: Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, Ross, please!
РОСС: One more day, seriously.
НЕДРУГ: Don’t do this to me, again. You’d know I’d stay here in a minute, but I’d really miss so much work, they’ll fire me.
РОСС: So, then you can stay as long as you want.
НЕДРУГ: I wish I could.
РОСС: Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on!
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think you understand packing. Look, I just don’t want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
РОСС: Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
НЕДРУГ: You didn’t!
РОСС: No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
ФИБИ: Hello!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ho! Ho! Ho!
ФИБИ: Excuse me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your pants!
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
ФИБИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Santa pants. Santa Claus’s pants.
ФИБИ: Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So. Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
ФИБИ: I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know. You’re clothes aren’t funny.
МОНИКА: Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, a T-shirt that says, I don’t belong here.
ДЖОУИ: You have Knicks tickets?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
МОНИКА: Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you guys want these?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah we do!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, well you got ‘em.
НЕДРУГ: All right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just give us our apartment back!
ФИБИ: Boy! I didn’t see that coming!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
МОНИКА: Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?
ДЖОУИ: You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.
МОНИКА: What do you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re bachelor pad?!
МОНИКА: Have you even had a girl up here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you do!
ДЖОУИ: Come on!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
НЕДРУГ: Good one.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Oh come on, look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
РОСС: Hey, guys!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: We don’t make enough fun of you already?
РОСС: Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do know that Wham broke up?
РОСС: I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
ДЖОУИ: Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where is Emily?
РОСС: Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, didn’t she like just get here?
РОСС: Yeah! Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Easy tiger.
РОСС: I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what are you going to do?
РОСС: Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: I could ask her to live with me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious?
РОСС: I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
РОСС: Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean III love her, y’know?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna have some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
ДЖОУИ: All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!
РОСС: I don’t want to do that.
ДЖОУИ: No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!
РОСС: Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
ФИБИ: That’s too hard. Too hard!
МОНИКА: All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No thank you.
ДЖОУИ: Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
ДЖОУИ: It’s the Knicks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Screw the Knicks!
ДЖОУИ: Whoa!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
ДЖОУИ: Huh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the Knicks rule all.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
ФИБИ: Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
ДЖОУИ: Done!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let me finish.
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
ФИБИ: Or you could end up with everything.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, I like that.
МОНИКА: All right, so what do you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
МОНИКА: Oh, just do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Op, op, I’m convinced!
ДЖОУИ: Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.
ДЖОУИ: All right!
ФИБИ: Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.
ФИБИ: Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh, oh, I have a game!
ДЖОУИ: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
ФИБИ: This is great!
ДЖОУИ: What’s the game?! What’s the game?!
ФИБИ: Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name, oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
МОНИКА: They’re green?
ФИБИ: Good! Good! Five points!
ФИБИ: All right, Joey, same question.
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, they’re tall.
ФИБИ: Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
МОНИКА: That’s not even a game!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Shut up! We’re winning!
МОНИКА: You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine, let’s do it.
ФИБИ: Oh, I have cards!
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Oh, good.
ФИБИ: Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Okay. Four.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s a low one!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can’t.
ФИБИ: What make you think I can?!
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Okay. Ace!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why are you screaming and hugging?
МОНИКА: Because we won our apartment back!
ДЖОУИ: What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
МОНИКА: No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
ФИБИ: I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!

МОНИКА: I don’t know!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tickets please! That’s courtside baby!
ДЖОУИ: Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No they didn’t!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
РОСС: Move in with me.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: Don’t be scared, II know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
РОСС: I know.
НЕДРУГ: My job!
РОСС: Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs that could be you!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life, you come to England.
РОСС: No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here I can’t leave him. Isn’t, you don’t think there’s any way?
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future, and-and-and we were getting married or something.
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it I take it back!
РОСС: No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?
НЕДРУГ: Why don’t we what?
РОСС: Get married.
НЕДРУГ: You are mad!
РОСС: No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.
НЕДРУГ: We’ve only known each other for six weeks!
РОСС: Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?
НЕДРУГ: My parents are going to be really mad.
РОСС: Is that, are you saying yes? Is that yes?
НЕДРУГ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: Yes!
РОСС: Yes! We’re getting married?!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РОСС: Yes!
НЕДРУГ: We’re getting married!
РОСС: Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
НЕДРУГ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, it’s a bit small.
РОСС: Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
НЕДРУГ: It was.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Those were like the best seats ever.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. Oh, God!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, want a beer? WHOA!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I KNOW!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Open up! Open up! Open up!
МОНИКА: We’ll discuss it, in the morning!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What the hell is going on?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We took our apartment back!
ФИБИ: I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are switching back, right now!
МОНИКА: No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t want to move again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole, you stole it, our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let us keep the apartment and.
МОНИКА: As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Totally worth it!
ДЖОУИ: That was one good minute!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good night.
ДЖОУИ: Good night.
МОНИКА: Men are such idiots.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
ФИБИ: That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
МОНИКА: Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Okay, scarf’s done.
РОСС: Come on! Come on. Come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: What-what’s going on?
ДЖОУИ: Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
РОСС: Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
ФИБИ: What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
НЕДРУГ: Umm, no.
МОНИКА: When, when did, how, how did you.
РОСС: We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
НЕДРУГ: I mean, we know it’s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so.
РОСС: Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, II heard. I think it’s great! Ohh, I’m so happy for you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well, that’s great!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe you’re getting married!
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Monica and Rachel made out.
НЕДРУГ: Morning’s here! The morning’s here!
НЕДРУГ: Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You’re back!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Get into gear!
НЕДРУГ: Breakfast is near!
НЕДРУГ: The dark of night has disappeared!
НЕДРУГ: I’ll see you tomorrow morning!
ДЖОУИ: Okay!
