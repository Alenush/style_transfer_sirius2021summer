ФИБИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
ФИБИ: Ha-ha. No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I - my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right.
ФИБИ: Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
ДЖОУИ: Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
ФИБИ: I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
ФИБИ: Hey! What are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
ФИБИ: Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
НЕДРУГ: No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
НЕДРУГ: Don’t get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
ФИБИ: Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
НЕДРУГ: You think about it.
НЕДРУГ: I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?
РОСС: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, it’s time to go.
РОСС: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
НЕДРУГ: Well that’s ambitious.
РОСС: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
НЕДРУГ: That’s Carol with your son!
РОСС: Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.
НЕДРУГ: Ross!
РОСС: I’ll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, it’s so nice to finally meet you!
НЕДРУГ: Me too!
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, y’know, Susan’s gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, I’m so excited, I’ve never been there.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, I’ll show you around.
НЕДРУГ: That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff, I’ll go with you!
НЕДРУГ: Ahh!
РОСС: Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so.
НЕДРУГ: Are you all right?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine. It’s just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me.
РОСС: Oh come on! That’s-that’s, true.
ФИБИ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
ФИБИ: Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
ФИБИ: No, I’mI’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with The.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. Where is everybody? Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
ДЖОУИ: What do ya say? What do ya say?
ФИБИ: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don’t, maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.
ДЖОУИ: I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.
МОНИКА: Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.
МОНИКА: Um-hmm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What am I making him by the way?
МОНИКА: Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I thought I was making him filet mignon?
МОНИКА: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: So uh, Emily called last night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And now you’re giving me the message!
РОСС: Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!
ФИБИ: God, Susan is so fun!
РОСС: Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
РОСС: Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful, didn’t you see Personal Best?
ДЖОУИ: No, but I’m gonna!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
РОСС: How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
РОСС: What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
ФИБИ: No! No! II meant for the baby!
РОСС: Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
ФИБИ: Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never happen to like The Hulk, y’know.
РОСС: Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found, Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian.
ФИБИ: So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Raymond Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: Someone you didn’t make up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
ФИБИ: Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.
ДЖОУИ: All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry man, I didn’t, I’mI’m sorry. I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: So I guess it’s Joey then!
НЕДРУГ: This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!
НЕДРУГ: Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmmm!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I know, my God, this is so, this rice is so, I am so good.
НЕДРУГ: Behind you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here sometimes they migrate back over.
НЕДРУГ: Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And III would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: So, all right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. So, can I serve you a little of, What? What? What?
НЕДРУГ: Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Your parents’?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they’re out of town.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah that works.
НЕДРУГ: They-they-they can smell fear.
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! How’s Ben?
РОСС: Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, No. I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, No. I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, No. So, he’s sweeping.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Ben! Hey!
РОСС: So umm, any word from Susan?
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily.
РОСС: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
НЕДРУГ: What’s too much fun?
РОСС: Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
РОСС: Am I?!
НЕДРУГ: Yes!
РОСС: Am I?!
НЕДРУГ: I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
РОСС: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else. There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?
НЕДРУГ: Maybe.
РОСС: OH MY GOD! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!
НЕДРУГ: and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! This place is fabulous!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi, darling!
НЕДРУГ: Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well we cut the trip short.
НЕДРУГ: France sucks!
НЕДРУГ: Umm, this may be a little weird, but III got a date here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, say no more!
НЕДРУГ: We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we’ll be right out of you hair.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?
НЕДРУГ: Yep, sucks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi you!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I can do more than cook.
НЕДРУГ: I like her. She sees smart.
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, Rachel, my parents.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Hello. Well, Joshua, that 500 was for groceries.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not, that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so. And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, USA not ready.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe in L. A?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes!
НЕДРУГ: There you go.
НЕДРУГ: So, have you kids eaten yet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we were going to do that after, I mean umm, next.
НЕДРУГ: Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to eat?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, well, Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.
НЕДРУГ: So, We go eat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!
ДЖОУИ: It’s not that bad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
ДЖОУИ: So, you’re just Bing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have no name.
ФИБИ: All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
ДЖОУИ: No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
ФИБИ: Umm, Gene.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s Clint. It’s Clint!
ДЖОУИ: See you later, Gene.
ФИБИ: Bye, Gene.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s Clint! Clint!
ДЖОУИ: What’s up with Gene?
МОНИКА: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Oh, no!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs.
РОСС: So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So?
РОСС: So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
МОНИКА: Emily’s straight.
РОСС: Oh, wake up!
ФИБИ: Wow, Carol really messed you up!
РОСС: Excuse me?
ФИБИ: Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
РОСС: Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
МОНИКА: This totally makes sense!
РОСС: It does not!
МОНИКА: Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
ФИБИ: All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely! Absolutely!
МОНИКА: This is so much fun!
РОСС: This is not fun!
МОНИКА: Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
ФИБИ: Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
РОСС: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, yeah, what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
ФИБИ: Drum roll.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
ДЖОУИ: Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
ФИБИ: You’re actually going through with this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women. So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
ФИБИ: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact, yes, I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’mI’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Thanks.
ФИБИ: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna hug it out?
ФИБИ: Yeah!
ФИБИ: Yay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yay!
ФИБИ: Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
ФИБИ: Ooh, uh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye, Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Okay, bye!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ha! Ha! Ha!
ДЖОУИ: Ohh!
РОСС: Nice luggage.
НЕДРУГ: I was gonna say.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! I missed you.
РОСС: Oh, I missed you too.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, so did I.
РОСС: No tongue.
