ФИБИ: My little brother is married! 
НЕДРУГ: I know! 
НЕДРУГ: 
ФИБИ: You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, what happened was, we were at the courthouse, and we were having lunch... 
ФИБИ: Wait, wait. Why were you at the courthouse? 
НЕДРУГ: We were having lunch. Yeah, and then, all of a sudden, we were like, "We're here, we're having lunch, let's get married, right!" 
ФИБИ: Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too! 
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
ФИБИ: So, ooh, I'm going to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: We've been trying to get pregnant, uh, pretty much ever since we got engaged. We thought we'd get a jump on things. You know, no one's getting any younger. 
НЕДРУГ: 'cause the thing is, uh, we're not able to, you know, uh, conceive, you know. 
НЕДРУГ: We've tried everything; we've seen a bunch of doctors. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, and they say, they say that our only chance to have a baby is if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish, and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into. 
ФИБИ: That's a really *nice* gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat. 
ДЖОУИ: Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well you said *black*. Why would he want his blue blazer black? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you, you know what I meant. 
МОНИКА: No, you've messed it up. You're stupid. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what job did you get Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something? 
ДЖОУИ: No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period." 
НЕДРУГ: Nice, all right, yeah! 
РОСС: Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but I can pronounce "Jurassic". 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Guess what? Frank Jr. and Alice got married. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, that's great! 
ФИБИ: And they're going to have a baby! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, that's great! 
ФИБИ: Yeah! And they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. 
НЕДРУГ: 
РОСС: Oh my God. 
МОНИКА: Are you serious? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: You're really thinking of having sex with your brother? 
НЕДРУГ: 
ФИБИ: Eww! And no, no! They want me to be the surrogate. It's her egg and his sperm. I'm just the oven. It's totally their bun. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: What did you tell them? 
ФИБИ: Well, they said I had to think about it first. But what is there to think of? I'm going to be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant. 
ФИБИ: I know. 
РОСС: Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, what's your point? 
РОСС: The stuff I just mentioned. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper. 
ФИБИ: You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture. 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: We just want you to think it through. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom. 
ФИБИ: My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did! 
НЕДРУГ: Mmmm, I love this tushie. Can I take it to work with me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Right where? 
МОНИКА: In the beginning, you know, where it's all sex and talking and sex and talking... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking. 
МОНИКА: And the sex? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, that is so nice. 
РОСС: Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, he's right, I'm totally lying. 
МОНИКА: Then what is it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey. 
РОСС: And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him. 
РОСС: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes and I was saying the actual words. 
МОНИКА: Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot. 
МОНИКА: Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The sex is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Just go for it Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you should. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period. 
НЕДРУГ: Isn't the Mastadon from the Pliocene Epoch? 
ДЖОУИ: Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. Okay, now right down here we have, uh... a large foot. 
РОСС: 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, moving right along. Come on. 
НЕДРУГ: It's open, come in. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
ФИБИ: Sorry I'm late. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's okay. It gave me time to, uh, finish glazing my nipples. 
ФИБИ: Wow, you really go all out for company. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I was working on my pottery. 
ФИБИ: Oh, OH! Oh, I didn't know you did...pot. 
НЕДРУГ: Y-yeah. Mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica. 
ФИБИ: Oh, ooh! Erotery! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Okay! Well, thanks for coming out to see me. I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I really don't think it's a very good idea Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Why not? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, because, you'd be giving up a baby. And, uh, I don't know if there's anything I can say that can make you understand the pain of giving up a baby, so, um... 
ФИБИ: Oh, I understand. Don't, don't hurt the puppy. 
НЕДРУГ: No no, the puppy is for you. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I get a puppy? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, yeah. But, only for three days. 
ФИБИ: Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know, I realize that I don't have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything, but, um, er, .. Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies. And I only wish that I had someone there who had given up babies who could have told me how terrible it is to give up a baby. 
ФИБИ: 
НЕДРУГ: I just think it would be something that you would regret every day for the rest of your life. So, however hard it is for you to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. 
ФИБИ: Mom: I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first. 
ФИБИ: All right, it's okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: You mean Dr. Geller? 
ДЖОУИ: Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there and only the people with the blue blazers sit over here. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, uh, how come? 
НЕДРУГ: That's just the way it is. 
ДЖОУИ: That's crazy. 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world -- a world without lab coats or blazers. But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now. See that scientist with the glasses? He and I used to play together all the time in grade school. Hmph, but now... 
ДЖОУИ: I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it. 
ДЖОУИ: Ross, Ross, over here man. I saved you a seat. 
РОСС: That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later. 
НЕДРУГ: Oops, this is saved. 
НЕДРУГ: Gift shop. 
РОСС: Hey. Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria. 
ДЖОУИ: It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right? 
РОСС: It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides *never* sit together. 
ДЖОУИ: Whatever. 
РОСС: It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right? 
МОНИКА: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden? 
ФИБИ: Oh, you know what? I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony. 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: Uh, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Oh, listen, don't go on the balcony until I get back. 
МОНИКА: So, did you do it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes, we had the sex. 
МОНИКА: Uh-oh, was it bad? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, "Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it." 
МОНИКА: Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree like that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always... nice. But I need to know what makes it go from "nice" to "My God, somebody's killing her in there!" 
МОНИКА: All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. All right. Now... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't have to draw an actual wo -- Woah, she' hot. 
МОНИКА: Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, one, two, three, , four , five, six, and seven. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There are seven? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let me see that. Oh yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's one? 
МОНИКА: Kind of an important one. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you know what, I was looking at it upside down. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you know, sometimes that helps. 
МОНИКА: Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that's bad? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you might if it were anything like seven. 
МОНИКА: All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, TOES!! Yeah, for some people. 
МОНИКА: Okay, you could, uh, start with a little one; a two; a one, two, three; a three; a five; a four, a three-two; a two, a two-four -six; two-four-six; four a two; two; four-seven; five-seven ; six-seven; seven, seven, SEVEN, SEVEN, SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN- SEVEN-SEVEN! 
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here. 
РОСС: Thank you Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table in the middle. I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me. 
ДЖОУИ: I will sit with you Dr. Geller. 
РОСС: You know, we work in the Museum of Natural History, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see? I see division. Division between people with white coats and people in blue blazers. And I ask, myself, my God, WHY? Now I say, we shed these coats that separate us and get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross. I'm divorced, and I have a kid. 
ДЖОУИ: I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me. 
РОСС: All right, there you go. 
ДЖОУИ: You hang in there Ted! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear 
РОСС: Okay, okay, good for you. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real! 
РОСС: oh, uh, er, Wow, Rhonda. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Scott. 
РОСС: Ah, okay Scott! 
НЕДРУГ: I have to turn the light switch on and off 17 times before leaving a room or my family will die. 
ФИБИ: My mom's going to be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
ФИБИ: Yes, no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I can't watch this. It's like "Sophie's Choice." 
МОНИКА: You know, I never saw that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it was only okay. 
ФИБИ: My mom was right. If I can't give *him* up, there's no way I can give up a little baby. Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed. What, what else can I give them? A kidney? 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: We were just in the neighbourhood, so... 
НЕДРУГ: So we thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure. 
НЕДРУГ: None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just going to be right over there drinking coffee. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Who is this little guy? Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumor. 
НЕДРУГ: You are so precious, I could just take you home. 
ФИБИ: Hey, why don't you? 
НЕДРУГ: Are you serious? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks. 
МОНИКА: What are you doing? 
ФИБИ: No, I'm really okay with this. You know why? Cause look at them. Look how happy there are. And I made that. I know it's going to be like a million times harder to give up a baby but oh my God! It's going to feel like a million times better, right? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Oh! Thank you so much. You don't know what this means to us. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry. Oh my God. 
МОНИКА: It's going to be so great. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: What's going on? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm going to carry their baby. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe... 
ФИБИ: No, no, I know. You and I are totally different people. And this is a totally different situation. And I know that I'm not going to regret this. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I know. I understand all that. It's just...that was my puppy. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! 
МОНИКА: Would you surrogate? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Depends who asked. 
МОНИКА: What if I asked? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Mon. Sure. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're not asking me, are you? 
МОНИКА: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, totally. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, thank you!
