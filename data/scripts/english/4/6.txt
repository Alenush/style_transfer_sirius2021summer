НЕДРУГ: So, thank you for the delicious dinner. 
РОСС: You're welcome for a delicious dinner. 
ФИБИ: Hey what are you guys looking at? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, come to papa. 
РОСС: I know! 
МОНИКА: Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what? 
РОСС: Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. 
РОСС: I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek. 
РОСС: Fine by me; hope she wins. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper? 
ФИБИ: Oo! Is it for my birthday present? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I have a call in about that. 
ФИБИ: 'Kay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, honey, that's so sweet. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!" 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It doesn't say that. Does it? 
РОСС: How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great. 
ФИБИ: It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! What happened? 
МОНИКА: Sixty guests. 
РОСС: So, uh, why did you have to turn it down? 
МОНИКА: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way. 
ФИБИ: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not? 
МОНИКА: I don't know. 
ФИБИ: There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving! 
МОНИКА: Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff. 
ФИБИ: Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months. 
МОНИКА: Well, you're not working either. 
ФИБИ: Yes, but I'm doing this. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Can I borrow the keys to your apartment? 
ДЖОУИ: Why? 
ДЖОУИ: You can pee here! 
НЕДРУГ: Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? 
ДЖОУИ: We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I know... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love." 
ФИБИ: Ooo, a crossword! Can I help? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help. 
ФИБИ: Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, how'd it go? 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident! 
ФИБИ: Mon! I'm so happy for you! 
МОНИКА: Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order! 
ФИБИ: I'll have one, please. Plus my money. 
МОНИКА: Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that. 
ФИБИ: Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РОСС: Huh... 
НЕДРУГ: Um, would you like to come in? 
РОСС: Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools? 
НЕДРУГ: According to recent findings! 
НЕДРУГ: Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi! 
РОСС: Mitzi is..... 
НЕДРУГ: My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat. 
РОСС: Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties? 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РОСС: Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh... 
НЕДРУГ: I'd rather not. 
РОСС: Oh, yeah, why not? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell. 
МОНИКА: Oh, is everything in the car? 
ФИБИ: Yes. Did you settle the bill? 
МОНИКА: No. I hate this part. 
ФИБИ: Oh, look what we almost left. 
МОНИКА: No, that's not mine. 
ФИБИ: Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! 
МОНИКА: Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, good. Thank you. 
МОНИКА: Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of... 
НЕДРУГ: Dear? 
МОНИКА: Just the matter of ...payment? 
НЕДРУГ: Jack used to handle the finances! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know... um, Grease? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rent? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Rent! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so when do you want to go? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, it is, at Office Max. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What did you get her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A pen. 
ДЖОУИ: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh-huh! You can't give her that. 
ДЖОУИ: Why not? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday? 
ДЖОУИ: She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For three years? 
ДЖОУИ: Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you like me to write her a little poem as well? 
ДЖОУИ: Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. 
ФИБИ: But Mon, you have to get our money! 
МОНИКА: Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant. 
ФИБИ: I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was? 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!" 
МОНИКА: Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking? 
ФИБИ: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. 
НЕДРУГ: You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave.... 
ФИБИ: She seems fine now. 
НЕДРУГ: ...emblem of the land I love. The home of.... 
ДЖОУИ: So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? 
РОСС: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? 
РОСС: What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. 
РОСС: No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell. 
ДЖОУИ: What kind of smell? 
РОСС: I don't know. Soap? 
ДЖОУИ: All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: You wanna see her again, right? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! 
РОСС: Yeah, okay you're right. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
РОСС: It's, uh... it's endearing, really. 
ДЖОУИ: All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Any luck? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw, honey, that's so sweet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Pathetic! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where? 
ДЖОУИ: Our place, the hall! I... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got something for her. It's a book! 
ДЖОУИ: A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? 
ДЖОУИ: You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it came out to an even twenty. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow. That's almost as much as a new book. 
НЕДРУГ: Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes? 
ФИБИ: You didn't get the money, did you? 
МОНИКА: Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go! 
ФИБИ: No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow? 
НЕДРУГ: Come on along and listen to... 
ФИБИ: Okay, Widow! 
НЕДРУГ: ...the lullabye of... 
ФИБИ: Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. I'll get my bag. 
ФИБИ: Good. 
МОНИКА: I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event. 
НЕДРУГ: So you want to come inside? 
РОСС: Yes. Yes I do. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. 
НЕДРУГ: Guess who? 
РОСС: Department of Sanitation? 
НЕДРУГ: It's me! 
РОСС: Oh! Ah. Aw! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РОСС: Ah, Cheryl! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Ross! 
НЕДРУГ: Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi! 
РОСС: Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug! 
НЕДРУГ: Move! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me! 
ФИБИ: Uh... yay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks! 
МОНИКА: Oh, that's great! Congratulations! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go? 
МОНИКА: Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. I'm a hard ass. 
МОНИКА: And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime! 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together! 
ФИБИ: Okay! 
МОНИКА: I can cook and you can take care of the money. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties! 
НЕДРУГ: Aah! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? That's great! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aahhuuhhh.... 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Happy birthday. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you! 
ДЖОУИ: You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No he didn't. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy birthday! I'm sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: You really didn't have to. Wow. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah... yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed? 
НЕДРУГ: I'll be in in a minute. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Goodnight. 
НЕДРУГ: Um, thank you for the gift. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, the book? 
НЕДРУГ: The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell." 
НЕДРУГ: You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. 
НЕДРУГ: Well.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Goodnight. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that coupon expires, you know. 
МОНИКА: Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it? 
МОНИКА: No?
