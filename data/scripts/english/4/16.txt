МОНИКА: What is it hon?
ФИБИ: II can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake, ooh! Cake! No.
МОНИКА: Aww, honey I’m sorry.
ФИБИ: God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
ДЖОУИ: Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.
ФИБИ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
ФИБИ: Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it’s a pickle?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you writing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style, what did you throw away?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi guys!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what have you guys been up too?
РОСС: Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the CupertHewitt museum.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Without me?!
НЕДРУГ: My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
МОНИКА: I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.
НЕДРУГ: I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It’s a joke.
РОСС: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya. Buh-bye then.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
РОСС: Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.
МОНИКА: Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
РОСС: Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.
ДЖОУИ: Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.
РОСС: Pheebs!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: Hello! Hello!
ФИБИ: Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!
ФИБИ: Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
ФИБИ: That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.
НЕДРУГ: Okay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
НЕДРУГ: Why not?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that’s because of a lot of,
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, they ruin it for everybody.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know!
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting.
НЕДРУГ: Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.
НЕДРУГ: Then uh, what’s-what’s this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking about?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, what’ going on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
РОСС: Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.
ДЖОУИ: Awwww!
НЕДРУГ: Hello?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Surprise!
НЕДРУГ: Surprise!
НЕДРУГ: No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it was all Ross’s idea.
НЕДРУГ: You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!
РОСС: You really didn’t know?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like what?
ДЖОУИ: What-what-what is so funny?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said, Like what?
ДЖОУИ: Now that’s a thinker.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Care for a cherry?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
НЕДРУГ: You okay? You all right?
РОСС: So we should probably get going soon.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!
РОСС: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.
НЕДРУГ: So why did you plan a party at the same time?
РОСС: No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, Surprise! And then, Oh my God, I’m so surprised, good-bye!
НЕДРУГ: But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
РОСС: Monica said that did she?
ФИБИ: Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
ДЖОУИ: A little salami.
ФИБИ: Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
ДЖОУИ: Pastrami.
ФИБИ: Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Up!
МОНИКА: You changed?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
МОНИКА: And lucky means, more cleavage?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
ДЖОУИ: Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ДЖОУИ: There was a scene in Footloose.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Flashdance.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was a welder.
ДЖОУИ: What? Were you like in the movie, or, Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
МОНИКА: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s not Christmas!
МОНИКА: Or Spin the Bottle?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He’s not 11!
НЕДРУГ: Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You’re leaving?!
РОСС: Yes, we have something we have to get to.
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, yeah, I think I’m going to take-off too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
РОСС: What big thing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. All right. Who wants to go first?
НЕДРУГ: I’ll go.
НЕДРУГ: Yay!
ДЖОУИ: Welcome to America.
МОНИКА: Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yay! Emily!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are the odds? What are the odds?
РОСС: Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.
ДЖОУИ: If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, my turn!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! The baby just kicked!
НЕДРУГ: Ohh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just a bug.
ФИБИ: Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
ФИБИ: I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
ДЖОУИ: All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?
ФИБИ: Yeah, totally!
ДЖОУИ: All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong, do it right!
ДЖОУИ: Feel better now?
ФИБИ: Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
ФИБИ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.
ФИБИ: Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.
ДЖОУИ: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?
РОСС: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
НЕДРУГ: But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
МОНИКА: RachelRachelRachel II cannot, I can’t let, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Nice uh, costume.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’
НЕДРУГ: E!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gimme an ‘M!’
НЕДРУГ: M!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gimme an ‘I!’
НЕДРУГ: I!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gimme an ‘L!’
НЕДРУГ: L!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gimme a ‘Y!’
НЕДРУГ: Y!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you get? Emily! Emil, Whoa! Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
НЕДРУГ: Are you all right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
МОНИКА: I think you’re done.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, time to take off the bra.
НЕДРУГ: Umm, that was really great, but II gotta take-off actually.
ДЖОУИ: Take the bra off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel is my girlfriend.
НЕДРУГ: So, this was uh, really fun.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y’know, this bra, Really, bothers me. Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories?
НЕДРУГ: Need uh, need a little hand there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
НЕДРУГ: You really don’t seem like you do. That’s.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ughhhh! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
НЕДРУГ: Well, what was supposed to happen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
НЕДРУГ: Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, II don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!
НЕДРУГ: No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?!
НЕДРУГ: Because II like you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You like me?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated, a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
НЕДРУГ: But.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
НЕДРУГ: Okay uh, however.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.
НЕДРУГ: My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.
РОСС: That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
РОСС: Helps a little.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
РОСС: Yeah, have a seat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m so sorry.
РОСС: That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?
РОСС: What do you mean?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You seem to really like her.
РОСС: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
РОСС: You think?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
РОСС: Hey, you’re right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Thanks. What photo album was it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
РОСС: Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re a pathetic loser, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho, yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sit!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my gosh, Joshua!
НЕДРУГ: All those things I said about not being ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They’re not true?
НЕДРУГ: No, they’re-they’re all true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: But.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh, I love that but.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Every time.
ДЖОУИ: Oooh, what you got there?
ФИБИ: Pastrami.
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?
ДЖОУИ: Hm-mm, corn beef.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
ФИБИ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
ФИБИ: Six months.
ДЖОУИ: Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
ФИБИ: Not if I get there first.
