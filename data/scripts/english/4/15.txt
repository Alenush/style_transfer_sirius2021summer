ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm.
НЕДРУГ: OH MY GAWD!
МОНИКА: Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, Nothing.
МОНИКА: Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
ДЖОУИ: I know what it did! Nothing.
МОНИКА: They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
ДЖОУИ: Like this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
ДЖОУИ: Sure! It flushes it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Ah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Guess who we ran into today?!
МОНИКА: Janice?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Isn't this amazing?
МОНИКА: How have you been?
НЕДРУГ: Oh well, I'm divorced.
ФИБИ: Ohhh, wow.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
ДЖОУИ: And there it is.
НЕДРУГ: I just came up to say, Hi! Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: B-bye!
НЕДРУГ: Bye-bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye. I can't stand the woman!
ФИБИ: What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality. Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
ДЖОУИ: So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
РОСС: No, it's really not that bad. I mean, II for one, feel perfectly safe.
РОСС: Help! Help! Help! Help!
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, mate.
НЕДРУГ: How are ya man?
РОСС: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
НЕДРУГ: So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
НЕДРУГ: Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. I think you're right.
НЕДРУГ: Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Liam.
РОСС: Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something or should I call it football?
НЕДРУГ: We were playing rugby.
НЕДРУГ: In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
НЕДРУГ: Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
РОСС: What's ah, what's so funny about that?
НЕДРУГ: Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
РОСС: Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so.
НЕДРУГ: So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
НЕДРУГ: Cheers!
РОСС: Cheers!
НЕДРУГ: Oh boy, I just love to sing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, II know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship.
НЕДРУГ: I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
НЕДРУГ: Oh no! Where to? To-oo Paris?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! Not, Paris.
НЕДРУГ:Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
НЕДРУГ: When?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know exactly.
НЕДРУГ: Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
МОНИКА: Done?
ФИБИ: Yep!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! What's up?
МОНИКА: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
ДЖОУИ: I bet I stopped listening before you did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
МОНИКА: Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's coming from Joey!
ФИБИ: Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!
ФИБИ: Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
РОСС: Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
НЕДРУГ: Hey there Ross!
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Janice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, II thought I did but, II guess I did not!
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, what's going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'mI'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks for telling me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
ДЖОУИ: Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, Chandler, come on!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
ДЖОУИ: Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
РОСС: Hey, I can handle it! All right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
РОСС: That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
РОСС: And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
ДЖОУИ: Ross! They're gonna kill you!
ФИБИ: Well, why are you doing this anyway?
РОСС: Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
ФИБИ: You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
РОСС: Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
ДЖОУИ: All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks!
РОСС: Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
ДЖОУИ: RossRossRossRoss! Stay away from that guy, and that guy. And that one Dude! They're all huge!
РОСС: They don't look any bigger than me!
ДЖОУИ: Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
НЕДРУГ: I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
РОСС: All right.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Hi.
ФИБИ: Whoa! I kinda liked it.
РОСС: Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
ДЖОУИ: I totally don't know what you're talking about.
РОСС: Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!
ДЖОУИ: No.
РОСС: You'll see.
НЕДРУГ: Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
НЕДРУГ: You don't say!
НЕДРУГ: Good luck, babe.
НЕДРУГ: Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
НЕДРУГ: Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
РОСС: JOEY!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
МОНИКА: He asked you out?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
МОНИКА: Saucy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are these?
МОНИКА: Electrical plans for the building.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
МОНИКА: I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay 25 and wait in line for three hours.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! If only more people knew.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
НЕДРУГ: Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
НЕДРУГ: On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
НЕДРУГ: One ticket to Yemen?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
НЕДРУГ: Are you travelling with a child?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is 2,100 and we don't take library cards.
НЕДРУГ: What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: American Express?
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
ФИБИ: No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so.
НЕДРУГ: That's just halftime, there's more of this.
РОСС: Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
НЕДРУГ: Right.
РОСС: Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: Thanks. II think I'm dying. I really do.
ФИБИ: Oh, poor baby.
РОСС: Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
НЕДРУГ: Ross, they are killing you out there!
РОСС: That's not true!
ФИБИ: She's right! You have to stop!
РОСС: What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
ДЖОУИ: Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
РОСС: I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
НЕДРУГ: All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
РОСС: No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
НЕДРУГ: No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
РОСС: I like that.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
РОСС: Huh?
НЕДРУГ: One swift kick and he'll back off.
РОСС: All right, bad ankle, got it!
НЕДРУГ: And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
РОСС: Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
НЕДРУГ: And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
РОСС: But-but, Liam's on my team.
НЕДРУГ: I don't care! You just get him!
РОСС: I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
ДЖОУИ: The Red Ross! Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what are-what are these?
МОНИКА: Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
МОНИКА: No-no-no, no!
МОНИКА: I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Look at this!
МОНИКА: Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
МОНИКА: I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And did you?!
МОНИКА: No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
МОНИКА: But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God.
НЕДРУГ: Hello darling.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
ФИБИ: Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
РОСС: Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean III was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sure.
РОСС: No, not you.
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
ФИБИ: Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
НЕДРУГ: You were amazing out there.
РОСС: Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РОСС: I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
НЕДРУГ: You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
РОСС: Please! Are you kidding? II hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose, I mean II'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
НЕДРУГ: I think you've got concussion.
РОСС: No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
РОСС: It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
НЕДРУГ: This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, II guess I gotta go.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Well, I'll write you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
НЕДРУГ: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
НЕДРУГ: No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
МОНИКА: All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A 200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank God.
МОНИКА: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
ФИБИ: See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
