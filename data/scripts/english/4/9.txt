ФИБИ: Okay!
МОНИКА: Come on, no peeking!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
ФИБИ: Okayyyyy, open up!
РОСС: What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
ФИБИ: Yeah, it's for our catering business!
ДЖОУИ: I think I know that girl.
МОНИКА: All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No?
ФИБИ: No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ФИБИ: And also, we don't know what to do with this.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
МОНИКА: Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
ФИБИ: Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
МОНИКА: Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
МОНИКА: Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence, dozens of people.
ФИБИ: How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
МОНИКА: Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
НЕДРУГ: Yay!
ФИБИ: Oh, in that case, Yay! That was me hopping on board.
МОНИКА: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
РОСС: I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
РОСС: Nooo! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
РОСС: Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
ФИБИ: Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
РОСС: Mike Gandolf Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
РОСС: I'm gonna call after you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
НЕДРУГ: Woooo!
МОНИКА: All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
ДЖОУИ: Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
РОСС: Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
ДЖОУИ: Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
РОСС: Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
ДЖОУИ: No, I had sex in high school.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
НЕДРУГ: Really? Well, in that case.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And that's I'm so glad there's no problem.
НЕДРУГ: That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! That's great!
НЕДРУГ: You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?!
НЕДРУГ: No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I, umm.
НЕДРУГ: Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh man! I am so excited, I may vomit!
ДЖОУИ: Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
ДЖОУИ: Really?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
РОСС: Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
ДЖОУИ: All right, I'll see you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Whoa-whoa-whoa!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
ДЖОУИ: I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
РОСС: Somewhere maybe along the equator?
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello. It's Gandolf! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
РОСС: What happened?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
РОСС: Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stupid, useless Canadian money!
НЕДРУГ: You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
НЕДРУГ: I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: III of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
НЕДРУГ: Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I realize that.
НЕДРУГ: And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I love working with designers!
НЕДРУГ: With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
МОНИКА: Hey! My first review is out!
ФИБИ: Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
МОНИКА: All right, look at my on the back page.
ФИБИ: Oh, okay! Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head. Wow! You really laid into this place.
МОНИКА: Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
ФИБИ: Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
МОНИКА: Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
ФИБИ: No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
МОНИКА: Haven't we made this decision?
ФИБИ: Yeah, all right.
МОНИКА: Bye!
ФИБИ: Bye!
МОНИКА: Who is it?
НЕДРУГ: It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
МОНИКА: Oh my God.
НЕДРУГ: I want to talk to you about your review.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
НЕДРУГ: Why? So you could hang up on me?
МОНИКА: Look, II'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
НЕДРУГ: Just give me a chance too.
ФИБИ: Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
МОНИКА: No! Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Hey, Monica!
НЕДРУГ: I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
МОНИКА: I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
НЕДРУГ: Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
МОНИКА: The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
НЕДРУГ: Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
МОНИКА: All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
НЕДРУГ: Lebanon.
МОНИКА: Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
НЕДРУГ: How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
НЕДРУГ: I thought it went very well.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There's nobody here!
НЕДРУГ: Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
НЕДРУГ: She's not making me uncomfortable.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you want me to quit?
НЕДРУГ: What?! What would make you think that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
НЕДРУГ: Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My drinking?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I must've said that after you left.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Said what? Exactly.
НЕДРУГ: That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
НЕДРУГ: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Say more things like that.
НЕДРУГ: You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'd need an expense account.
НЕДРУГ: Done!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And an assistant.
НЕДРУГ: Sophie, get in here!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
РОСС: It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
ДЖОУИ: So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
РОСС: No! I balanced my checkbook.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, and II gave first names to all of the foosball players.
РОСС: I can't believe he didn't come!
ДЖОУИ: So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
РОСС: Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
ДЖОУИ: Well, we could do that!
РОСС: There's other stuff too.
ДЖОУИ: We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
РОСС: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: It's not like we don't know how to party!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! All right? Let's go!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right!
РОСС: Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
РОСС: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, those were seals, man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
МОНИКА: Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
МОНИКА: Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, you've waited soo long.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
ФИБИ: I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and You got the job!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes!
МОНИКА: You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
ФИБИ: Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
МОНИКА: Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well III think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
ФИБИ: But we've only had one job.
МОНИКА: I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
ФИБИ: Yeah! What are you saying?
МОНИКА: I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
ФИБИ: You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
МОНИКА: All right. But umm, III'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
ФИБИ: For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, wait a minute!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm an assistant buyer!
ДЖОУИ: All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, all right.
РОСС: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: So, we're having fun, right?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
РОСС: I'm kinda beat.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, me too.
ДЖОУИ: Are you serious?!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Thank God! I'm exhausted!
НЕДРУГ: So you guys want coffees?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
РОСС: Yeah, me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
ДЖОУИ: I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
РОСС: I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
РОСС: How sad are we?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
РОСС: And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
ДЖОУИ: We're 29, we're not women.
МОНИКА: Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'mI'm glad you decided to hear me out.
ФИБИ: Okay, I'm hearing.
МОНИКА: I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
ФИБИ: What?!
МОНИКА: Or! A bakery delivery person.
ФИБИ: I waI waI wa.
МОНИКА: Pizza?!
ФИБИ: Monica!
МОНИКА: All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
ФИБИ: No.
МОНИКА: Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
ФИБИ: No.
МОНИКА: Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
ФИБИ: Really?! Are you sure?
МОНИКА: Yeah, y'know II made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
ФИБИ: Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
МОНИКА: Really?!
ФИБИ: Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ФИБИ: Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new ATeam.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Heard what?
НЕДРУГ: Joanna passed away last night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! How?!
НЕДРУГ: Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
НЕДРУГ: I know!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
НЕДРУГ: I didn't realize that she was so close.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened.
НЕДРУГ: No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us nothing about an assistant buyer?
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
НЕДРУГ: Good morning!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.
НЕДРУГ: I sure did!
НЕДРУГ: I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
МОНИКА:' Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe. Are you gonna kill me?
