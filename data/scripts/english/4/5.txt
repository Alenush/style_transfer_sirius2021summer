РОСС: Hello! What's this? Oh right it`s that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. 
ФИБИ: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: When's your birthday? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: May fifth, why? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays. 
РОСС: Oh, mine's December... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, whatever. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty. 
МОНИКА: Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I could die. 
РОСС: Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I tell people secrets. It makes them like me. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there. 
ФИБИ: But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice? 
МОНИКА: Just be yourself. But, not too much. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wish me luck. 
РОСС: Good luck! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that? 
НЕДРУГ: No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh Kathy, with K or a C? 
НЕДРУГ: With a K. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oh-hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! You are really good at this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I see you guys already met, huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth. 
ДЖОУИ: Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off. 
ФИБИ: Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smellycat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! That's why I got up too! 
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding! Oh, I love him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh please! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh-oh-oh-oh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it on? 
НЕДРУГ: No, but this wonder broom is amazing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! It's on! It's on! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There we go little fella. 
НЕДРУГ: What about the duck? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well the duck can swim. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, jeez. 
ФИБИ: My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. 
НЕДРУГ: Way to go, Phoebe! 
МОНИКА: That cold makes you sound so great. 
ФИБИ: It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters. 
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, have fun! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what, I like Kathy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, she's... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You love her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don't. 
ФИБИ: Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy. 
РОСС: Come on, Pheebs lay off him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you, Ross. 
РОСС: Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. 
МОНИКА: Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! 
ФИБИ: So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me. 
МОНИКА: Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing. 
РОСС: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
РОСС: So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight! 
МОНИКА: Rachel's not here. 
РОСС: Oh. 
МОНИКА: How's it going with her? 
РОСС: Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross. 
МОНИКА: Hi, Josh. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Dudes. 
МОНИКА: So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.) 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. I'll miss you. 
НЕДРУГ: Dope! 
ФИБИ: Wow, cute one! 
МОНИКА: Very! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum. 
РОСС: Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom? 
РОСС: Oh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What was that? 
РОСС: Monica knows. 
МОНИКА: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother. 
РОСС: Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РОСС: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Ben! 
РОСС: Wow! You-you look great! 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks! 
РОСС: Okay! Hey Tommy. 
НЕДРУГ: I am so glad that you could come over tonight. 
РОСС: Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month. 
РОСС: I-I-I... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. 
РОСС: Who wants to make some long distance calls? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!" 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was. 
РОСС: Her date tipped me ten dollars. 
РОСС: Pheebs, what are you doing? 
ФИБИ: Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
РОСС: Are you serious? 
ФИБИ: Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler! 
МОНИКА: Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold. 
ФИБИ: You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: We were just talking about you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right in there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate. 
ДЖОУИ: It's 4:30. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I see what's going on here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You-you do? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! You don't like Kathy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got me. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Right. 
ДЖОУИ: Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Ross isn't here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Stop it! 
НЕДРУГ: So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh! 
МОНИКА: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think he's stealing from me. 
МОНИКА: Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because he's stealing from me! 
ФИБИ: Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ughh! 
ФИБИ: Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. 
МОНИКА: Thank you so much Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Sure. 
МОНИКА: What are you doing with those?! 
ФИБИ: But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice. 
МОНИКА: Sorry, Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: It's okay. How's the soup? 
МОНИКА: Umm. 
МОНИКА: Ohhhh!! Gross!! 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear! 
ДЖОУИ: Is she great or what? 
НЕДРУГ: So? Huh? What do you think? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh, she's-she's not really my type. 
НЕДРУГ: Not your type?! She's gorgeous! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, no-no thanks. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. 
ДЖОУИ: I'll be right back. What was that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, what do you want from me? 
ДЖОУИ: I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am pretending. 
ДЖОУИ: Well then, do it better! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little. 
РОСС: Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight? 
МОНИКА: No, sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well where's Amanda? 
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out. 
МОНИКА: Ross, cough drops, please? 
РОСС: At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian. 
РОСС: You see Amanda and I have a very special... 
МОНИКА: You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, that is soo sad. 
МОНИКА: And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is -stealing-from-me!' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! 
МОНИКА: That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops! 
РОСС: Fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry. 
РОСС: Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know... 
ФИБИ: Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice? 
НЕДРУГ: I like it. 
ФИБИ: Gunther, kiss me. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I sleep on your couch? 
ФИБИ: And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: So umm, are we cool? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I knew you'd understand.
