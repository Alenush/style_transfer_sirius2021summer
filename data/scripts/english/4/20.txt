НЕДРУГ: You don’t need to fill these silences.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay, thanks.
МОНИКА: Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
МОНИКА: He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you should here me.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: They don’t have those.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!

ДЖОУИ: Ohhh, yeah!
МОНИКА: He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.

ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this,
РОСС: Hey man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing.

РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that’s great.
РОСС: Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so, I mean, II know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know?
ДЖОУИ: Hey! That’s the day after I stop menstruating! This isn’t mine.

НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re clicking.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I, that I think we need, we would need to work on II would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!
НЕДРУГ: II gotta say, IIII’m not too sure I agree with that.

This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, Whoa! Can we do this? Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you’re a real special lady, but my divorce isn’t final yet and, and, and we’ve been on four days, so I’m thinking No, but thanks.

МОНИКА: Congratulations!
ФИБИ: Thank you!
МОНИКА: Okay! My turn! My turn!
ФИБИ: Okay! Okay, ready?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: That was a terrible throw!
ФИБИ: I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!
МОНИКА: Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I think we are.
МОНИКА: This isn’t even my dress.
ФИБИ: Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, It’s Not Too Late.
МОНИКА: I’m changing out of this.
ФИБИ: Me too.
МОНИКА: In like a half-hour?
ФИБИ: Me too.
МОНИКА: Okay, throw it straight this time.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: I’m getting married next!
ФИБИ: Yay!
ФИБИ: I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.
МОНИКА: Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?
ФИБИ: I guess.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Oh God.
ФИБИ: Oh, you’re such a cheater!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello! Little ones.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
ФИБИ: Oh, how’d that happen?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I’m cooler.
МОНИКА: No, seriously.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl, Joey was unconscious.
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys! What’s happening?
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: What is that?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.
МОНИКА: Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!
ДЖОУИ: I know I don’t have too! It tastes good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Plus, you look cool.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I just called Joshua.
ФИБИ: Oh, how did it go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married. I’m just going through a hard time.
ФИБИ: What did he say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
МОНИКА: Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.
ФИБИ: Yeah, maybe.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And II am just trying to figure out why.
ФИБИ: Any luck?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
МОНИКА: Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РОСС: So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
РОСС: Oh, see II don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
РОСС: What happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
РОСС: Noo. Why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, apparently he scares easy.
РОСС: Oh, Rachel, I’mI’m sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.
РОСС: Come here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: You okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I got my girls.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh.
ФИБИ: Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
МОНИКА: Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
МОНИКА: Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay!
МОНИКА: No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!
ФИБИ: No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
ФИБИ: Not after this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
НЕДРУГ: I gotta go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
ДЖОУИ: Dude! I am trying to sleep!
