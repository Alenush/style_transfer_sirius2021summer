ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice! 
ДЖОУИ: How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Monica, it's Chip. 
МОНИКА: Yesss!! 
РОСС: Who's Chip? 
МОНИКА: Shhh! 
НЕДРУГ: Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later. 
МОНИКА: Chip, is Chip Matthews. 
РОСС: The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you? 
МОНИКА: 'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute. 
РОСС: Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!! 
МОНИКА: I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! 
РОСС: I was just leaving. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep. 
РОСС: Why? Did you write it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants? 
РОСС: Well ah, actually... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy. 
РОСС: Well, umm, why don't you give him a call? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this? 
РОСС: Oh, I'm sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh. 
РОСС: Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing! 
ФИБИ: ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks. 
РОСС: Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land. 
РОСС: I'm reading your ad. 
ДЖОУИ: Looks good, uh? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? I love that thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You want it? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer. 
ДЖОУИ: What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nooo. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. What do you do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I actually don't know... 
РОСС: Good, so do I 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Something to do with numbers? 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ФИБИ: Nothing. Nothing. 
ДЖОУИ: What? What's wrong? 
ФИБИ: I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?! 
ФИБИ: No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself. 
РОСС: Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again? 
ФИБИ: No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like ....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years! 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let it go!! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews? 
МОНИКА: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me! 
МОНИКА: What, that little thing at the prom? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch! 
МОНИКА: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?! 
МОНИКА: Look, you and I went to different high schools... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school. 
МОНИКА: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They had to have that specially made?! 
МОНИКА: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot! 
МОНИКА: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you go out with him. 
МОНИКА: Oh, really?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? 
МОНИКА: I'll try. 
РОСС: So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails. 
ФИБИ: Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive. 
РОСС: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us? 
ФИБИ: Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room. 
МОНИКА: Why can't you use the phone in here? 
ФИБИ: Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. 
РОСС: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat? 
МОНИКА: Ross, don't start. 
РОСС: Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I believe it. 
РОСС: No you don't. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I do. 
РОСС: No you do--y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. 
РОСС: I do not always have to be--okay, okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jurassic Park could happen. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice! 
ДЖОУИ: Pretty nice? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. 
НЕДРУГ: We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe. 
НЕДРУГ: You gotta take the canoe! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away! 
НЕДРУГ: We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe! 
ДЖОУИ: Good for you!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar? 
РОСС: Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do we have to tell her? 
РОСС: Yes, we have to tell her! 
МОНИКА: Oh, but it's made her so happy. 
РОСС: Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I hate when Ross is right! 
МОНИКА: He is right, isn't he? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong. 
НЕДРУГ: You think? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-no, he's right. 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Pheebs, about your mom... 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: How's that going? 
ФИБИ: So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred. 
ДЖОУИ: That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee. 
МОНИКА: Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs... 
ФИБИ: I just feel so, uhh..... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm coming already!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jeez! 
МОНИКА: Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello, Chip. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Rach! How ya doin'? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself. 
НЕДРУГ: So ah, Monica ready yet? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch? 
НЕДРУГ: Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready? 
ДЖОУИ: This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin. 
НЕДРУГ: No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit. 
НЕДРУГ: All right, you have yourself a deal. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. See?! I told ya! 
ДЖОУИ: Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!! 
НЕДРУГ: Here, we are. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You still have the Chipper! 
НЕДРУГ: The what? 
МОНИКА: That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I think it's cute. 
МОНИКА: Wow! A lipper from Chipper. 
НЕДРУГ: So you still in touch with anyone from high school? 
МОНИКА: Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly. 
МОНИКА: Is that all? 
НЕДРУГ: Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, how is he? 
НЕДРУГ: Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie. 
МОНИКА: Isn't he an architect now? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they still wear underwear. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OH MY GOD!!! 
ДЖОУИ: WHAT?!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you all right?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened?!! 
ДЖОУИ: Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So--You got in voluntarily?! 
ДЖОУИ: I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: BEND OVER?!!! 
НЕДРУГ: ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! 
МОНИКА: Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work? 
НЕДРУГ: You know where I work! 
МОНИКА: I do? 
НЕДРУГ: The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time. 
МОНИКА: You still work at the multiplex? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room. 
МОНИКА: Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs. 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo. 
ДЖОУИ: Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! What happened? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, how was your date? 
МОНИКА: Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um-hmm. 
МОНИКА: Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, I'm sorry. 
МОНИКА: No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! That's so great! 
МОНИКА: I know! 
РОСС: Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, they said uh, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us." 
РОСС: You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: Yeah? Hi! 
РОСС: Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, sweetie. 
МОНИКА: Hey, we can take her back with you if you want. 
ФИБИ: Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right? 
НЕДРУГ: That's a good call. Right. 
РОСС: No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat! 
ФИБИ: Ross, how many parents have you lost? 
РОСС: None. 
ФИБИ: Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive. 
РОСС: I'm sorry. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РОСС: I don't know what to say. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You could.... say you're sorry to her mom. 
ФИБИ: I think she would like that. 
РОСС: Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother. 
ФИБИ: Thank you. We both forgive you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it. 
ФИБИ: Come on, Mom, I'll take you home. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'll go with you. 
МОНИКА: Me too. 
РОСС: Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
