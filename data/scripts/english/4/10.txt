РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РОСС: I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything? 
ФИБИ: Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. 
РОСС: 15? Your personal best! 
ФИБИ: Where were you? 
РОСС: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her? 
ФИБИ: Oh, which museum? 
ФИБИ: No, answer his. 
РОСС: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were you so late because you were burring this woman? 
РОСС: No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany. 
ДЖОУИ: Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight. 
ФИБИ: Umm, that paper's two weeks old. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang! before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: What's wrong Mon? 
МОНИКА: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat. 
ФИБИ: Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa! 
МОНИКА: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohhh! 
МОНИКА: I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them? 
МОНИКА: I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me? 
МОНИКА: That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter? 
ДЖОУИ: Good enough to get fired. 
МОНИКА: All right, you're hired! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm, I mean, No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay! 
НЕДРУГ: I didn't think you were gay. I do now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel. 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, by the way, that is her full name. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow! I'm free for her! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow? 
НЕДРУГ: Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure! 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!! 
ФИБИ: Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! 
ФИБИ: Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, that's great! 
ФИБИ: Oh, yay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle. 
ФИБИ: I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name! 
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole. 
ФИБИ: All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme? 
МОНИКА: Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! 
ФИБИ: Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello, children! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have I got the 50 guys for you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure! Where are the seats? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wherever! I've got like 20! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, will I like any of these guys? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me? 
ФИБИ: You work with robots!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op, I like credit cards! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, so what does he do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Your company has a fine foods division? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a big company, I don't, if you, I 
ДЖОУИ: Now, wait a second! You make food and robots? 
ФИБИ: No! No, the robots just work for them. 
МОНИКА: All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that! 
МОНИКА: You want a problem? I'll give you a problem! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? 
МОНИКА: You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you. 
РОСС: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! With who? 
РОСС: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
РОСС: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun. 
ФИБИ: If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all? 
РОСС: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, man! 
ФИБИ: Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant? 
ДЖОУИ: Damn! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket? 
МОНИКА: They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: You got it! Oh-oh! 
МОНИКА: What are you doing?! 
ДЖОУИ: It's still a tiny bit on fire there. 
МОНИКА: Thanks. I think you got it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler!! You have the best taste in men! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, like father, like son. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ummmmmmmm, no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get, oh I see. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea. 
МОНИКА: Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday. 
ДЖОУИ: There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers. 
МОНИКА: Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag. Why is nobody writing these down? 
НЕДРУГ: Because we can remember them. 
МОНИКА: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, sure, that too. 
МОНИКА: Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere. 
НЕДРУГ: Can't hear you! 
МОНИКА: A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?! 
ДЖОУИ: No ma'am. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right? 
МОНИКА: What the hell happened?! 
ДЖОУИ: I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!" 
МОНИКА: Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you! 
ДЖОУИ: And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you. 
МОНИКА: What kinda things have you been saying? 
ДЖОУИ: Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in. 
ФИБИ: Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not Jewish, so... 
ФИБИ: So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bad dream? 
РОСС: I wasn't sleeping. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about? 
РОСС: The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date. 
ФИБИ: So, did you pick one yet? 
РОСС: No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought, it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn. 
ФИБИ: Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done! 
РОСС: Y'know, you're right. Thank you. 
ФИБИ: Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Prague? 
ФИБИ: There's sooo much you don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did! I absolutely did! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You idiot!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sure you're right, but why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know! I know! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that sounds fun too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have you ever been with a woman? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So there is no good time to ask that question. 
НЕДРУГ: The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross? Ross! Wake up! Ross! Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!! 
МОНИКА: I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't speak English.

МОНИКА: Fine! 
МОНИКА: Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! 
НЕДРУГ: You found that handle, did ya? 
МОНИКА: That's not funny. 
НЕДРУГ: Well that's not true. 
МОНИКА: I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is.... 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it! 
МОНИКА: You do? 
ДЖОУИ: You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all. 
МОНИКА: Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem! 
ДЖОУИ: What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? 
МОНИКА: You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
МОНИКА: How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now? 
НЕДРУГ: No, it's really good. 
МОНИКА: Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut! 
НЕДРУГ: Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee? 
РОСС: Are we really in Montreal?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes we are. So, coffee? 
РОСС: Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia. 
ДЖОУИ: Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller! 
МОНИКА: Thanks. 
ДЖОУИ: Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year. 
МОНИКА: Enough! 
ДЖОУИ: Lean-lean-lean! 
ФИБИ: "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. '''''''''''''''''' Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. '''''''''''''''''' Said all you need is to write them a song. '''''''''''''''''' They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. '''''''''''''''''' No, don't sing along.
