ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened. 
ДЖОУИ: I know. Ross is getting married. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe is, making people. 
ДЖОУИ: Everybody’s doing stuff! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge! 
ДЖОУИ: We could climb Mt. Everest! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, not something stupid, something huge. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: What-what’s up? 
ДЖОУИ: We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah baby! 
ФИБИ: Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well? 
ДЖОУИ: We could get that Everest video though. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all! 
ДЖОУИ: And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well. 
ФИБИ: So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeeeeahhhh. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah we are! 
НЕДРУГ: So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not? 
РОСС: Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they’re fine. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then? 
РОСС: Sure. Why not? 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
РОСС: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there. 
РОСС: Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that,well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision. More tea? 
РОСС: Yeah sure. 
НЕДРУГ: Earl Grey? 
РОСС: Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want. 
РОСС: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I just want a million dollars! 
МОНИКА: Rachel?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! 
МОНИКА: Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, sure! 
РОСС: Hi. 
РОСС: You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I knew. 
РОСС: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did. 
РОСС: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, maybe... 
РОСС: Okay... okay, maybe I will... 
РОСС:  See, I see.... big passion in your future. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
РОСС: I do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, you're so great. 
ДЖОУИ: It's never gonna happen. 
РОСС: Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK. 
РОСС: OK. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh!!!! 
РОСС: Yes, yes, that's right... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it! 
РОСС: What? Ow! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Did you see that? 
РОСС: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I could not have done this without you. 
РОСС: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine. 
РОСС: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? 
РОСС: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. 
РОСС: Fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. 
РОСС: Good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that... 
РОСС: No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well neither do I! 
РОСС: Is this about Mark? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
РОСС: Okay, it’s not, it’s not. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard. 
РОСС: Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. 
РОСС: Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogurt, or something.. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. A break from us. 
НЕДРУГ: Do I know why we’re rushing? 
РОСС: Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! 
НЕДРУГ: That’s so great for you guys! 
РОСС: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Good luck, with your girlfriend. 
РОСС: Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. 
РОСС: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? 
РОСС: Yes, you can, very much. 
РОСС: Ahhhh!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! 
РОСС: No!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just get out! Now!! 
РОСС: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! All right! How was she? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-oh. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Was she good? 
ДЖОУИ: Don’t answer that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she? 
РОСС: She was... 
ДЖОУИ: Awful! Horrible! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was not good. Not good. 
ДЖОУИ: She was nothing compared to you. 
РОСС: She, she was different. 
ДЖОУИ: Ewwwww! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good different? 
РОСС: Nobody likes change. 
РОСС: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ:  ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."   Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective... 
РОСС: WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You seem to really like her. 
РОСС: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks. 
РОСС: You think? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. 
РОСС: Hey, you’re right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation." 
ФИБИ: Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Noo. 
ДЖОУИ: Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him. 
ФИБИ: I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn’t know that. 
МОНИКА: I never knew that either. 
ДЖОУИ: I knew that! I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey guys! What’s up? 
ДЖОУИ: Heyyy. 
МОНИКА: We’re hanging out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really,I’m-I’m happy. I’ll work on it. 
МОНИКА: I’m sorry honey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, honey, I don’t know. I.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This isn’t one of those uh, y’know "If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket. 
МОНИКА: You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I’ll think about it. Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who's this from? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's Ross's. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered. 
ФИБИ: Remembered what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! 
ФИБИ: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. 
МОНИКА: I can't believe he did this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What did you just say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: F-hah.... flennin.... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.... my God. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ:  Oh my God. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. 
РОСС: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? 
РОСС: Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ:  She didn't hang up either... 
РОСС:  Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-- 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat ......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. 
РОСС: Rach, I got a message from you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . 
РОСС: You're over me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhhhhhh God. 
РОСС: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, ohh. 
РОСС: When, when were you... under me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. 
РОСС: OK, I need to lie down. 
ДЖОУИ: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
РОСС: Really. It's always been you, Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, god. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh. 
РОСС: I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. 
РОСС: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box. 
РОСС: Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to? 
РОСС: Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! 
РОСС: You still love me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo. 
РОСС: What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. 
РОСС: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just, I feel, I-I just... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! 
РОСС: FINE BY ME!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I KNEW IT!!!! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel's coming up the path.  Doesn't she look pretty. Jack... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
МОНИКА: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
РОСС: You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah we do. C'mon. 
НЕДРУГ: Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is. 
МОНИКА: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you? 
МОНИКА: Oh, dad, turn it off. 
НЕДРУГ: It is off.  Right Ross? 
ДЖОУИ: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late. 
МОНИКА: If you're not going then I don't want to go either. 
НЕДРУГ: I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom. 
РОСС: Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no. 
РОСС: OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright. 
НЕДРУГ: C'mon kid, let's go. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, are you hadsome. 
НЕДРУГ: Let's show 'em. 
РОСС: OK dad. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining... no. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off? 
МОНИКА: I can't believe you did that. 
РОСС: Yeah, well. 
ФИБИ: See, he's her lobster. 
МОНИКА: Nooooo. You’re really not going? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s, Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour. 
МОНИКА: You don’t have a car. And your license expired. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It’s almost as good as being there." 
ДЖОУИ: It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, You could, but... probably just the one time. 
ДЖОУИ: I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
