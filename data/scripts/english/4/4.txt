ФИБИ: Hey! New wallet, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn t say cool anymore.
МОНИКА: Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
МОНИКА: Have you ever taken out the trash?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I thought you liked doing it.
МОНИКА: Third door on the left.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ummm. Oh! I m sorry. It s a little old but.
НЕДРУГ: No! You re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I m sorry. I didn t, I don t come in here a lot.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, of course you don t!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Cause you re a little princess! Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn t. I never said that.
НЕДРУГ: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don t think of someone else for a change?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I m sorry.
МОНИКА: God! If you re gonna cry about it! She grabs the box and goes to through it out.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
ДЖОУИ: I m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
МОНИКА: Joey, please don t do that. I think it s best that we just forget about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That s easy for you to say, you weren t almost just killed.
ДЖОУИ: All right that s it, school is in session!
МОНИКА: My God! Is this a gym card?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I ve missed the last 1200 times.
РОСС: So why don t you quit?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don t think I ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
РОСС: Who is Maria?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh Maria. You can t say no to her, she s like this lycra spandex covered gym treat.
РОСС: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
РОСС: So you re strong enough to face her on your own?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, you ll have to come.
НЕДРУГ: Tribbiani! Hold on, I ll get the plunger.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
НЕДРУГ: And tell him what?
ДЖОУИ: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
ДЖОУИ: I have actually not heard of that.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don t need this grief. I m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting her grandmother s apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
ДЖОУИ: Why don t you tell me something I don t know! He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey mouths Oops!
ФИБИ: Oh please, somebody tell me I don t have to go to work today!
МОНИКА: What s the matter?
ФИБИ: Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I m not allowed to charge for.
МОНИКА: So do them for free.
ФИБИ: Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it s against my oath as a masseuse.
РОСС: They make you take an oath?
ФИБИ: No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why don t you just give him to somebody else?
ФИБИ: No, I can handle it. No, I m a professional.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
МОНИКА: Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because that s the only part of you he can see when he s on the table!
МОНИКА: You re gonna do some feet flirtin!
ФИБИ: I don t know what your talking about.
РОСС: Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
ФИБИ: Because it s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! My hero! What happened?
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he d better come up here and apologize. I ll see you later.
МОНИКА: What a minute, what did he say?
ДЖОУИ: He said that he wasn t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he s gonna do is have you evicted! I ll see you later.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! You got us evicted!
МОНИКА: I told you not to go down there!
ДЖОУИ: Well he made Rachel cry!
МОНИКА: Rachel always cries!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That s not true!
МОНИКА: Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you ve never sucked before!
ДЖОУИ: All right! I ll try! But if I can t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go!
ДЖОУИ: All right, all right, all right. I mean I ll have to check with him first, but I ll think he ll be cool with it.
РОСС: Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Yes!
РОСС: One more time, Hey, don t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
РОСС: Good! That s good!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
НЕДРУГ: You wanna quit?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wanna quit the gym.
НЕДРУГ: You do realize that you won t have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wanna quit the gym.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. Uh, excuse me, are you a member?
РОСС: Me? No.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, members only.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wanna quit the gym.
РОСС: It s okay man, be strong.
НЕДРУГ: So, are you a member of any gym.
РОСС: No! And I m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I m Maria.
НЕДРУГ: Wow, you have really pretty feet.
ФИБИ: These old things.
НЕДРУГ: Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it s been killing me today.
ФИБИ: You mean the. Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Ow! Did you just bite me?
ФИБИ: No!
НЕДРУГ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Please don t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn t their fault, it was mine.
НЕДРУГ: You want me to kick you guys out instead?
ДЖОУИ: No you can t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
НЕДРУГ: You have pets!
ДЖОУИ: Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I m the chick and Chandler is the duck.
НЕДРУГ: Huh, I would ve thought it was the other way around.
ДЖОУИ: Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I ll do whatever you want.
НЕДРУГ: Really? You ll do anything?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I ve got something you can do.
ДЖОУИ: What, what is it?
НЕДРУГ: Can you be my dancing partner?
ДЖОУИ: That s not, prison lingo, is it?
МОНИКА: His dancing partner?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, there s this superintendent s dance, the Super Ball. I don t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he has a crush on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, why doesn t he practice with a girl?
ДЖОУИ: Well, he s too shy, he doesn t think he s good enough to dance with girls yet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that garbage chute.
МОНИКА: Oh, would you let it go already?! You re fine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! So, did you quit?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I almost did, couldn t leave Ross there without a spotter!
МОНИКА: Wait, now so you joined the gym?
РОСС: And that s funny, why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, umm, I was just y know working out and umm, Oh, that s it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We re doomed. Okay, they re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
МОНИКА: Well, you could actually go to the gym.
РОСС: Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You re a genius!
ДЖОУИ: Aww, man, now we won t be bank buddies!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, there s two reasons.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where?!
ФИБИ: On the touchy.
РОСС: And that s not against your oath?!
ФИБИ: No, I know! II m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.

НЕДРУГ: Oh really? Well, then you d better tell his other wife, cause she called three times asking where he is.
ФИБИ: Yes, I will tell her.
МОНИКА: So you didn t leave the bank?
РОСС: No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you ever gonna use that for?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To pay for the gym.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
