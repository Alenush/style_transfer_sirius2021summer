ДЖОУИ: Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away! 
ДЖОУИ: Huh?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could we be more white trash? 
МОНИКА: How desperate am I? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game. 
МОНИКА: I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her. 
ФИБИ: How come? 
МОНИКА: Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect. 
РОСС: Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do. 
МОНИКА: You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice? 
ДЖОУИ: Just pickle. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello, Rachel. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, not at first. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is she doing here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’ 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I promise, I’ll end it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant. 
НЕДРУГ: How’s the hired help? 
МОНИКА: Doing great, the quiches are coming along. 
НЕДРУГ: What’s this? Blue nail polish? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I thought it was cute. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her. 
МОНИКА: Let me ask you a question. 
НЕДРУГ: Hmm. 
МОНИКА: Why did you hire me? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I didn’t hear that. 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good. 
ФИБИ: Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! 
НЕДРУГ: Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhhhh. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? 
ДЖОУИ: No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there. 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you’re not really sure what they’re talking about? 
РОСС: I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, I totally agree. 
МОНИКА: I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. 
НЕДРУГ: Nooo!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was like the Algonquin kids table. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in. 
ФИБИ: That’s weird. 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: Your nails. 
МОНИКА: Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them. 
ФИБИ: Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God! 
ФИБИ: Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat that’s the problem. 
НЕДРУГ: Honey, don’t bite your nails. 
МОНИКА: Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one. 
ФИБИ: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m not freaking out. 
МОНИКА: Then why are you laughing? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars. 
МОНИКА: What? You bet I’d lose a nail? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d need these. . 
МОНИКА: Frozen lasagnas? 
НЕДРУГ: Um-hmm. 
МОНИКА: You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was. 
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica. 
МОНИКА: You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself. 
МОНИКА: That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. 
ФИБИ: I don’t get it. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I have faith. 
МОНИКА: No! You have lasagnas! 
НЕДРУГ: Ding! 
ФИБИ: Op, the ruined quiches are ready. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It just doesn’t feel like we’re breaking up. 
НЕДРУГ: No, we are. I’m sad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow? All right. Unbelievable!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, that was my boss. I have to go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m getting dressed. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait. I wanna show you something. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is it? 
НЕДРУГ: Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. Put your hands together. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll be back in ten minutes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are, you’re gonna leave me like this? 
НЕДРУГ: Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! I brought you back a macaroon! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s weird, she locked the door. 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! How are you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello, Joanna ’s office. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How little?! 
НЕДРУГ: A couple of hours, I feel awful. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now! 
НЕДРУГ: I can’t!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not?! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m in my boss’s car! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh, tunnel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rachel, could I see you for a moment? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You promised you would break up with her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Never! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You never come into this office again! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You give me back my Walkman! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I never borrowed your Walkman. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then I lost it. You buy me one! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Does it hurt? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: About what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, this is much better. 
НЕДРУГ: So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh? 
ДЖОУИ: He cut off his ear. 
НЕДРУГ: And? 
ДЖОУИ: I’m out. 
НЕДРУГ: He painted that. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there? 
НЕДРУГ: Let’s see, ahhh Where does the Pope live? 
ДЖОУИ: In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer. 
НЕДРУГ: Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber? 
ДЖОУИ: Spock’s birth control. 
НЕДРУГ: You need these books. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
ФИБИ: This used to be your room? Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change. 
ФИБИ: Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica. 
МОНИКА: Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on. 
ФИБИ: No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica. 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change. 
МОНИКА: All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make. 
ФИБИ: Wow! My breasts are really strong. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What if I clean your bathroom for a month? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It still wouldn’t be clean. All I want is my freedom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Foot rubs for a month! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Freedom! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sophie sit!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! God, would you just calm down! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. In a minute. 
НЕДРУГ: So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book! 
ДЖОУИ: Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’. 
НЕДРУГ: Well ah, what can you swing? 
ДЖОУИ: How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time? 
НЕДРУГ: You don’t have, anything? 
ДЖОУИ: You wanna see what I got? Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time. 
ДЖОУИ: And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants. 
НЕДРУГ: For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I ah Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: With extra pulp? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: D’oh!! I’ve got it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don’t have it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do Monica and Phoebe know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Go on. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And Milton Berle has a 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, not compared to you. 
МОНИКА: Well? 
ФИБИ: They’re not even touching the lasagna! 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
ФИБИ: Oh, they love your casserole. 
МОНИКА: Yes!! 
ФИБИ: It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish. 
МОНИКА: And you? 
НЕДРУГ: I thought it was quite tasty. 
МОНИКА: So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you.... 
НЕДРУГ: A bitch? 
МОНИКА: Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today. 
МОНИКА: Wow! 
ФИБИ: Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn’t know we switched it. 
НЕДРУГ: And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer. 
МОНИКА: That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hello, Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you. 
ДЖОУИ: Wh-what’s going on? 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
ДЖОУИ: No he doesn’t! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Two hours, that lasted! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So did you break up with Joanna? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think so. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius. 
РОСС: The volcano? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant. 
МОНИКА: Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War? 
МОНИКА: Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country. 
РОСС: With such a sad history. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could there be more Kims? 
НЕДРУГ: Who’s out there? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s me! Good morning! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I Oh my word! 
НЕДРУГ: I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah! Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definately broken up this time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
