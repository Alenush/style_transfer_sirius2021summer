НЕДРУГ: Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don't really know what happened with that. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm your mother. 
ФИБИ: Ehh? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi there. 
ДЖОУИ: ...and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either... 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. 
РОСС: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned. 
РОСС: Awww. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks a million. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you're welcome a million. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'll see you in our room. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
РОСС: I know. 
РОСС: Okay, I gotta go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! What?! Why?! 
РОСС: Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here?! Now?! 
РОСС: Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood? 
РОСС: No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa-ho. 
РОСС: Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know. 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, making it worse! 
РОСС: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened. 
ФИБИ: I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off! 
НЕДРУГ: Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close. 
ФИБИ: How close? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple. 
ФИБИ: I don't even know how that would work! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, we were... 
ФИБИ: I'm not asking! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait! 
ФИБИ: I don't ever want to see you again! 
ФИБИ: Umm, where's my purse? 
МОНИКА: Shoot! We're out of soda. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'll go out and get you some. 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go? 
ФИБИ: Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I found a dried up seashores. 
МОНИКА: Sweety, what are you talking about? 
ФИБИ: Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it? 
ФИБИ: No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone. 
ФИБИ: Monica! 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
РОСС: It's over. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, was it awful? 
РОСС: Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wrote you a letter. 
РОСС: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. 
РОСС: Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done. 
РОСС: Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting. 
РОСС: Oh. Oh-oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up? 
РОСС: Done! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You just finished? 
РОСС: Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So umm, does it? 
РОСС: I'm sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Does it? 
РОСС: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it... 
РОСС: No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you sure? 
РОСС: Oh, sure! I'm sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? 
МОНИКА: Ennnh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've got canned goods. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excellent hole, Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no! No!! My hole!! 
МОНИКА: Ow!! Ow!!! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! What?!! What is it?! 
МОНИКА: Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?! 
МОНИКА: It's like two miles! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole. 
МОНИКА: Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We've got to do something! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, there's really only one thing you can do. 
МОНИКА: What?! What is it?! 
ДЖОУИ: You're gonna have to pee on it. 
МОНИКА: What?!! Gross!! 
ДЖОУИ: Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain. 
МОНИКА: Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: If you want some privacy you can use my hole. 
ФИБИ: Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh. 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How was the beach? 
МОНИКА: Nothing, I don't know. 
РОСС: What happened? 
МОНИКА: Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me too!! 
ДЖОУИ: Me too. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does? 
РОСС: It does. It really and truly does. 
РОСС: It so does not!!! 
РОСС: She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you! 
РОСС: Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, If you accept full responsibility... Full responsibility! ...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!! 
ДЖОУИ: No? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. 
РОСС: Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about. 
РОСС: What the hell happened on that beach?! 
ДЖОУИ: It's between us and the sea, Ross! 
ФИБИ: Hi, Ursula. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom. 
НЕДРУГ: Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm. 
ФИБИ: You know her?! 
НЕДРУГ: No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note. 
ФИБИ: There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it? 
НЕДРУГ: Hang on. 
ФИБИ: I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. So how have you been doing? 
ФИБИ: I, umm, shut up! 
ФИБИ: Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right? 
ФИБИ: Noooo!! 
НЕДРУГ: All right, hang on! 
МОНИКА: Pass the cheese, please. 
МОНИКА: My God, you can't even look at me! Can you? 
ДЖОУИ: Nope. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!! 
ФИБИ: No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us. 
РОСС: Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing? 
НЕДРУГ: NO!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there? 
МОНИКА: What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on! 
РОСС: What happened? Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: All right. 
МОНИКА: No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They'll never understand! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish. 
МОНИКА: All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it. 
МОНИКА: I was in too much pain. 
ДЖОУИ: And I was tired from digging the huge hole! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And then Joey remembered something. 
ДЖОУИ: I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel... 
РОСС: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?! 
НЕДРУГ: Ewwww!! 
МОНИКА: You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... 
НЕДРУГ: Ewwww!! 
ДЖОУИ: That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming. 
ДЖОУИ: That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out. 
ФИБИ: ...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm. Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up. 
ФИБИ: Okay, bye. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here? 
ФИБИ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done. 
ФИБИ: But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I guess you're right. 
ФИБИ: It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza. 
ФИБИ: I-I like pizza! 
НЕДРУГ: You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, so do I! 
НЕДРУГ: I knew it, wow!! 
ФИБИ: Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly? 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, so cute. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you. 
НЕДРУГ: I know. I'm mad at me too. 
ФИБИ: Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Me too! 
ФИБИ: All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-hooo, I missed you. 
РОСС: I missed you too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? 
РОСС: I suppose. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater. 
РОСС: Umm-hmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective... 
РОСС: WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Coffee house? 
МОНИКА: You bet. 
РОСС: And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! 
РОСС: I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!! 
РОСС: I fell asleep! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You fell asleep?! 
РОСС: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!' 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! 
РОСС: FINE BY ME!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!! 
МОНИКА: Hey!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me! 
РОСС: Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I KNEW IT!!!! 
МОНИКА: Gin. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked. 
МОНИКА: Will you stop! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. All right. 
МОНИКА: Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
