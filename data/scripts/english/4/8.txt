ДЖОУИ: Hello.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I.
ДЖОУИ: Hello.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm.
ДЖОУИ: Stop callin'!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, KRock for our 1,000 daily challenge.
ДЖОУИ: All right!
НЕДРУГ: What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
ФИБИ: Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So are things with you and Joey any better?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
РОСС: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You shouldn't.
ФИБИ: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
РОСС: Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
МОНИКА: We haven't eaten yet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
ФИБИ: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
ФИБИ: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it. Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R. G. put on it. Her initials.
ФИБИ: Ohh.
МОНИКА: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
МОНИКА: Who cares? He works in a museum!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
ФИБИ: You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks.
МОНИКА: What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!
ФИБИ: God, what happened?!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: People are trying to sleep in here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
ФИБИ: Open it up, let me see.
МОНИКА: Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
ФИБИ: Ooh, God it looks bad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
МОНИКА: No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's really picky about his patients.
ФИБИ: Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
МОНИКА: Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
ФИБИ: Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
МОНИКА: Yes!
ФИБИ: Yes! She's very excited about that.
ФИБИ: This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
РОСС: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
ФИБИ: Okay, get out of my kitchen!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
ФИБИ: All right I. I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
РОСС: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
РОСС: Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know R. G, I was thinking something girlie for your office.
РОСС: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
РОСС: Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like?
РОСС: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When was the last time you saw her wear it?
РОСС: Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Big dog?
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
РОСС: Everything? Even the TV?
ДЖОУИ: No! I'm putting that in my room.
РОСС: Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
ДЖОУИ: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
РОСС: That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
ДЖОУИ: Five years.
РОСС: You've sentenced him?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
РОСС: Joey, the guy's your best friend.
ДЖОУИ: No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
РОСС: Oh, who? Me?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, is it really that bad?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe.
НЕДРУГ: I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Burke will see you know.
МОНИКА: Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
НЕДРУГ: Ready?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! I'm sorry! That, where are you going?
ДЖОУИ: My folks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
ДЖОУИ: Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I justI just screwed up!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
ДЖОУИ: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
ДЖОУИ: We've got a box.
НЕДРУГ: Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
МОНИКА: I was probably waiting for it to open.
НЕДРУГ: I gotta tell you, you look great now.
МОНИКА: You look great too.
НЕДРУГ: You're an excellent patient!
МОНИКА: So how does it look?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
МОНИКА: Like a pirate?!
НЕДРУГ: If that helps you.
МОНИКА: Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
НЕДРУГ: I moved back here a couple of months ago.
МОНИКА: Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
НЕДРУГ: Uh.
МОНИКА: No way!
НЕДРУГ: I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
МОНИКА: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: But we broke up.
МОНИКА: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
МОНИКА: Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
НЕДРУГ: You're not wearing the patch yet.
МОНИКА: I know.
РОСС: He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, it's sick.
МОНИКА: Why is it sick?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
МОНИКА: Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: What's twisted?
МОНИКА: Me going out with Richard's son.
ДЖОУИ: Ewwwww! Ew! Ew! Ew!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is he okay in there?
ДЖОУИ: He's fine!
РОСС: Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
МОНИКА: Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
ДЖОУИ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The meaning of the box is three fold. One, it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three, it hurts!
РОСС: Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?
РОСС: I just wanna check something.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Now, we'll see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Air hole! Air hole!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
РОСС: The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
РОСС: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
РОСС: What did you get?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Credit.
МОНИКА: I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
МОНИКА: Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, nice to meet you.
МОНИКА: And Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Joey.
МОНИКА: My brother, Ross.
РОСС: Hey.
МОНИКА: And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do ya do.
НЕДРУГ: What's.
МОНИКА: Umm, well, he's.
ДЖОУИ: He's doin' some thinkin'!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened? What happened?!
ДЖОУИ: You kissed my girlfriend!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
РОСС: Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
МОНИКА: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
НЕДРУГ: Where can I wash up?
МОНИКА: Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
МОНИКА: See he's nice. Right?
ФИБИ: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, That's not how your dad used to do it.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
МОНИКА: I saved you a seat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sick-sick-sick-sick.
ФИБИ: Oh, I'll get it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gotcha!
ДЖОУИ: That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry!
ДЖОУИ: Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay, you got it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, can you pass me the yams?
РОСС: Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
МОНИКА: Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
РОСС: There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, fine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
ДЖОУИ: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
ДЖОУИ: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Absolutely!
ДЖОУИ: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
РОСС: I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
МОНИКА: Ooh, this always happens.
НЕДРУГ: Here, let me help.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: You-you have a very beautiful eye.
МОНИКА: Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know II thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
МОНИКА: I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I totally agree.
МОНИКА: We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Nothing. Nothing.
НЕДРУГ: No-no really, was-was that not okay?
МОНИКА: No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a good kiss.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! It didn't remind you of.
МОНИКА: Don't say it!
НЕДРУГ: No, but it did! Didn't it?!
МОНИКА: Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Oh man!
МОНИКА: I know!
ДЖОУИ: I'll get it.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am.
ДЖОУИ: That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
ДЖОУИ: In the box.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
ФИБИ: Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
НЕДРУГ: Why not? What's going on?
ФИБИ: He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
НЕДРУГ: By being in a box?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, had reasons.
ФИБИ: They were threefold.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm. Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: Open the box!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ДЖОУИ: He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, this is.
ДЖОУИ: Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
ДЖОУИ: All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, he sees her!
МОНИКА: Oh, he's catching up to her!
ФИБИ: Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
РОСС: He's taking her purse!
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
ФИБИ: Oh, there they are!
ФИБИ: All right, get a room.
