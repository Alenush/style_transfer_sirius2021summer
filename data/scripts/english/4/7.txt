ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture! 
РОСС: Y'know if we ever go to war and you`re captured, you`re in for a big surprise. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it`s bad enough that I`m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we`re in the room together there`s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I`ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she` s smooth! Smooth! 
ФИБИ: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Here you go. 
ДЖОУИ: Great! All right, so I`ll call you later. 
НЕДРУГ: Great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that? 
ДЖОУИ: That would be Casey. We`re going out tonight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Goin` out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn`t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer. 
ДЖОУИ: No, things are fine with Kathy. I`m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait! You`re going out with Kathy! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I`m upset...for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. 
ДЖОУИ: What is the big deal? It`s not like we`re exclusive. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she`s-she`s smart, and funny, and gets you. 
ДЖОУИ: You got all that from the back of her head? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, I think it`s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane. 
ДЖОУИ: Who`s Elaine? 
ФИБИ: "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don`t know who to get to the next verse. 
РОСС: Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about bah-bah-bha-bhan? 
РОСС: Well umm, y`know, I used to play. 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, that`s right, the keyboards, huh? 
РОСС: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that`s-that`s when I really found my sound. 
МОНИКА: Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound." 
ФИБИ: I wanna hear "The Sound." 
РОСС: Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven`t played in so long, and-and, well it`s-it`s really personal stuff, y`know? 
ФИБИ: Come on, play that funky music white boy. 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
РОСС: No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in.. No, yeah, okay. 
РОСС: Okay, guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Bring it on, you... 
РОСС: Here we go. Y`know, I`ve-I`ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it`s important that-that you understand it`s about communicating very private emotions. Y`know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That`s what I..... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! Play! 
МОНИКА: Boy, that was-that was, umm=85 terrific. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really, bitchin`! 
ФИБИ: Wow, it was so....wow! 
РОСС: Really?! I mean, really?!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I mean, you should play in public! 
РОСС: Wow! Thanks, you guys. That`s uh, ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I`ll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I`m I am so.... 
МОНИКА: Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I can`t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers. 
ФИБИ: What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it`s just, it`s so different from the stuff you usually hear. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean like, music? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know what you`re thinkin`! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come in! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Oh God, is that Baywatch? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles. 
НЕДРУГ: So is Joey around? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, he`s not back yet, but he`ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern? 
НЕДРУГ: I uh, don`t really have a preference. You? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I like it in the stern. of the boat. Hello. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it`s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened? 
ДЖОУИ: We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I`ll be there as soon as I can. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why can`t you tell her? 
ДЖОУИ: `Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey! Joey!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought your time ran out. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, that was Joey. He`s running a little late, he says he`s sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I guess it`s just uh, you and me then. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I think it is! 
НЕДРУГ: So what did you do today? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut.... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it looks great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ...and then it got canceled. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I could cut it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! You do that? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt`s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don`t make my tail too poofy. 
НЕДРУГ: You have really great hair. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y`know who also has great hair is Joey! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I`m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What-what `cha doin`? 
НЕДРУГ: Checking to see if it`s even. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: `Kay. 
НЕДРУГ: Looks good. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh the phone! The phone`s making sounds! Hello! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey dude, it`s me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey it`s Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Listen uh, I`m really sorry, it looks like I`m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn`t there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it must`ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah man. Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Oh no it`s fine, don`t worry about it. Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it`s okay. Yeah! I`ll talk to you tomorrow. I should uh, probably go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Yes! Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: I forgot my purse. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I really did forget my purse. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no, this is bad! It`s bad! This is bad! 
НЕДРУГ: Horrible! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation? 
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, the kiss was good. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
НЕДРУГ: No, but that`s bad! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here`s what we do, we-we forget it happened. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we`re unhappy forever. Sound good? 
НЕДРУГ: Can you really do that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have to; he`s my best friend, and you`re seeing him. 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-no-no-no! Don`t! Don`t! See-see, you`re getting me confused, I`m starting to urn. 
НЕДРУГ: I`m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I-I think we have too. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Bye. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye. Are you still out there? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РОСС: Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time... 
МОНИКА: Y'know, there`s a Starbucks about three blocks down. 
ФИБИ: It`s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go! 
РОСС: Thank you guys-guys-guys.... 
МОНИКА: Hey, aren`t you up next? 
ФИБИ: Oh no, I`m not playing tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why not? 
ФИБИ: I can`t follow Ross! It`d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, Ross sucks! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, he`s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time! 
МОНИКА: Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Phoebe you`re awful! 
ФИБИ: You guys. You suck too. 
ДЖОУИ: Aww man! I can`t believe I locked myself out again! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hang on buddy! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I sure did. 
ДЖОУИ: Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I just thought it`d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you`re amazing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. 
ДЖОУИ: A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That`s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y`know I`m 29. I mean who needs a savings account. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I don`t know. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I`m gonna do that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean with Casey. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, I think I`m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She`s pretty cool. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or Casey. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no, Kathy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could be Casey. 
ДЖОУИ: No. No, Kathy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Consider Casey. 
ДЖОУИ: Y`know what I think? I think somebody`s got a little crush on Casey. How `bout I fix you two up? What do you think? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great! 
РОСС: Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don`t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true? 
ФИБИ: Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah. 
РОСС: Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I-I can`t I mean y`know I was trying to be really ya know okay and upbeat about it, I just, I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I.... 
РОСС: See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y`know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won`t play anymore. 
ФИБИ: Oh no. No-no-no, don`t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music. 
РОСС: Yeah, okay. 
РОСС: Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice. 
МОНИКА: Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I kissed Kathy. 
РОСС: What? 
МОНИКА: Are you serious? 
ФИБИ: Does Joey know? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he`ll understand this? 
МОНИКА: You obviously haven`t screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate. 
РОСС: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would`ve just stepped aside. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, don`t say that! Don`t say that. That`s not true. Is it? 
ФИБИ: I think maybe, yeah. 
МОНИКА: He loves you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then why didn`t you tell me to do that?!! 
РОСС: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! No, that`s right. And I thought it was a really good idea. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I remember that! 
МОНИКА: I remember you did. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God!! What am I gonna do?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Chandler, you`re gonna have to tell him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?! Why do I have to tell him?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because you do. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I know. 
РОСС: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that a real thing? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something. 
ДЖОУИ: What`s up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It`s-it`s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually. 
ДЖОУИ: You do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you`re timing couldn`t be better. She`s not my girlfriend anymore. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, she broke up with me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh uh, when? 
ДЖОУИ: Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that`s why I let people watch. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I`ve been better. But, I`m all right. So you like her huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but I-I uh, don`t have too. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, no it`s uh, it`s okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. You know why? `Cause you can to me first. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do. 
ДЖОУИ: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you`re work cut out for you. `Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she`s into some other guy. So... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See uh, that`s-that`s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is. 
ДЖОУИ: Who? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It`s me. I`m the other guy. 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and... 
ДЖОУИ: And what?! Did you sleep with her?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! No! I just kissed her. 
ДЖОУИ: What?!! That`s even worse!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How is that worse?! 
ДЖОУИ: I don`t know! But it`s the same! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I`m sorry! But there`s nothing I can do, I think I`m in love with her! 
ДЖОУИ: Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You`re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line. 
ДЖОУИ: Over the line?! You-you`re-you`re so far past the line, that you-you can`t even see the line! The line is a dot to you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me! 
ДЖОУИ: Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y`know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there`s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I`m not gonna eat! You know why?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Probably because.... 
ДЖОУИ: Because it`s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I`m not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, he`s lost it. He`s totally lost it. 
МОНИКА: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves. 
РОСС: Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y`know, I`m not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set? 
ФИБИ: After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help. 
РОСС: Yeah, like I could lose it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: I played bad on purpose guys. 
МОНИКА: Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time. 
РОСС: Yeah, no, just that last song.
