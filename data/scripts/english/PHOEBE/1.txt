Wait, does he eat chalk? Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh! No. Ooh! Oh! Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, ..bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la... I helped! Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good. Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to. All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. I can't believe what I'm hearing here... What I said... Oh, was I doing it again? Hi guys! Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!' Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'. Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing. Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not- mine'... Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt. Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' Hey, Lizzie. I brought you alphabet soup. Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? I know. No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. Oh, that's fine, no. No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? Okay. No, I'm fine. Huh! I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! Does, um, anyone wanna see? Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?! Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. There it is! You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- Did he mention us? If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! Oh! What what what! ...Hi. I got no sleep last night! My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! Thanks. I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? Look, look, I have elbows! Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! You are just like Jack. No, Jack and the Beanstalk. Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.. Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. Floopy? Oh, like that's a word. Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question. What? I don't even have a 'pl'. And-and a power tie? Big Bird's friend. Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman. Definitely not his mother. Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch! Yeah? Uh-huh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. You'd already broken up. A couple hours. There he is! There he is! Right- where we've been looking all night! The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud! Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys. Based on this play? ...Based on this play! No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line. Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy? I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Seriously, what-what's the part? No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'. Thanks. Hi, erm I want to start with a song that`s about that moment when you suddenly realise. . . . what life is really all about. OK, here we go. OK thank you very much.

Ooh, this poor little tuti is scared to death! We should find his owner. Oh. Well, he seems to hate you, are you sure? Well, er, wait a minute, what`s his name? Ooo, ..ahh, you are a very BAD man! Alright, I looked all over the building and I couldn`t find the kitty anywhere. Ahh, well, there ya go, last to know again, and I`m guessing since no body told me this is Paolo. Hi. You bet ya! Oh I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip, But I won`t. Ya know, did you rent mopeds..because I`ve heard.. Oh It`s not about that right now, ok. Oh look, look, look, the last candle is about to burn out. Ten.nine.eight.seven. minus forty six, minus forty seven, minus forty eight.. Yeah, I think so, yeah. I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny... Yeah, you have homosexual hair. Oh, that sucks! Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone. Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her. Thanks! Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings. What'd I say? God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!

Why don't we invite her? Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally believe everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious. Look out, incoming pumpkin pie! Ok, all done. Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. Almost never. Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean. Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys. Ooh. Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal. It's nice that he has someone. Ooh, you guys have to make a wish. Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for? That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. Yeah, you wish! Oh, oh, good. Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.   Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! Could you speak up please? Okay, we're gonna take a short break. David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical. Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just? Okay, alright, I have a question, then. Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? Sure. Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella.

And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'. Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me. And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy. Everybody looks so happy. I hate that. I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight. Do you think they have yesterday's daily news? Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right. Where? Ooh, come to Momma. We should do something. Whistle. Come on, do it. Do it! Do it do it do it! I can't believe you did that! I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP! Maybe nobody's tried this. Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic. Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked. I know. Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible. Hey hey hey! She's on! Your mom was arrested? What about Glen? He could be a Glen. Ooh! How about Agamemnon? I'm in. Hi.

I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay. Alright, whadyou do with him? Look at you! How, how do you feel? I'm Phoebe Buffay. Well, we both have. Well, actually it's just from me. You know who shaved you? That was me. I sang. Hah! You're welcome. What, that's it? I don't think you mean that. Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma. Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. Sorry. Woo-hoo, first weekend away together! Ok, thanks. Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here? Well, Racquela's right, yeah! Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started. Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked! Fine! Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts. All right, you know Paolo? Well, he made a move on me. He made a move on me. Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. Uma Thurman. She is gonna hate me. Hey! Are you moving out? Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec? Oh! Ok, um, ok, um, Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. I know. Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies Which proves that I never lie. Paolo made a pass at me. Are you okay? Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better? I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on! No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about? Such a pig! Oh he's like a... ...like a... Yes, good! Ok... Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you... The end. Should I not have told you? I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...we should get over there and see if she's okay. Ooh! Oh, ok bye-bye. Oh, just look at her... You ok? Yep! Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson. Morly Safer. The woman who cuts my hair! Oh, really. Riff's. Yeah, I know. Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat? Where were you standing? It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new"? Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why? Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not? Yeah I'm fine. Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me. Ooh! Bath salts would be nice. Yeah? Right, and it's me. Much as you are. Oh, that's good. Good choice. Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really-- Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits. That you like. We get it. You like her. Great. All right, well, maybe now it's not ok. Ok. Where're you going? With? All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know...like, you know, you know, yet? All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it--make them go away? I can't, I can't look. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing. Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but-- Yeah. But he's falling in love with her. Ok. Oh, ok, oh. Hey, what's going on? Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey? Hi. Trouble? Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you? Hey. Um, you, got a minute? So. Um, oh, I got you a birthday present. Right, like the kind you-- How'd you know I was coming? I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this. Does he know? Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you. You got me. So, um, are you gonna call him? No. Joey. No. No food with a face. Yeah, you too. Hey. Listen, um. I'm sorry. Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk. Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work. If it was, would you stop hanging out with her? Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me. You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over. Really? Yeah. Is he all right? Y quien pidio el pollo General Tso? Oh, it was so good. I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, you know, like guns and bombs and like buses going really fast. Hey, hi. Whoa, oh, why is the air in here so negative? Oh no, how? Which one? No. Which one? The right or left? Cos the left one is lucky... Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? OK. Thank you Mr.Heckles Oh, is that who the monkey's named after? Oh my god. You'd put that poor little creature in jail? Yes, but there isn't always time... Dun, dun, dun... Sorry. Marcel? Oh my god! . Something just brushed up against my right leg! Oh, oh. It's OK! It was just my left leg. Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel, come here. Oh come here Marcel... Yes, huh, I think so. I just... Oh! ... Huh!... Whoa! Oh. This is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea! No. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my butt cheek is waking up! Oh! Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! Hey. What are you doing? This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONICA, DON'T DO IT!! ...Thank you. Lotsa things. I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. I'm totally getting it! Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. Hey. We found her, we found the girl. Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke. I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. ...Flame Boy. Okay. Goodbye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the 'plane. Oh! Tell him, tell him. Doing it on this table. Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press? Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients. No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop". And they are. What... I could, I could do it. What is it? I could be a secretary. I could do that. Well, maybe 25-26. There you go. Yeah? Oh. Uh, I'm on. Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now. Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye. Ross says hi. This is so fun. All right, what do we do now? Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there. All right. Bye bye. Whatcha doin'? Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice. No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you. Oh, because, you know... they don't like you. I thought you knew that. Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone. Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing". Yeah, yeah. They even do you. You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?' That is so sweet, you guys. Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool! Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people. No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance. Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are. I really do, yeah. Okay. Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss. You were great. But they still made fun of you. You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss", "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss", "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing" Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss. Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore. No, but you can't. Uh uh. Petrie. Did I miss it, did I miss it? I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical. They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry... Thanks, Ross. Ok. Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress. Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...la la la la la la. This is so great. I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting. Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben to the rescue. Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. You guys, he's beautiful! Susan, he looks just like you. Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes. Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
