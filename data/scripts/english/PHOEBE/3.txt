Hello. Thank you! I know, though. Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny. All right all ready. We could not, would not want to wait. I don't know, you might be the first one. "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky? Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys! What am I gonna do? Monica, Monica, you know what gets out humus. Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that. Humus. I got the humus. That won't go with this dress though. Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place. Monica, you don't know that. Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi! Okay, I'm ready. Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.' Duh!! Christmas! Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys? Definitely. I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. Okay, we're on it. We're on it. Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed. Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out. Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no! How did you do that? Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself. Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you. What? Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously. Oh, you're not a dingus. Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay. Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying? Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay. Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee? Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more. Hi! Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today. Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order. Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute. No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her. Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather. Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going. Oh, yeah. What's this? Um, not even a little bit. Oh, okay then. Good. So what were you thinking? Really? Oh. Oh, okay. Hellooo! Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'. Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me. Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? What are you saying I should do? Thank you, Monica. Yes? Yes! Oh. Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister. Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train? No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch. Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go? Oh, oh! It's on again! Hey. Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me! Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play. That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault. What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh . No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.' 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.' 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen. Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again? 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.' 'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel. It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before. Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time. Two? Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right Helloo! Oh! No it's not, sorry. Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants. Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit. Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent. Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I... Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah. Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial. No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that. Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb'. Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.' Oh. Yeah, no, I understand. Yeah. Sorry. What? Oh, you caught me. I am so busted. Hey! No, but he's always late. Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.' No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me. Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank. This is everybody. This is Ross. Chandler. Joey. This is Monica. And this is Rachel. I'm gonna get coffee. Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything. Oh, ew! Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad. Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that.... Feburary 16th. Wow, that's close. When's yours? That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home? Okay so, by melting, you meant melting. So is it like art? Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom? Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache. G'night, bro. Here. Y'know, just in case. No kind. He just makes it up. So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and.... Ah!! Oh, how do you play the shadow game? I just asked you. I don't have time for this. Which you just gave up really quickly. Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly. Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um. Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff. Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah! All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me? No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for? No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited? Hey!-Hey! What's going on? You can't have sex with her! Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes. So that's what you thought I did! God! That's not what I do! Nooo! Why would you think that? Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways. You really thought it was perfect? Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you? I don't.... Right, okay, um-mm. Yeah, I guess I do, yeah. Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know. Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this. Uh-huh. She wasn't a hooker. Maybe all the rulers are wrong. Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem. Oh, that is so unfortunate. Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight. You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone. Bye-bye! That’s why I moved out. I think on some levels she already knows. Okay, well maybe not on those levels. Why, nobody good? Oh, really? So what are they doing? Hey, you’re early. I’m just taking it to be re-wired. No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. You don’t play the oboe! Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. Huh? It’s not in the apartment? Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again. Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore. I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows! That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side. Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill. Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening. Aww, good. What? No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is. Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong? Oh no! Why? Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny. Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover? I’m sorry. Aw, God Ross. Oh. I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. And you’re so sweet. And you’re kind Huh? Okay, it’s okay. Oh. What? What? Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear. What? You have chalk on your face. Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass. Who's singing? Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King! Hey! Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God! Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler. Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo! Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends. Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night? Ooooh, nice. Oh, yay! Oh. Okay. Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there. Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler. Is that a problem? Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on. Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough. Oh! Oh! Oh! Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it. 'Kay, put your head back. All right, I have ya. Oh God. Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay. I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? I am soo dead. Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom! I know, you must've won like a contest or something! I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it... When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open! It's Monica's bed. What? So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you? Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay. No, no, it's just my tooth. No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him. Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'. Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead. Ow! Ow! All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set. Although, don't feel like you can't visit. Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him. Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um...... No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive! Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know. 'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!' Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone! Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive. What? Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big. I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick. He's alive! He's a-live!!! 'Love....' 'I know.' 'I've found....' Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. . Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever. Yay!! Okay, so how do we decide that? Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle. Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler? Yeah. What's block? I thought you meant in life. Go! Go! Go! Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow! Touchdown!! Touchdown!! Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So? Oh my God! Woo-yay!! I love this game!! Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?! All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys? Come on Mon, let her throw the ball. Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah. Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going. Isn't there a national football league. Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some? Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now. No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night? Really? Hey. Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh... Destiny. Yes. Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled. You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist. So, what happens to the old guys? Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh. All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard. Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that. This is the worst Christmas ever. Oh! Oh my God! You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best! Oh, God bless us, everyone. Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?' Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down. Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... . Oh, thank you. Well, he's very charming. Well, you're just gonna have to try. Hey! Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice. Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you. Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. Why, what happened? How can you not know which one? We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha! Oh well y'know. Ick, you were eavesdropping. Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me. Thanks you guys! Thank you. God, I hope they kick his ass! Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich'. Why don't you get a magician?! Well, can you dance at all? What, what is that? Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? Oh yeah. Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! Hey! What are you wrapping? Yeah, it's a vase. Well not exactly like the one in the poem. Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. Hi. Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff. I'm going to let him. Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger. Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed. I'll have coffee. Hey! Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer. Oh, I get more because I'm dainty. Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter? What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?! You guys!! Come on! What do you mean? Hey. Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down! Yeah. And, first here's a gift. That's all right, that's well, I figured.... Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him? Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?' Hey. No, I can spot you from here. Okay, listen Robert... Umm, I think you're really, really great... I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say. Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done. Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs. Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here? Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles. Hmm, bummer. No. But thanks. Okay. No. But thanks. Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please? Where's Chandler? Oh. Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie! Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together. You never run on a barge! Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire! It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know. You think you know me so well. Yeah. That's what I said. I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives. I stepped in something icky. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault. Oh, yeah! I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up. Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you? Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it. Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be? Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song? Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far. Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas! I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is. Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace. Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there. In your atlas! Oh. Oh. Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me. What is this? Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here. Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you! Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over. Oh. See there it is right there. Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it. Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way. Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute. Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry! Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali. Interesting. Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing? Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other. That would be great. Thank you. Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it. Well, tell him, apology accepted. Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner? Plate! Yes, plate. See, we don't need them. Yeah. Ameri-can. Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again. Hey! Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling? Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine. The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail. Now what is Fabutec? Waxine!! Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl. God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that? They have the best stuff in there. After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one, Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion. Was it not pain-free? Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad. Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!! Oh!! Ow!!! We’re all right. We’re all right. For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience. Oh yeah, come here. Uh-huh. What, what are they talking about? Whe-where did he put it?! Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday. Should we do something? Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there. We could eat the wax! It’s organic. No, not the used wax. They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they? Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved. They’ve been quiet for a long time. Oh come on, they can be in the same room. Why? What happened now? Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else. Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow. Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy.... Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let’s scidaddle. Okay, your highness. Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?! No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out. Ohhh boy, do I feel bad. Chandler what are you doing?! Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum? Him? Him, Ross? Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets. Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around. Chandler!! What does the sign say? No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab. Please! Aren’t you gonna go? No, y'know what don’t close it ‘cause the... keys.. are in there. Okay, Monica’s are the biggest. All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine. Okay, there. Okay. Oh, no! Yeah, this has happened before. Yep. Put more gas in. Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up. Yeah, what town are we near? Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on? Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76? Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don’t do that. But if... Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back. Ross, thank God. I ate a bug. Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck. Yes, please. Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives! Hi! You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing? Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other. Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil? Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported. Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. Or, or the rodeo!! Okay! Bye!!! All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men. Oh my God!! Frank! Hi! What are you doing here? What happened? But, also, what happened between you and your Mom? Your getting married?! My little brother’s getting married!! Do I? Yeah, I do, yeah. Yeah, isn’t it fantastic? What, he’s 18. Yeah, I’m a big surprise. Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that? Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t. No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong! No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat! But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics. Yes. Not out loud. Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it. Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?! Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. You’re Frank’s best man?! Well then, what about you?! Huh?! Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me? Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined. Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank. Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark? Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day? What umm, what happened? Oh no. Did umm, did she say why? Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best? Oh, sweetie, oh. Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay? Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will. Okay. Okay, but. Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can. Yeah, but not just that. None the less. That’s right, exactly. All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. . We were out of Doritos. Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out. What, so what are you gonna tell him? Huh. Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father. Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then. So, you’re like a zillionaire? Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself. Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete. Yeah, kinda. Hey! Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman... It isn’t? Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man! Okay well, he would turn things to gold. Ahh, his work is done. Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this! Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way. Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel. No, just a barrel. Really?! Really?! Hey! Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful. So, I’m here, ready to play. I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. That’s a dog, every house should have a dog. Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic. Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government. Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof! Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination. The little ones do. Hey! Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!! Look, look! Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs.

Okay, here you go. Oh my God, are you guys okay? Umm, oh, about three months. Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks? Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love. Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman. I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No? ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and... Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift. Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what? No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks. Hey! What? Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you. Ooh, I have to tell you something. But I can’t tell you. Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.

I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see. Oh, I, I do, I believe you. Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next. Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right? No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 801. ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one. Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back. Fine! Fine! Oh-oh! Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call. Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people. Vince is a fireman. Okay. Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight. I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler. Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't. That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God! Oh my God!!! No! No! Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here! Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy. Uh. Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field. Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. Yeah. Jason is not a sissy! God, that is the nicest kitchen. No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day. All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince. Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck! Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here? Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those. Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore. I’m sorry. Oh my God, I didn’t. Wait-wait-wait! Wait!! I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy. Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing. Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests? No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me. Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal. Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and, Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so’s Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So, It’s really just about the math. Jason? Nah-ha! Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-- wear Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show. Hey! I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince! Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible. Really?! Well, this is none of my business. Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park. Well, that could’ve been really awkward. Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you. All right, so, so you went to Pete’s... So Monica, what were you gonna tell us? No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name. Well then definately don’t take his name. Oh?! Oh. Yeesh, what’d you do about it? Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something? Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date? Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it... You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald... Great! Okay, good for you! Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. Well I hope you have fun tonight. Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now. I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people. Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay. Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality. Oh no, Bonnie’s the best! So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? Ohh, that’s too bad! Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain? No! No! Look at that! It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team! Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go. Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive. You said it was okay! What?! What-what-what-what-what?!! Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross? Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy? So? Oh no. Oh, we killed them all. Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look. Y'know what that means? No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever. I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach? So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk. Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house. Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma. And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat. Oy!! Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage. Knock, knock, knock. Are you ah, Phoebe Abott? Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter! No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember? Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess. Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy. No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him? Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything. Oh, what? What was it? Yeah, no, it was great. Oh, hey! Oh, so, how are we doing? I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like? Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is. She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now? I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored? All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it. Okay. Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this. Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited. Come on, take 'em off!! Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep. After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm. She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me! Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me. Yeah, well, don't "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!" me yet. Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is. Well, are any of those people here?! Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays. Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh! No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise! I'm sorry. I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays. Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth! My Father is Chuck Magioni? Oh. Heh?
