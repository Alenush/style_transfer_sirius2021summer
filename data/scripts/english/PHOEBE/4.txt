Ehh? I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off! How close? I don't even know how that would work! I'm not asking! Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand. Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you. I don't ever want to see you again! Umm, where's my purse? Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom. Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner! No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone. Monica! Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh. Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car. Hi, Ursula. Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom. You know her?! There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it? I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note! I, umm, shut up! Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this! Noooo!! No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk. ...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm. Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away. Okay, bye. No. But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know? It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common. I-I like pizza! Oh my God, so do I! Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly? Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you. Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry. All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out. ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks. Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center? Yeah, I actually don't know... Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God. Nothing. Nothing. I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother. No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself. No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like ....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years! Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive. Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room. Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. Hi. Yeah? So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred. I just feel so, uhh..... Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo. Yeah? Hi! Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right? Ross, how many parents have you lost? Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive. Okay. I think she would like that. Thank you. We both forgive you. Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime. Come on, Mom, I'll take you home. How come? Okay, I didn’t hear that. Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! That’s weird. Your nails. Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now. Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat that’s the problem. And! Whoever finds it wins the prize! I don’t get it. Op, the ruined quiches are ready. Hey! This used to be your room? Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid. Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica. No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica. Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change. Wow! My breasts are really strong. They’re not even touching the lasagna! Oh, they love your casserole. It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients. Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn’t know we switched it. Oh. Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country. Hey! New wallet, huh? Oh please, somebody tell me I don`t have to go to work today! Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I`m not allowed to charge for. Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it`s against my oath as a masseuse. No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one`s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense. No, I can handle it. No, I`m a professional. I don`t know what your talking about. Because it`s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone! These old things. You mean the.... Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion. Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y`know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area. Oh. No! Hey. Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him. On the touchy. No, I know! I-I`m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one. Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little? Oh no...wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick`s pants come down a little. No! No! Okay Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that`s working. Chandler`s knees. Chandler`s ankles. Chandler`s ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you`re all set. Yeah! In a really long hour world. Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because your`re a client, I can`t ask you out, even though you give me y`know, the feeling. Really?! What? Okay, quit down. Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn`t what it looks like, `cause Rick is my ahh, husband. Yes, I will tell her. Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore. It`s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before! I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y`know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It`s been a really bad day, whore wise. Yeah, they thought I was a whore. Great! Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh. But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh? Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smellycat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey. My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters. Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy. So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing. Hey. Hi. Wow, cute one! Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm! Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common. What?! Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her! You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that! Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket. Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water. Sure. But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice. It's okay. How's the soup? Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice? Gunther, kiss me. And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies. Hey what are you guys looking at? Yeah, come to papa. Oo! Is it for my birthday present? Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet? 'Kay. Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!" It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow! Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not? There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving! Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months. Yes, but I'm doing this. Ooo, a crossword! Can I help? Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language. Mon! I'm so happy for you! I'll have one, please. Plus my money. Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank. Yes. Did you settle the bill? Oh, look what we almost left. Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! But Mon, you have to get our money! I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was? Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!" Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. She seems fine now. You didn't get the money, did you? No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow? Okay, Widow! Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go. Good. Uh... yay! Yeah. I'm a hard ass. Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime! Okay! Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties! Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..." Darn it! Now, I don`t know who to get to the next verse. Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about bah-bah-bha-bhan? Oh yeah, that`s right, the keyboards, huh? I wanna hear "The Sound." Come on, play that funky music white boy. Wow, it was so....wow! What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it`s just, it`s so different from the stuff you usually hear. It`s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go! Oh no, I`m not playing tonight. I can`t follow Ross! It`d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No. Oh my God, he`s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time! You guys. You suck too. Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great! Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I-I can`t I mean y`know I was trying to be really ya know okay and upbeat about it, I just, I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I.... Oh no. No-no-no, don`t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music. Does Joey know? I think maybe, yeah. Yeah! No, that`s right. And I thought it was a really good idea. Oh my God, he`s lost it. He`s totally lost it. After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help. Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving! Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who. I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh! Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade! Ohh. You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want. God, what happened?! Open it up, let me see. Ooh, God it looks bad. Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number? Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor? Yes! She's very excited about that. This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. Okay, get out of my kitchen! All right I.. I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted. Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it." Oh, I'll get it. Oh, he-he can't talk right now. He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him. They were threefold. Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging! Oh, there they are! All right, get a room. Okay! Okayyyyy, open up! Yeah, it's for our catering business! No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette. And also, we don't know what to do with this. Oh sure, Cilantro Larry. How could you say yes, what about our catering business? Oh, in that case, Yay! That was me hopping on board. Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy? Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm. Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place. Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering. No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed? Yeah, all right. Bye! Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go. Hey, Monica! Hey! Yeah. I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and You got the job!! Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception. But we've only had one job. Yeah! What are you saying? What? You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money! For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here. Okay, I'm hearing. What?! I wa-I wa-I wa... Monica! No. No. Really?! Are you sure? Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job. Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy. Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team. Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. Where were you? Oh, which museum? No, answer his. Umm, that paper's two weeks old. What's wrong Mon? Oh. Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.' Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it? Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel! Oh, yay! I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name! All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme? Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph? You work with robots!! No! No, the robots just work for them. If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all? Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant? Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry... What? So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God! So, did you pick one yet? Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done! Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague. There's sooo much you don't know. "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. '''''''''''''''''' Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. '''''''''''''''''' Said all you need is to write them a song. '''''''''''''''''' They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. '''''''''''''''''' No, don't sing along. My little brother is married! You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping? Wait, wait. Why were you at the courthouse? Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too! Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't! So, ooh, I'm going to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need? That's a really *nice* gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat. Hey! Guess what? Frank Jr. and Alice got married. And they're going to have a baby! Yeah! And they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. Yeah. Eww! And no, no! They want me to be the surrogate. It's her egg and his sperm. I'm just the oven. It's totally their bun. Well, they said I had to think about it first. But what is there to think of? I'm going to be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give. I know. Yeah, what's your point? You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture. My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did! Hi. Sorry I'm late. Wow, you really go all out for company. Oh, OH! Oh, I didn't know you did...pot. Oh, ooh! Erotery! Okay. Why not? Oh, I understand. Don't, don't hurt the puppy. Oh, I get a puppy? Why? Okay.  Mom: I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first. All right, it's okay. Oh, you know what? I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony. Uh, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Oh, listen, don't go on the balcony until I get back. My mom's going to be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes, no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No. My mom was right. If I can't give *him* up, there's no way I can give up a little baby. Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed. What, what else can I give them? A kidney? Okay. Hey, why don't you? Uh-huh, yeah! No, I'm really okay with this. You know why? Cause look at them. Look how happy there are. And I made that. I know it's going to be like a million times harder to give up a baby but oh my God! It's going to feel like a million times better, right? Uh-huh. Oh, I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm going to carry their baby. No, no, I know. You and I are totally different people. And this is a totally different situation. And I know that I'm not going to regret this. Hey! You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment. All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus. Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick. Okay everyone, think thick. Hi! Wish me luck! Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning. Embryossss? As in, "More than one?" Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs? That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all! Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right. Whoa!! That`s okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there, is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant? Wow! You guys really don't know anything! Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so. Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen. Uh-huh. Good luck. Hey! Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted. Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket. All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now. Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine. Nope, not knocked up yet. Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs. "Are you in there little fetus? '''' ''''''''''''' In nine will you come great us? '''''''''''''''''' I will buy you some Adidas." Oh. Oh. All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this. Great. You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby! Okay, but this can't be good for the baby. Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school? Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive. Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy? That sounds great! Hey! Ooh! How was Kathy's play? That's a good idea for a business! Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. Oh-okay, I get the game now. Oh. Rachel has a new doll. Ooh, what do I smell? Ooh! What? What? Well, I hate to eat and run, but.... Yeah, I don't need it. Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment? If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here! Oh, are we gonna trash that place? Wait a minute. Why don't you ask him out? He just got a divorce right? So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move. You've never asked a guy out?!! Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it? Oh, please! I've never done that. No, sorry. Great! Oh did you, what did you, did you work for two days straight? Oh good! How? How is your fault? So now, what is this now? And this? You make it so funny. Hey! I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening. Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me. Don't you just love the way they talk?! Ohh! It kicked! I think the baby kicked! Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted. Why? Ohh! So, did you get to meet her? Aww, Pheebs. That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other! Shhh!! Please! What's he saying? What? Oh my God! Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us. Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys! Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!! I'm sorry. Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant. Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha! I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic. Come on! Look where you are!! Remember, a virgin for me please. Well, if you think it will help. You should! How is she? Who, Josh? Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls. And do you know what girls are really good at? No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk. Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one. Yeah. Oh! What is that? What is that? Hey, ooh so, how was Vermont? I-I wanna be with her, I like her. Ohhh, wow. What?! I thought you were crazy about her! Yep! Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!! Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining. Janice. Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller. Well, why are you doing this anyway? You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right. Hi. Whoa! I kinda liked it. No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so.... Oh, poor baby. She's right! You have to stop! Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor? Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it. Hey! Ha-ha. No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I - my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool! Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour! Hey! What are you doing here? Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus. Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar. Hi! Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon. No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The." Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don’t, maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk. God, Susan is so fun! Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross. No! No! I-I meant for the baby! Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never happen to like The Hulk, y’know. So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler. Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey? All right, so, what are we supposed to call you? Umm, Gene. Bye, Gene. Oh my God! Wow, Carol really messed you up! Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right. All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city! Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t. Drum roll. You’re actually going through with this? You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact, yes, I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler. Yeah, but you have to keep the name too! Okay! Yeah! Yay! Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now! Ooh, uh.. Okay, bye! Hello! Excuse me. Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable! What? Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh. I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know. You’re clothes aren’t funny. Boy! I didn’t see that coming! That’s too hard. Too hard! Hey, so? Are you gonna do it? Or you could end up with everything. Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet? Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh, oh, I have a game! This is great! Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name, oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees? Good! Good! Five points! All right, Joey, same question. Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy. Oh, I have cards! Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay. What make you think I can?! I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha! I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it. That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all. Okay, scarf’s done. Hey! What? Oh, are you pregnant too?! Hey! Oh, the Olympics. I still cannot believe you’re engaged! Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser. Already?! Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced. You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen. No-no, let me in! Yeah! No, you have to let me in right now!! Yes! Yeah. I got it! Mine! Thank you! Okay! Okay, ready? Okay. I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real! Yeah, I think we are. Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, "It’s Not Too Late." Me too. Me too. Okay. Yay! I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life. I guess. Oh my God! Oh, you’re such a cheater! Hey! Oh, how’d that happen? What is that? Oh, how did it go? What did he say? Yeah, maybe. Any luck? Hey, y’know what might cheer you up? No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride! Not after this! Hey! What-what’s up? Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die! So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me? Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine! Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding? I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester! Remembered what? Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. See, he's her lobster.
