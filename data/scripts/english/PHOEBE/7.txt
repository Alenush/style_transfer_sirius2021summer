Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet. So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical. Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment? Oh, 19! We thought you said 90! Oh honey no, you ate it all. Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay. I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit. Okay. You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding? What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed... Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem. Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s, maybe no more for you though. Why?! Yeah? Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding. Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away. Would she? Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit. Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date. Oh, I see. Y’know, I don’t really need their permission. Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes. They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes. Maybe just 10 minutes for you.   Oh thank you. Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer...Oh oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning. It starts? That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now. Hey! Ross! I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler. Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days? Nothing....Why?! Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies? Oh Ross, hi. I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now. Okay, let’s talk outside. What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s! Okay, well Ross, what is this really about? Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is! My God! What did you order?! Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself? Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler. Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with. Ross! How could you do that to an old man?! My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon. He said you poked at him with wooden spoons. Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week! Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back! So what do you guys want for an engagement present? Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist. You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe? You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family? Break my heart....Oh, all right. If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it? Your own boat? I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up! Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present. Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left. Why not? Really?! You do? That and arrogance. I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage. Come on, it’s not that big a deal! Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale? Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those. Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now. Oh yeah...No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure. Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032. That’s what you think. Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse. Nesele Toulouse. Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language. Yes!! Ohh. I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell!! I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I...no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him. Uh-huh, yeah that’s right. What? You mean behind my back? Oh God! Oh hey! Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye. Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified. Let’s see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that... it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks. Hey...Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out? Sorry. What happened? You! An actor?! That’s madness! Hi! You must be Hilda. Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number. So you hired yourself a little treat did ya? But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant. Oh Willie’s still alive! Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty. Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer. Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid. Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out! He is! But he’s getting divorced...Ross! Maybe you know him. You don’t have to be back for a half-hour! So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else? I’m having a really good time! Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend. Yeah, I... Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost. Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go. Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross? Yeah, umm that’s Whitney , Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out? Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. Hi Ginger. I don’t have it! Ugh, okay Sherlock! All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex. Okay. Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her! Watching ballroom dancing? Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her. Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and...No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you! And! She uses sex as a weapon! You’re still gonna go out with her?! Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?! No listen to me! She is crazy! You see? Nothing is good enough for her! Hi. So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom. You think he’s emotionally unavailable? Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night! Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997. We want the last six years back!! Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney? Oh he knows! For the most part. Both of you together? What about her whining and her constant need for attention?! Oh right, because you’re so capable of change. Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass. Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to. And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club! Potato, Potaato. Ooh, let’s see it! You guys make a very attractive couple. I hope it’s you. Yes!!! Oh!! Still. Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours? Wh-why is that the best part? Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady! Hey Rachel? Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor? Uh-hmm. Oh! Well, if that’s what you want... But why does it even matter?! Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry! You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice! And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it. Oh, thank you so much! Okay. Oh I know. See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie! Na-uh, I am! Because I cared enough to lie! What are you talking about? Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it? Well, it’s better than us deciding. No! Coins hate me! Hey there, you handsome thing. Ugh, what a kiss ass. Yes! Your honor? Oh! Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?! Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. Really?! I won! The coins have finally forgiven me! Rach, it’s gonna be okay! You guys are the best! Hi! That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today. Oh yeah! Oh that’s so sweet thanks. Ohh. This stuff is great! Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor. Because I think it means more to you. It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? Man alive! Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor. Okay! And call me! We want you to marry her! She is so amazing! You have no idea. Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages. Yeah, but you always say that. Whatever. Secret affair! Oh. Hey! Oh no. Hey! Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore? Didn’t you sleep together? Then change it back! No spark? Didn’t you sleep together? Does Joey have any idea? Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner. Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak. No, just a regular old flying dwarf. Hey! So how was, how was your date? Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you? Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her. Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery. Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that. Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. Oh, it's not! It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help? I'm sorry, who's this? No, there's no dog here? Oh my god! Where are you? They're here already? How are they doing this? There's no dog in here. No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room. Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people? That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days Are you crazy? Why? You don't like ice cream? All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. Oh, I'd say about a month. Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. Yeah, okay. You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know. I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart. Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? Where's Chandler? Wash your hands!!! No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. Hey, is Chandler here? Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. We have good news, look whose back! It's a Thanksgiving miracle! Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting! I never had a bike of my own. Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on. No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard. Not really, I got to drag him around too! Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it! Sure! Oh my God Ross!! I love it!! Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you! Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer! Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten. Oh and Chandler’s about to cry. Oh hi! Ohh, uh-huh so much! Of course! Okay. See? Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat...or a beanbag chair! Why? Why do I have to learn? What kind of an emergency? Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star. You won’t let go? Swear?! Okay. All right. Well... Okay. Okay. Weee!!! Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore! I am shocked! Shocked!! Oh, hello liar. I could’ve been killed I hope you know! Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. What?! What the hell?! What?! Why?! All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. Okay Ross! Please don’t die! I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross. Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. Hey! Haaaa... ... ahhhh! Huh? Oh, yeah, it's my mom's. No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die. Oh, hey, you guys! Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out. Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. Yeah, why not? Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey? Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore? You're sure? You're absolutely sure? Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing! So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay! That's fun. Hey! Hey! Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. Maybe on some level. Hey, Joey, I got you another present. It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage? Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. Our apartment is ready. Because you would rather live here with Joey. Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that. Hm? Fish! Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here... We did have fun, didn't we? Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight. Yay, okay! Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop. Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore...Ooh! New sconces! What? Yeah? Yeah? Oh no! Oh! Wow!!! Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up. There’s a skylight?! Wow!! Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that. A little bit, yeah. You heard her too?! You have the gift! Are you sure? Oh me too. No, I do not hear that. Oh. Oh. Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral? There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing? Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s pretty amazing too. Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie! Shh! Get me out of here. Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can.... Don’t interrupt me!! Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!! Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch! Oh my God! How did you get back here?! Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer...fireman, can-can I help you? That’s not mine. How do you know? Okay do you....Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America! Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off! There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God! What? What happened to the window in the attic?! I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic! Hey. Ugh, I hate this year! Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world! Oh that’s right! Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. Oh yeah, like you never called! Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office. Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs. Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you’re right, this is easy. Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude. Oh. No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner? Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner. May I ask why? I surely do! Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner? No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me. Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself? Chandler? No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist! Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you. All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend? Oh sorry, boyfriend! No, whatever! Anything! Yeah, he’s gotta go. No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!! Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here. Earl! I’m Phoebe. Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself. No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it! Because it was fate that made me call you today! No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself. Yes. I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this. No, it’s fate! Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager. Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl. Sure! Umm, where are you from? Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm. But if...no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot! Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it’s you. Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast! Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me. I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud? Okay, who’s next? Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts. Least of all you. Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!! Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth! Because it’s our thirtieth birthday. Wait! Yeah. What?! Nu-uh! You have your birth certificate? Our mom. Do you have my birth certificate? Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31. I just lost a whole year of my life. Your middle name is Pamela? Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is? That’s my first name. Hey, what’s going on? Yay! I love drunk Monica! Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her. Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother. If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop. Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh? Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet! Wooo!! Hoo!! Okay quick, help me get this off! I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair! Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31? Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31! Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school! No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. Oh yeah. Oh! You did the right thing. Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay? Yeah? Why? Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. Ohh, he left his cell phone. Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing. Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long. That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex. No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago. Nice try. I don’t know. Ah-ha! Too cocky! Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone. Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet. Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide. Did I use that already today? I’m sorry. Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you. So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial? Hi! Good. Yeah. Yeah! Ooh, now you lost me. No I didn’t! No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work! That is a different phone. That is damning evidence. Hello? Yes, I’m the one who found your phone. Shhh! I’m on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. Bye. Oh? And how will you know what time to come over? Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide. What?! That’s the first time today! Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door? Because it’s my apartment! Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China. Wow! How long were we arguing for? Could you-could you umm, give us one second? Wh-what do we do? Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up! Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore! Rachel, listen...I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one. Yeah! You’re such a great friend! Oh that’d be me. Sir. After you. Nice! Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! With what? Oo! You should have one of us do it! No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff! Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal! What?! No! It was my idea! Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache! Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering! What is it? Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. Oh. It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called? Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story! Say what? Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules! Why? I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! Okay, then I must be disoriented. I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling? Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes? Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects! Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night. What?! I know! Robin is so gay! I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up. Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief! Oh, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria...Oh. Since when are you into swing music? What is your job? Am I crazy or does this totally go?! Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica! Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great! Got it. Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!! I’m coming! I’m coming! Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress? Did you find the dress? I—We gotta get Monica. Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me! I know. Hand me a tissue. What?! Does that mean Carcass is available? Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it. Yeah, swing music is so out. Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living. Oh my God! I’m sorry, too soon. You go. Good for you! Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out! Go for it. I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill. I did, but that was really fun. Oh hey! Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?" I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six. You sound like a guy. You’ll have a last kiss. Okay bye. Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love. I miss you too!!!! No. Why? Okay, don’t sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. No, that is the last thing you want to do! Because you’re marrying him! All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband. That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight. Yes! Oh my God! You’re right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? Rach? Oh. It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in… …in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!! Oh hey! How was your audition? What are you doing? Oh! You got it?! The next next? What’s the matter? Grandma’s gonna have to get in line. Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous? Sure. Hey! Yeah! What?! Well, when can we have this shower? Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option? Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done! Rachel, calm down! Just calm down woman! Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little. Uh, here. What time? Finger sandwiches and tea. And chili! Both! Neither. Lusts of the flesh. I don’t know. A cowboy theme? Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone. Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you? Hey! Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! We have a guest list! Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. Hi! How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming. Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it’s so nice to see you. Okay. Hey Rach? Who the hell are all these people? Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that: Losers! You were supposed to tell her! Fine, I’ll go call her. And then for forgetting to invite you to it. Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave. We ruined everything. Sur-surprise. Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there? Oh! No problem! I… Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin! I like our way. Oh! Chess! Yeah. Hey! Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight? What is this? What’s going on? Joey’s! Yeah, I’m sure that happened. Sure! Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek. Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla. Yeah. To Ross. Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it. Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon. Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning. Really?! Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding. Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa. I know. I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I’ve had better. What?! Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. Oh! Yeah! Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you. Like… Or all the things you taught him. Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute. Hey! Well let’s just say its.. she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing. Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce? Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.? Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!! Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!! CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!! OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!! NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!! YOU KNOW?!!! Get in here!!! Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows? Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own Bye Chandler! I miss you already. I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more! No! God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything! He's not backing down. He went to get lotion. Joey! Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons. Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra. You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now. Ooh. Here it comes. Our first kiss. And why not?! You're-you're what?! I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love! Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things. How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership. Hey. Oh! Okay. Oh, that’s beautiful.
