Hey!
Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
Is that Ross?
Sounds like he's with someone.
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Get over here!
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
That's the door. He's gone...
Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
Now, what is this?
Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Aaah... you're not good at this...
No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
What?
Why not?
You have a... You have a date? With who?
You have... have a girlfriend?
For how long?
Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Hi, Mike's place.
Ooh, that was fast.
Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
I... I'm Phoebe.
Enchanté
Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
Well, I don't...
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
You're welcome!
Hey guys!
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Hey, what's all this stuff?
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
Oh, how does it work?
Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Hey!
Good to see you.
Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
That's a, that's a long time.
Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
What?
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
Insane.
Alice would never go for it, right?
Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
Frank Jr.Jr.?
Uh-huh.
Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
Hey.
Still, he had to find out sometime.
Hey!
Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
I did!
Hey!
No.
Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Are you kidding, I love it!
Hi!
Musty!
Well...kinda.
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Please, Monica? In the hall?
It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Joey, it's a birthday party.
Oh!
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Separate performances.
Sure, yeah!
Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . “Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
No, it did not.
Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
No, lets just draw straws.
Yeah!! Let's do that!
Ok! I want the dolphin!
I'm too excited!
Go! Go!
Good job Alan!
Yeah, see you later!
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
Hey, you made it into a bunny.
Hey!
Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
YEAH!
Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! . Can’t believe it's been a whole year!
ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Well, mine was worse than that.
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
Well, do you think I should propose?
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Uhuh, uhuh...
I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
Well, I think you should wait.
Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
That's not very enlightened!
Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
It's in the cake, isn't it?
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Oh my God!
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Uh-huh!
Yes!
I love you more!
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
I would, but you're the last one.
Oh, my first love!
Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
Oh yes, they are.
Hey!
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Yeah.
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Why, you don't like her?
Really? You think?
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!
Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Hey!
You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
I knew it!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Hey!
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
You're not making the pies yourself?
Hey Rach.
What's Emma doing today?
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Oh... okay.
Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Well, I was thinking...
Yeah!
Hey.
We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Why not!
Oh!
No, we're late!
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
And it looks like she put makeup on her!
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .
It's locked.
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Oh yeah!
Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
So bad.
Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
I'll pull you through.
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
What are you gonna name the baby?
Hey!
Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Mandy.
No.
Fine, I'll give you her number.
SARAH!
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
What?
I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Oh
Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
What? You know about the plate thing?
You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Wow!
Yeah!
What? They will be!
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Oh, how cute!
Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
OH! He's having an affair.
You know, I'm always right about these things.
Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
What?
Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
I got them!
So, should we tell her?
Why? Who’d you seen him with?
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
They went in together. So sorry.
What?
Why do you have a realtor?
So you're gonna move?
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Yeah, but so is this.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
What else?
That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
You're gonna be okay?
Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
Great!
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Thank you so much for this.
Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Oh!
Oh, God!
Rachel?
Are you kidding?
How old is your phonebook?
Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Shocking!
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Finish it!
Your last dance. Do it for us.
Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Oh, hey Joey.
Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
So... what do you say?
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Oh.
Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Ok.
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
She did? Why?
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
Hey!
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
Rehearse it!
So Rach.
Where is Emma?
What's up?
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
I don't have a fax machine.
I decided to pee.
Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
Hey!
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Wow, this is a lot!
You won awards?
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
Okay.
Oh my God, what's it doing here?
Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
Help me.
I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Please?
More than I wanna get married.
About what?
I know.
What?
What do you think?
Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Oh, thank you.
I love you guys.
Okay.
Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Thank you.
Na-ah.
When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family.
Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
I do.
I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
Hi
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Oh, why? What's up?
Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
Well, just... let's try it again.
Je m'appelle Claude.
Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
It does, really?
All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
Je m'appelle Claude.
Oh, mon Dieu!
Hi!
Oh!
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Je m'appelle Claude.
Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
m'ap
pelle
Great, ok faster! "je"
m'ap
pelle
Je m'appelle!
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
Hey Joey.
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Really, can I hear some of it.
Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
How could you possibly think that?
Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé.
Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...
Merci. Au revoir.
Okay, can you really tapdance?
It's off the resumé.
Archery?
Horseback riding?
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Ready... GO!
You did it!
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Wow!
I do, he's been working on that all day!
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Where did you go to do it?
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
Okay!
Good for you. That was really mature.
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Well, not anything, I mean...
Oh, this could take a while.
Okay.
Hey!
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Uh! Princess Consuela.
Uh-huh!
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Ross...
Can you?
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
Oh God!
Welcome back!
Oh, me too!
Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
Nope.
Yep.
Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Mike Crap Bag?
You're not serious, right?
Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
And I love Crap.
Thank you, mister Bag.
Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.
Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Yeah.
Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
It's a funny word.
...Oh crap!
Hey!
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Uh-hmm.
Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
I know.
Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
Ok.
Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Oh, you're so screwed.
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Yeah!
These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Where do you think Mike really is?
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Tell me about it.
All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
How was your night?
Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
Okay.
All right, ready?
All right, here it goes...
Morning.
What's that?
It's a baby chick and duck!
I did not see that coming.
Yes.
That is the rule, though.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Have you seen him throw a ball?
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
But do you wanna get back together?
YAY!
Yay!
Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Unbelievable!
Hey, what are you working on?
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
What?
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
Uh, Joe?
No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
Hey! What do you have there?
Honey, that's gorgeous!
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
One? How about a whole bunch?
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
So, you just let her go?
But now she'll never know how he feels!
Woo!
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
Hurry!
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
Okay!
I - I don't take passengers.
My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
Get out of the cab!
You can open your eyes now.
Yes.
Yes, she jumped right back up.
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
You should have thought of that before you got in!
Toll-booth.
Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Hurry!
Okay.
Damn, that window is clean.
Ross, where are you going?
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
We're on our honeymoon.
I'm so lucky I married you.
No, did we miss it?
Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
She's got her cell, you could call her.
You don't have any other choice!
Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Uh, Rach, hang on.
Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
I don't see her.
There she is!
RACHEL!!
Okay, you're on.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
So, I guess this is it.

Ooh, what's going on? Good for you! Of course we can. Congratulations.  Yay!  Joey... You okay with this? Talking to Ross. Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? She died. Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one. Yeah, she was just an agent. Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge. Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else. Hey. Everything ok? Estelle? Why? I'm guessing she does. Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her. Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. Joey, it's Estelle. Man, tough week for Estelle! Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok? No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might. No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart. All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?  Joey, it's Estelle. Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me. Well, I didn't think I should just drop by... Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay. It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
