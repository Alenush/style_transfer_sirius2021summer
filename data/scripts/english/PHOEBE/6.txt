Okay! Okay! Okay! Hey! Don’t you give me any of your...Hey! Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you run in the chapel! What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage. Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas. Really?! Oh my God!...Eh! Well... Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast? What about my cab? No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back. I don’t know, it’s such a long trip. Are you asking me to have a frenaissance? All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you. Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute. Well you don’t. Good! Good! I was just testing you. No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch. Hell, I’m drunk right now! What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation! Oh-oh, that’s your thing. You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced. Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I’m so drunk. Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any QUESTIONS!!! Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper! Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. Sing!! How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape..., a rapist or a killer or something! Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?! Do you like car games? I love the license plate game! No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! Oh, okay. And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court. Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice! You can still sleep at night and stuff. Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich? Is it a meatball sub? No thanks, I’ve already seen one. Always. What?! Always. What?! Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second? Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn’t get the annulment?!! Ross?! Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive. So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!...Op, woman! Sorry. Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay! Hey Rach! Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie? Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! Hey! No, why? You’re pregnant! Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe. Guys, I’m happy too. Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled... Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel.... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?! Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates. Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces! Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here. Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him? Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him? Okay, what about you? Wouldn’t you want a date? Whatever! What about you Meg? She said, "He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her. Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg. Okay, bye! So? Did you get the annulment? I knew it! Because you love Rachel. Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love. I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her. Oh we do, but not just yet. Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out. I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids. But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem. I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him. Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! Uh-huh, what? Oh! Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise? My roommate. Yes, Denise. Denise! Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!! Hey. So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? You didn’t tell her did you? Of course not, because you’re in love with her. What do you mean, comforted her? Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug! Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair? Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist. Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are. Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love! Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now. Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. It worked! Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay!" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor. I saw it. Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her! I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid. What?! Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid. No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! Okay, that’s a lie. I found you in my bed! How’d you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair. Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. Yes. Ross, I know what you’re thinking. That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad. What?!! No! Yeah, Professor and Mrs. Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married. Just kidding! Saved your ass. Hi. Well, you know that psychic I see? Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that. Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get. I don’t, she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black. No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.) Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me. Hey! Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could... I was preparing you for my, didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off? Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can. Hey! What’s going on? Hey! Maybe you’ll die! No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday. No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys! Hey! Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die! Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong! Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies! Have you really done this before? Hey! We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back. Oh my God!! Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core! Another lie. You have a sickness! Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?! Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya! Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself! What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate. Maybe you could be my roommate! Yeah! Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th. I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast? Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered. Hey! I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy. No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up. What?! Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep. Oh, I can still do that. How did that happen?!! Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting! But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me! But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years. I’m pretty sure it’s gun. A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do? Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now who aren’t there! How do you feel? Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed. I know, the babies are asleep. I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? Well, how much do you think he needs? Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. And also, my birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you. Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that. I have plans. That’s right. Okay. Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don’t remember? Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss. Come on, there’s gotta be something. Good! Great! You can go first. Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better? Great! It worked! No one’s sad. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? Hey! I call her! Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her! I know, I took it hard too. Hey, how are you guys doing? Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down. Well, deep-deep-deep down! Then keep running. Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore. You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! What else? That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!! Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that? Ready? Okay. it's... and... please... leave... Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it. All right, so let's switch. Okay. Hi! It's, and Please...wait, how did you do that? Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you? Really? Okay, let's go running! Let's run towards them! All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks! Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green. I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up. Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go! Hey! Why? Why would you do that? Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself. Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. Sure So, what should you have done? Uh-Huh, Which is...? So? Why do you care? But people that you don't know and will never see again. Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight. That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbour's dog. Hey! See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone! Hey. Rachel? I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine. Oh my God. What happened? Well that’s great! Congratulations!! You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you. Thank you. Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in. Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser. Totally. Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know. No! What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? No, yeah, I should. Hey. Here. Ohh, who’s the silver fox? That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though. Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack. What? Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren? Ohhh. Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!! But why didn’t you just tell her the truth. Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that? Just for a second. Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, sleep with Kenny. Ohh, yes it would. Hey! Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else! And who else is going to be there? Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy. Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night. Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad, and now he’s he’s ...Jack Geller, dream hunk." Rachel? Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of condensed milk. Monica, leave him alone! So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it? Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant? I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. Ohhh no. Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack. I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl. Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen. Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman. I love Jacques Cousteau! That is nice and we’re done. TADA! Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you. No-no, we do it every year! No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx. But we have to! Well then, you should look with us. Oh, that’s it? A great idea! Ooh ooh, we have a live one! Ooh, who’s it for? Uh-oh. She may be onto us. Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap! Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great! Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. Hey! Look who I found! Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. Or we could just follow your clever jokes... any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are! Hmm, how about my azzz? What? No, don’t look directly at them! Alright, no, we could look at them! Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here. And the big one’s for me! Hee hee! Will you get us better gifts? Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless. I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes. Hey. Wh-wh-what are you doing? Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes! Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? Rachel. I don’t know. Me neither. I guess it was kinda funny. Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re... just kinda high maintenance, okay let’s go to lunch! No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all. Ya, you know, Rachel... she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her. Oh, okay, you’re not a pushover. Okay. That true, I am flaky. Yeah, totally. That’s great. Good for you guys. Who said you were? Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything. Really? I’ve heard better. Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive. Wow! That is a bad audition. Rach, you’re in my seat. Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend. Yeah, well, I kinda thought. Yeah Joey that is so gross! I’m pretty. Oh I do! Oh, y’know what? No. Wait a second. I know it’s in here somewhere. Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter? Never mind, I got it. Of course, yeah! Ooh, I like cards. Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea. I would love that job! Sorry Jill. Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y’know "I want a job sweater." And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants. Yeah, you never heard of them? What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I? Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it! Hey. Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know. No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them. Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there. Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Okay then. But great news about the apartment pants, huh? Yeah me too. Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that. All right, what’s going on there? Oh Chandler! So that story doesn’t make you cry? Yeah? Yeah. Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah! You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He’s a fan. Bye! Hey! What’s up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!! It’s Phoebe! Phoebe! Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies. You’re making one right now! And-and you’re using my name! Look, I’m talking right now! You’re you mean her. What?! No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you with that! Hey! So, I just came from the company Ursula works for. No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them. Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address. Oh no! No! I know how to handle it. Yeah. You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See? Wow! No! Barry and Mindy. Which time? What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch? Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks. Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. Hey! What? Ohh that’s so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired. Hi! Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who’s this? Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I.. Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name. No-no!! No!! No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars. What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts. My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe. Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm? Then yes that is what I’m having. Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan. So what’s going on with you? Still going through that dry spell with Carol? How long has it been since you had sex? Oh that’s not so bad. That is. Maybe you need to spice things up a little. I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other. Y’know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys... Roll playing. You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench! Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! It never happened. Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects. No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me! Okay! Okay! I’m so glad you’re here. Oh, give it to me. Give it! Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?! Thank God. Hey. Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy! What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea! What are you two girls whispering about over there?! Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do? Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother! Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change...ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?! I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon. No. I’ve learned my lesson. Let’s go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. Surprise! Look who’s back! Hey! Uh, I don’t think so! Jack!! Hey! All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh? Nu-uh! Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count. Anyway, I’ll be in my office. That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake... Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that...Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding! I’m having another heart attack! I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!! Dumbass! Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack. Yeah.  Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this goin’ on. Wow! I still have it! Hey! Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today! Now, we can kick anybody’s ass! Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel! Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is. You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? No. Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea! You guys! Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make? What is that? Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud! Now, it’s you little bunny friend. Ross!!! Ohh, you’re a freak!! Pat Sajak? Alex Trebek? Chuck Woolery? Say we are unagi! No Rachel! They got here first! Why is Ross doing that? We should help him! What’s a Movement class? Oh my God! How bad was it? Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through! Oh! Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying! No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now. Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house! Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here. Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room. What’s that smell? So did you sleep well last night? Yeah? Y’know what Joey left on my pillow? Gum! Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle! I don’t use a curling iron. Thanks Monica! What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here. I can smell it a little, bake the pie. Okay. Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?! Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes. Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips. Okay. Okay, I’ll be out in a second. That doesn’t lock does it? Hey! Hi! Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you! Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s. Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you. Yeah she said something about crumbies. Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy! No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink! All right fine! This looks like so much fun. God, what a mess. Well, what kind of guy are you looking for? Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together? Oh, sly. Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12? Hey! Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing. Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo. ‘Cause that’s just your taste. Oh yeah? My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these A chin dimple! Have you seen your guy’s body? Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it. Oh yeah, like there are police for that! I know. Oh, Chandler funny? My guy is well read. My guy has great teeth! Hey! What did you do on yours? Rachel, what the hell is this?! You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own! Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo. So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work? No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people. Well, so do a lot of people. Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay... I gotta go!" Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy. Okay sure! Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions. Okay. Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating. Nothing, you just have to be cool with it. This is Patrick. Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel? This is Patrick. Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it. Yeah? Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. Have a seat. Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money. Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out. Then why did she ask us to... Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you. Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth! You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself! Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!! Oh my God. I am extremely talented! No, I mean I was really acting my ass off. Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me. Fine! I’ll do it without you! I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! You’ll see!! You’ll all see!! I am. Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!! Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it! It's not that bad. Chandler, Chandler. Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this! Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts! OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass. I know! I know! I know! Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!! I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where’d Ross go?" Yeah? He’s holding us back. No! Joey, you’re going to be great! I’ll be waiting. No, I’m just deciding which one to use. I’m gonna start writing another book! Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut. I want to see what he wants first. You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness. Yeah. Not looking for dates. You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower? Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great! And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment. Hey! Well, why don’t you just get him fired? "You wish." I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people. Marcia and Chester. I see what you’re doing! Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter! Hi! I know what time you said. Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said. Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up. I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. Thanks! So are you. Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven. That’s right. Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis. Hi, you guys. Well it’s just... it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum. No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us! Okay that’s so generous! Great! Okay then it’s just us girls! Yeah. It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek! Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we’d be great together! So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet? Hey, and then lunch. Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay? No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right? Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. Me too! I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know? Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay. Don’t even get me started on yours! Yeah? No! Why? Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God! What are you gonna do? Rachel said that! Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" Okay, maybe ask this guy. Well, what did he do? Joey! Well, we should go. Hey, did she buy it? So did Heldi show you the place? I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you! Now, have you told anyone else? You told me. Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet. Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? Yeah, coffeehouse. So how are things going with Paul? That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open. No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone. Watch this. Hi Paul! So how are things going with you? Yeah! That was so weird, huh? I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s... He’s mad at you! Please, I think you know why. Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper. Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for? Well then I think that’s it. Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table. Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or... ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner. Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry? Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out. Or not, whatever. Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it? We will give you $10. We stand firm at $10. Okay. Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything here for $10. I’ll give you $1 for them. Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much? Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something’s missing. It’s not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out. Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! Chandler, I found the perfect ring. Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over! Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail! The little jail between the doors! I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring. Maybe it was the guy. Hey. It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring! Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something. Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring. There he is! Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes. Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call. It is your office. John? Here he is. Wow! I would trade. Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart? Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity.... Hi. What? Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring. Yeah! If she says no, can I have the ring? If! Hi Monica. It’s gone. We’re practically kissing. Open bar? I can do that for the kids. Y’know, you are 12 years older than her. Oh! Oop! Here. So now what’s going on here? No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair? No! It’s nice! Oh, hi. Hey you guys! Look! I got me some drinks! Open bar! You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you? Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.] Well, just buy the damn boat! I’m just helping the kids! Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. Oh, okay. It’s a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table? Oh, enchantée. Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out. What happened? Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor... Good one! Yeah. Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track. Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward! No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!! I know, they’re gonna be so happy together. Not that often! Me too! So happy for them! Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous! Totally. I’m like 90/10. Definitely! What do you mean? You mean a backup? Yeah, yeah I got that. Hm-mmm. Joey. Yeah! Yeah, I locked him years ago! Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were Well hey, it’s just a backup. Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler! I don’t.... Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation! Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married! All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat. This is hard! No wait! Just... Okay Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week. I’m talking about massages. Good! Left! Thank you. Ross! Yeah absolutely! Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
