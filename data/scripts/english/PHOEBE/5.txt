Hi. Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me. Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt? Oh my God! Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother. Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me! Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?! What?! Oh my God, she's so stupid! That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina! All right--Ooh! Oh dead God, save me! I'm having my first contraction! Ooh, it's not bad. Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet! No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice? Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-- Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it. Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder. Hey. It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo! What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie! Hi! And you're going into what grade? Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor. Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go! They are. Why? Happy birthday! I know, it is. Can I tell you a little secret? I want to keep one. Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know! Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know? Oh, just ask him! I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out! You're right. Tell him it's for you. So did you ask him? Well, I'm kinda on a clock here. Undo it. Undo it. Undo it. Hi! Okay, doctor says any minute now. Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do. Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!! What is that? Oh my God! I already had a baby. Leave me alone. Which one do you have? But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know... Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies. So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry. I know. Yeah. You won't be able to take it. They're gonna call her Chandler. Works on you. Ugh, PBS! Ugh, what's right with them? Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back. All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys! This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish. What-what are you talking about?! Yeah. So? Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless. Yeah, it's... Y'know there's...no you may not! Are you calling me selfish?! I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant? Right. I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass! I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right! Ooh-ohh! Why? Yeah. Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life. Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me. Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not. Aw, dammit! Ooh, it's not a toy. Hi Joey. I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200. Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed. No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster. Yeah, not the one I had my eye on. Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel, Oh no! Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there! Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore? Yeah that's better than my way. Can you hear anything? Ooh, Madlibs, mine! I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better. Hey. Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though. Ehh!! Come where? Okay, but try and get Joey too. Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever. Hey! Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention. We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey! The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!" Count for what? Hey! Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud. Eeeee--ohh!! God! Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make! Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green. Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing. I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat. That might work! Why? Hey! So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies. This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do. Nooo!! I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much. Oh, I know. All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I.. it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine! Are you still mad at us? Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song. You're kinda stepping on the song. Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! Yes! Exactly! And that's why.... Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat! Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard! Hi Emily! Here. Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold! Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? It's okay to laugh right? Okay. Yum-my! Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors. Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show! Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda. Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat. Okay. He's so funny! Show me the badge again. Shiny. You are just nonstop! Why?! You have the power to do that? Shut it down. Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down! Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." Ooh, absolutely! Ooh, I love that place! So, no. Enh. Sure! Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That...this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go! Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever? Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose. Does anyone wanna watch TV? Monica your remote doesn't work. Oh. Aw, forget it. Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything. I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse. Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse! Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse. Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new. Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head! Hello? Joey? What's going on? Oh my God! Easy. Step. How did it get on? Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out! Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal. Hey! No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary. All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think. Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it? Oh, I can't believe you called her fat. Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story! Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever. What am I sitting on? Ew-eww!! Undies! Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow. Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam. Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with! Yeah! Okay...ooh, but are you going to have time to read it? This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish. Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street. Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop. Well, he stabbed me first!! Okay. I thought you said you read it in high school. Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy moors in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism. You completely stole my answer! Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it! I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. Would you care to venture one? Are you just repeating what I'm saying? Okay then. Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?! Yeah? Hi! You didn't read this one either?! What? No! You should've read it yourself! Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time. Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights. I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop. Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously. Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school. All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert! What's going on? So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off. I don't know! I didn't come with her! Hey you guys, guess what? Ohh, you and your ways. Since it’s Christmas time. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations. Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket. Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city. Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. Hey! Well, it's going okay. Oh, thanks! Wow! Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive. Just get your nails done? Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. Thank you! And Happy Holidays. Wait, you can't take the money out. But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor. Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still... Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just... Thank you, Happy Holidays. Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash! Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning! Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here. Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you? Does it look like an ashtray? Does it look like a urinal? Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket! Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back, because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here! What?! That chick can't handle my corner. Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask? You too! Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet. Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane. Really?! How come? Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher. Well, I taught me and I love me. Hey! Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you. Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here. Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all. Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?! Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar? Then don't touch one!! Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night? Then do Iceberg! G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God! No, but you're questioning my method! Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid. Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder! Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!! Oh, fine! Take his side! No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages! Uh-huh! No! Yeah! Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended. Bye! Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So... That's weird. I bet they're doing it. Hey! Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase? Exactly! Because it's in the past! Okay, then what happened? Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn! Nothing! This is not over! What?! Hey! What were you doing? Oh, nobody's judging you. You two will have very hairy children. So are you actually gonna see her again? Uh-hmm. Get your foot off my contestant! Judge! Ohhh. Hey! Are you serious?! You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We... No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton! Ohh, tough call. Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital. Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died. It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit. Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse! It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins. Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again. It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter. It's Phoebe. Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in? Umm, well, umm Grandma died. No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow. No you didn't! Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not? Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on. Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag! Thanks! Yeah, welcome. Umm here's your 3-D glasses. So how did you know Francis? Really?! What's your name? You're Frank Buffay? You just said... But... Oh my God! That was my dad! Uh-huh. He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name? Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned! Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma. All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad. Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it. All right. Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?! As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone! He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain! Umm, thank you for meeting with me. Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just...I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay. Okay. Huh? Oh yes. Yes. Yeah...no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick. Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct? Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children? Yeah. See? Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man? What?! But you-you-you came to see Lilly? Lilly's dead. She's dead. Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake. 17 years ago. Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch. Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you! Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there. Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go. That's a defense? You make up songs? Well, I am. Not yet, no. Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes! It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it. Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!! Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!! CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!! OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!! NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!! YOU KNOW?!!! Get in here!!! You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or...Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp! Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better. Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows? Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own. Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do. No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know! Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate. And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality. Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie. Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you! Yeah the material feels so soft...hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out? Well, if you really wanna know, I'm...Oh! I can't tell you this. Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most. I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee...Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will. I have quarters! But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send? Bye Chandler! I miss you already. Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment? He broke that. I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out. Oh? Hello you. Eh? Really? I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more! No! God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything! All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in. Please. So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight. Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven? Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse. Okay, Rachel, get me perfume! And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? Okay. Good idea! Oh now, don't give away the farm! Chandler. I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some? So, here we are. Nervous? No, I want this to happen. Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off! Really? No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me. He's not backing down. He went to get lotion. Joey! Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons. Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra. You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now. Ooh. Here it comes. Our first kiss. And why not?! You're-you're what?! I just...I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love! God! Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything. Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts. Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor. Bread, so you never go hungry. And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know. Yeah! Mr. President. Yeah. I really like his glasses. Oh, hi Ross! Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be. No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit! Hey! Yeah, okay, my bad. That's what I'm saying. Ooh. No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay? Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy. But somehow you came off as the bad guy. Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there. Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already! All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean. Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero. Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week. All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need? Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge! Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? You can't put your cigarette out on a tree! No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again. Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk! Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em. Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree. You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!! Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup! ...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool! I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds. You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. Hey. Excuse me, is this your car? Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. I-I'm with the umm, the 57th. I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore. Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz? Yeah, big guy, kinda bald. Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died. I-I sure will, take care. Oh. Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me! Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it! Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool! I would love it if I weren't here! Me?! Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out! Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer... Gary. Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me? Ohh, impressive. Yeah, we'll talk at dinner. All right, I can't wait! Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it! You wanna work on your interview skills? Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi. Very good handshake, good wrist action. Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler. But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk. Okay, then maybe I can come too! All right, you go. 'Kay, bye! Oh God! Oh I just miss him so much! Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other. So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler? Come on, seriously! When did it end? Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious. God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just...I misspoke. It's okay. Oh we can't, we already have plans. Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie. You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go? Yeah! You tired Chandler? Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here. We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code! What are you talking about?! Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend. Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise. Okay, great so do you want to do it together? Hey! Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee? Oh good! Oh good. Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! Oh, look at that. What happened to the intimate dinner party? So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host. Like what? Cups? You're giving me cups? Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice! I got it! Mine! Hey! Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party? Umm, cups. Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice. Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey! Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical! Oh, look! Look! Look! I was in charge of cups. I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law? Don't get me started on that. Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl. Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian! See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone. This is so cool! But I like it here! Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them. Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed. I guess so. Wait, Rach! Where's the other one? Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?! Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight! These are her earrings. Why not? I found it! On your dresser. Maybe your scene's coming up? This is terrible, what are you going to do? That's not good. But I already gave them back to you! All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring? Make sure you check Chandler's jewelery box. Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?! Why are you being weird? No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?" Ohh! I did not get that. Did you find it? Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me. What are we going to do?! All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all. I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault. Mon, can I talk to you for a sec? Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry! I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible. No. Yeah! You're the best! Oh, right! I-I-I found it interesting. Ross? What else do they add smell too? Oh no! I am definitely gonna watch that! Definitely! Oh, then no. Hey! Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes. Uh-huh! John Glenn is here?! Hi! My God, Joey! Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you. Okay! Bye! Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story. Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey. I'm fine, thanks. Nope. Okay. Bye! So, what movie should we see? What?! Really?! I can't believe this! No, but it is fast. Isn't it? No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this! I don't know. I'll just handle it. I'll ask you to talk to him! Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man! Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing? What?! You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God! Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing. Yeah! Okay. Thanks! Okay. Yeah? Uh-hmm. No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. Yeah? That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other. I just...I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for. I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just... I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake. Which is why my answer is yes! Uh-huh! I'm so...happy. We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay! I know, I'm so excited! Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited! Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in! I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps. No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they? Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out. No, nothing. Yeah. No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. Uh-huh! Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together. Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water? Umm, yeah! Today's. Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging! Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry! Yeah? That's so sweet. Living with you would make me happy. No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you! Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never! I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day. We could have breakfast in bed... Okay. Oh! Oh no. Oh good, you're all up. Oh yeah, that's over. He shot a bird! Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright. Nah, I don't feel like playing. Yeah! Ohh, give him a kiss for me! Bye! I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him! I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons! Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay? You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way? Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it. Ohh-oh, chilling! Oh wait, my grandmother's dead. No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas. Oh hey Joey! What's up? Yeah, I've been around. Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe. Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can. Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites? Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer? Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot? North route or south route? Bamn! There you go! Huh? Oh, this guy again. Umm, no thank you. Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind! Bye! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. Well, if you don't know I can't help you. Well, I can't help you. Apology accepted. Uh-huh. Bye, fat ass. I don't know! I don't remember! Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. No. No that made me feel precious. That game should not be played without my supervision. What's in the bag? I do! Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel! Hey, dude! Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change. No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison. Uh-hmm. Fauna. Garfunkle. You said I was boring--Ohh! Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess! Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream. Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? Okay! Hello? Hey Joey! Sure! Where is it? Ohh! So you're 5639?! Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler? Who was that? Yeah! Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica? It's okay. What the hell took you so long? Which Richard? Richard Simmons?! Oh my God! Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it? That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard. But again, Simmons. Go on. Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler? Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year! Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks! On a totally different bet. Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler. Okay, I'm gonna go too! Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London. Uh-huh, great story! I'm going! Hey! Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?! Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me! Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked. Naked alone time. Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door? So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London? Okay, what about after I give you these candies? Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing. Oh no. Simmons! Go with Simmons! Okay, London 1... Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh! For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi! Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow! Why are you dressed as a gladiator? So you're a gladiator! Wow! Monica had lunch with Richard. Noo! But that would've been so cool! I love Vegas! Thanks. Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry. So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him. Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one! Hey! Yeah? Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up? But she just came up here! I wonder where she is. That is so weird. Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you! Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her. Good. I should really start wearing hats! Hey! You guys are here! Yay! What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget. Yeah! Whoa, what kind of party was this? Ugh! That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing. M-M-Mole people? Oh. What's a lurker? Kills you? Ohhh! How do you know about this? Dance karate? Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get! Ohh! You made up! Ohh, get a room. I know. Use it. Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside! Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over! Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave? What time? Maybe we can share a cab! I won! I won! I finally won! Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! Sells drugs to kids. She sells drugs to kids. How about we talk about this over dinner? No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!! Oh, okay. Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-fax? I must've left it in conference room B. Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world. No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
