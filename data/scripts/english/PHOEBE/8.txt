Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant? We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant——It’s because I am. Yes, I…I am with child. And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder. I can’t say. I can’t say because he’s famous. Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. What?! Well he never said that to me! How about just the bridemaids? It is. Oh my God! So instead you told me Monica was pregnant. Sneaky. Uh-hmm. Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay. Really?! So, are you ready to talk about it? Now? Okay, we’ll talk about something else then. Who’s the father?! Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag? Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop. Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey! Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him. Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin… Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said… What?! Why bother? Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant. When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure. I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure. I’ll run out and get you one. Oh no, she won’t tell us. See? This is why you register. 30 seconds. It’s time. Okay. Umm, it’s negative. It’s negative. Here. No, it’s positive. It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive. Well yeah, I lied before. Now you know how you really feel about it. With who? Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night? Hey! Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler? A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman. Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt! Oh yeah. Okay. Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course. Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor? What?! I think he’s cute. Believe me I’m trying. Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism. Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different. Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam! I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus. Oh yeah. That’s me. Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. David Lynn. Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying. Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet? Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther? Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby… Why not? Bus? Well-well but it is huge. You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of…See? Hey. All right. Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn! I can and I will! Hey! It’s Joey! We don’t know. Who? Who is it? Was that story over? Oh my God! I know who the father is… Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go! I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do? Really? Are you sure? Okay, sorry. Yeah. Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. What?!! No!! I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani. Ooh! A Salami Buddy! Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding? Yeah! Have a great honeymoon! It was his sweater, but—Oh my God! Me too! Yeah, bye. Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon. All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later. What?! They took mine to give to you! Maybe they don’t trust us. You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels? No you didn’t. Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar! What stuff? Did Rachel find you? Oh she was looking for you. Well, she really wanted to talk to you now. What? And? Oh sorry. And?! Maybe it’s something you ate? Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place. Well why don’t you use your key? Oh! We could have done that. Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them. Oh no. Didn’t you two already talk? Holy mother of God!!! That is brand new information!! A little bit. Oh Ross. Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. Okay, we’re in. Hey! So how was the doctor? Good. Oh. Hi! Come on in! So how was the honeymoon? That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger. Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg. You have got to be kidding me! Monica! That’s not right! Start with where. I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex! Greg and Jenny? You got fake numbered. Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects. Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert! That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that! Regina Philange. No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!! You’re gonna get pregnant. Oh, you came on to Ross! Hey! Dinner was good! I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go! Oh, well hello there. I didn’t see this on the menu. Oh, so you're Monica’s boss? Oh! I sous stand. Oh you…you made pesto? Would you say your pesto is the best-o? I made it myself. Well, it’s no pesto. Ooh Monica! Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him. But why?! Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two. But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please? That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too. Love it! Hey! But… Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today. Because I’m dumping him today. He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?" Then he comes over! "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man! You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself. Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself! Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch. Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch! All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! Hi. It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy. Aw. I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I… Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay. Monica! I’m breaking up with you! I’m, I’m breaking up with you. I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now. Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too. And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
