Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead. So? No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Ugh, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors. Oh, Rachel! Oh, yay! Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That's fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time. Trick or treat! Ooh, and treat it is. Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts. Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you? 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces? You smoked! Chandler, you stink of cigarettes. Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a great goddess... I'm gonna go. Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late. I'm starving. I knew we were coming here tonight, so I ate nothing all day. Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing. Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long. One really does have a stick up one's ass, doesn't one. No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I'll cave. Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. . Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order? Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend? Both it is, thank you. You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two? And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma? Where, where have you been? You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order. Aw ... what? It's a good toast. Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now. Well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello? Okay, that was Mike. Huh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, okay, I'm gonna take off. Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye. I know! Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this? I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation. Maybe not, is it? I know Mike, why don't you keep digging? Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars. Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike. Oh no, I want to. Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. It really is. Oh my God! David! No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk? Who cares, it got you here. Wow. Where is your luggage? A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company. Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good. No... I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike? He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no... Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible. Really? Chandler? Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night. I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God! Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am. I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong... Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey. Hey! Okay. No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny... Oof... Oh, wait, wait! No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike. Yeah, I should have told you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I am happy. Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate... I mean... Yeah? Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's... Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad. No, no. No. Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him... And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend. No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days. No, no... Oh, well, yeah... Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go. Okay, well... guys? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand. Right! Never! Never! I swear! Hi! Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's Really? That hadn't occurred to me. They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue! Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two 'Phoebe' So... now... What about with Mike's mom? That's she's like the daughter I'm wearing pantyhose! Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH! Yeah, so...

Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know Oh no, no, no, no, no, ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / Oh, Pervert Parade? Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair? Oh God! Is that veal? Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish Yeah... The woman you what? I love you too... YEAH...!

So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern No-no, we do it every year! No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that Oh no, we have to! Well then, you should look with us. Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah. Ooh ooh, we have a live one! Ooh, who's it for? Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I You guuuyys. Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin? I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash. Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore. You could do that? Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV! Oh, really? Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up? Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse! Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous. Okay, now. What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. Okay, that helps. Hey. So, what did he say? I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor. Joey. Who dies? Yes, doctor. Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming! Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next? Okay, from the top, people! Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe? Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans. Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children. Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him? About what? And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky. Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back. I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process. Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened. Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here! Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru? No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle. What? Oh, whew, no, that's Bob. Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies. What are those? OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob. So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. Hey Mikey What are you doing? To kill Bob?? No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl. I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom! I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl. Oh my god, we killed Bob! Suzie? Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies! I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother. No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them. Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed. Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now. Mate? They're all brothers and sisters. No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do? Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites. You must think I'm crazy. Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I? Well it depends. On how far along he's in the sex change process! Your knuckles are kinda hairy too... Wow! Talking about high maintenance I'm a woman! Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight? But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing? OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing. While drinking... Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there Oh my god. It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper. Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!! "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you! Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing. But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice. All the time when you're cooking. Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy" OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there? Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone Can you totally see through her shirt ? Every little bit of you! Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but... Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands. Yes, she gives the people what they want. Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again. Hey. What you got? Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food. Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too. I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy. I just wish they'd realise they should be together. I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children. You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other. So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people? Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together. Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." Ooh, Joey. Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me. Oh, yeah. A teacher? Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! Yeah. How do you even know a woman like that? Joey. So now what do we do? What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up! Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together. It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... No, I think we killed it. Hello? Hey, Rach! You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned. Did he go out for a cigarette? My dear, sweet Rach. By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan. Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey? How - how do I get them to name the next one after me? Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes. Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working. Don't, don't do the plan-laugh. Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again. Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run! Mexico! What's your news? Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people… come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey! That's great. Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? Oh, I hear divorce bells. No. Lowell, is that you? Oh my god! I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross. Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this! Good for you! Ouh… Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up… I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I… Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer… She was a drug dealer! Okay… Why? You were? Oh my god… No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. Okay, I think we have a problem here. Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- I know… I mugged Ross! Hey, you! Hey, how was class? Nothing, I really wanna know. Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid… You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. Yes, it was. "Gimme your money, punk!" Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say… Really? Even more humiliating than… Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy" I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him Why?? Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you. I want you to stay. Why don't you turn them inside ou... I'll miss you. Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top. Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!" Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together! I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun! Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news. I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before. Okay, well you put down the toilet seat. Uh huh...we're playing you two. Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do. I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom! Yeah! You bet roomy! Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. China patterns!!!!! Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy. Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes. What do you mean? Oh. Wow. Was it really that bad? Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean. But it's just... Oh! No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister! Yeah I get that. Hi Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage. No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it. Mike doesn't ever wanna get married. Never. I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks! That's not how you really feel is it? Seriously? You divorce-o? It's ok that's how you feel. I do love Mike. Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks. It's not cooler. Better. Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you. What do you mean? They are awfully boxy... Uh huh. Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all? Right. Except that I do want to get married. Someday. I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff. Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you. But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen. Are you gonna change yours? Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want. I don't want it to end either. Yeah. Hi. Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike! Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this... Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you. Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that. Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said. That was a test and you just failed. God, I wish Mike were here. I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that. Here. Okay Yes. Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time. You can't have it. No Oh yeah. Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing! You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building. Those are my shoes. Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now. I ordered Chinese food. What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!? I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him. There is a speakerphone on the base unit... Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends? Sit down. Thanks, you look good too. So how's the piano playing going? I've missed you too. I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard? What? Oh, I missed you so much! Who is this? Hey will you get me tickets too? You don't wanna win the lottery? Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight! Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses! I hope I win! One, two, three! Get a room! Oooh, I like that, "daddy" Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me? Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl? Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed. Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together OOOOOHHHHH! OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! . Don't come any closer! No, what's more important, your friends or money? Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets? Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl. What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun. So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember? As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish. Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do. Guys, the drawing is about to start! I'm still looking through mine... You guys, what was the Powerball number again? We won. We won! Don't tear it. I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars! I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this! It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents. I beg to differ . Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her. Hey! Sure! Well, I can't give you a massage, because my license has been revoked again! Well, it was an accident... You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Oh no! You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years! Oh, good! Ok, good for you! Try to recapture the magic! And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing! And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè! Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain! Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home". Yeah. But what? Ok, say no more. : It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh? Hey! Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"! Well... it's not about quality. Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? What are people having, the garlic Martini? Food here at 'Javu'.. will kill you.. the food here at 'Javu' ... will kill you.. You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Get your garlic-peelers off me! Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha! Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? . Oh... Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! I'm sorry too... Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? What is it? I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want? Hi! Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods? Ah, ah. Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out! Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us? And that horrible museum tour! We know about your party Joey. Hey! Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? Hey Ross! Oh, What's the matter? Worse? No. Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe PhD. You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny... Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right? Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him! Exactly! I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!! Ok, that'll be great! Oh, I'll take some of that. No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah. Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets! Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room? Ok! So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie? Why? Who else? You like Joey? Oh my God! Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him? Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right. Yeah. Sure! Oh. Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin? Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me. I didn't say anything yet! I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends. Well, some things are just hard to say to your face. Ooh! We have a problem. Good plan. Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party. Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture. You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room. David? Oh my God! Yeah. What-what are you doing here? What happened? Yeah? Well, it's great that you're back! How are you? Good! Oh, good for you. Mike and I broke up. Really? I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us! Well... no. I'd love to. Ok. Oh, got it, stay upwind of me. I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures. No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die. Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there. Mike?? Who's Mike? That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past! Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time! I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right? Yeah. You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone! Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling! Not Joey. Yeah? Are you leaving "The Supremes"? Wow? Really? That's fantastic! Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." You know, it's every girl's dream! Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna! Sure, ok, yeah. Oh my God, Mike! No, Mike's here. What are you, what are you doing here? No! I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future. David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong. Yes! Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on! ... and...? All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score! Nobody wins! Yeah, I'm out. Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing! No idea! I though he was soft like you! Monica, you call it. Tails! He was a lawyer! Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now? C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head! I sleep with him! Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back. Mike wins? You can't do that! Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister. It's like watching porn!
