МОНИКА: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Monica? What time is it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, 9. 
ДЖОУИ: But it's dark out. 
МОНИКА: Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like. 
ДЖОУИ: I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. 
МОНИКА: I'm really getting tired of sneaking around. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time. 
МОНИКА: All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. 
МОНИКА: Wait! What about Joey? 
МОНИКА: Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey. 
ФИБИ: Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there! 
МОНИКА: Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference. 
РОСС: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
РОСС: Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her. 
МОНИКА: No, she's out shopping. 
РОСС: Damn! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's going on? 
РОСС: I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it. 
ФИБИ: Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore? 
РОСС: Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. 
МОНИКА: Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work? 
РОСС: I have no idea. I mean. But-but I assure you I will figure it out. 
ДЖОУИ: Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, guys! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's going on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're flipping Monica's mattress. 
ДЖОУИ: So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it. 
ФИБИ: Yeah that's better than my way. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aww, man! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh look! A letter from my mom. 
РОСС: So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! I know. 
ФИБИ: Can you hear anything? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?" 
МОНИКА: Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here. 
МОНИКА: Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, Madlibs, mine! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Condoms? 
ДЖОУИ: You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And condoms are the way to do that? 
РОСС: Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily..... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! My dog died! 
РОСС: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog! 
РОСС: Le Poo's still alive?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God. 
МОНИКА: Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's Le Poo. 
ФИБИ: I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe it! We're here! 
МОНИКА: Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere. 
МОНИКА: Come here. Okay, be right back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on! 
МОНИКА: We're switching rooms. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh dear God, they gave us glasses! 
МОНИКА: No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! 
РОСС: Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! 
РОСС: Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing. Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: You're nose is bleeding! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? 
РОСС: Umm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry. Sorry. 
РОСС: Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either. 
НЕДРУГ: I think you'll find this room more to your liking. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, great. 
НЕДРУГ: They say he's only got half a tank left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! 
МОНИКА: We're switching rooms again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Why? 
МОНИКА: This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room. 
НЕДРУГ: Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you. 
МОНИКА: Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh. 
МОНИКА: Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. 
МОНИКА: Okay, this one I like! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming! 
МОНИКА: Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun? 
МОНИКА: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? 
МОНИКА: I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do not speak ill of the dead. 
МОНИКА: We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom. 
МОНИКА: What did you say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn." 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
РОСС: Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, what's up? 
РОСС: Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants. 
РОСС: And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
РОСС: ...is for me not to see you anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? 
РОСС: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died! 
РОСС: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. 
РОСС: What are you doing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Storming out! 
РОСС: Rachel, this is your apartment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Damn Rollos! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you're back! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: How was your conference? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, so your weekend was a total bust? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator. 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you're back too! 
МОНИКА: Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how was your chef thing? 
МОНИКА: Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea. 
МОНИКА: Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica. 
МОНИКА: Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, fine, $300. 
МОНИКА: 300 dollars?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room! 
МОНИКА: Urghh!! 
ДЖОУИ: What are you guys woofing about? 
МОНИКА: Chandler stole a twenty from my purse! 
ДЖОУИ: Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots! 
РОСС: You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do. 
ДЖОУИ: You want my advice? 
РОСС: Yes! Please! 
ДЖОУИ: You're not gonna like it. 
РОСС: That's okay. 
ДЖОУИ: You got married too fast. 
РОСС: That's not advice! 
ДЖОУИ: I told ya. 
РОСС: I'm going to the bathroom. 
ДЖОУИ: Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, me either. 
МОНИКА: Maybe I could do it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi, Rach. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right? 
ДЖОУИ: I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's not Ross! 
ФИБИ: Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, Ross is in the bathroom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you're not Kip! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you even know who Kip is? 
ДЖОУИ: Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, that poor bastard. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out! 
МОНИКА: You're not gonna be phased out! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go. 
ФИБИ: Ehh!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes that was mine. 
ДЖОУИ: 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes that would have made more sense. 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me! 
ФИБИ: Come where? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones. 
ФИБИ: Okay, but try and get Joey too. 
РОСС: Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec? 
ФИБИ: Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever. 
РОСС: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules? 
РОСС: I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross... 
РОСС: No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you. 
РОСС: Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding! 
РОСС: I can't believe this is happening. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. 
РОСС: I am so sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know that too. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, it did. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, I guess this is over. 
МОНИКА: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime. 
МОНИКА: Why, exactly? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because of the weekend, we had a fight. 
МОНИКА: Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than... Ohhh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, this isn't over? 
МОНИКА: You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Okay. Great! 
МОНИКА: Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're in a relationship? 
МОНИКА: I'm afraid so. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator. 
МОНИКА: Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it's in there. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Ohh! Oh!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, can I talk to you for a second? 
ДЖОУИ: Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!! 
ДЖОУИ: Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. Yes. 
ДЖОУИ: You?! And-and you?! 
МОНИКА: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows! 
ДЖОУИ: How?! When?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It happened in London. 
ДЖОУИ: IN LONDON!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. 
ДЖОУИ: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no-no! You can't! 
МОНИКА: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell. 
ДЖОУИ: All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but... 
МОНИКА: I know, it's great! 
ДЖОУИ: Aww, I don't want to see that! 
ФИБИ: We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey! 
ФИБИ: The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!" 
МОНИКА: Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count. 
ФИБИ: Count for what? 
МОНИКА: Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs. 
ДЖОУИ: I guess I'm done. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fun's over! 
МОНИКА: Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh! 
ДЖОУИ: I think I'm gonna take-off. 
МОНИКА: Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
