МОНИКА: I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn! 
МОНИКА: That was a half an hour? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's your timer. 
МОНИКА: Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, then massage me up right nice! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!! 
МОНИКА: It's so good, isn't it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it! 
МОНИКА: Say good-bye to sore muscles! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good-bye muscles!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just...I didn't know what it was! 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth. 
РОСС: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! 
РОСС: Sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the bunny got away. 
РОСС: This would be the place where you explain the hat. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you're gonna make them all disappear. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Done. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out. 
ДЖОУИ: Great! Thanks, Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure! God, please take those off! 
ДЖОУИ: All right. 
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, how's it going? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
РОСС: Is everything okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Are you all right? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died. 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! Sorry! 
ФИБИ: It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse! 
МОНИКА: Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside. 
РОСС: Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died. 
МОНИКА: Ohh my God, I'm so sorry. 
ФИБИ: It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins. 
МОНИКА: Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die? 
ФИБИ: Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again. 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, I'm so sorry. 
ФИБИ: It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear? 
ДЖОУИ: All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? A purse? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag. 
ДЖОУИ: It looks like a women's purse. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag. 
ДЖОУИ: See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Exactly! Unisex! 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I ain't gonna say no to that. 
НЕДРУГ: Who is it? 
ФИБИ: It's Phoebe. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up? 
ФИБИ: Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, yeah...no thanks. 
ФИБИ: Umm, well, umm Grandma died. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago? 
ФИБИ: No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I know that I went to that all ready. 
ФИБИ: No you didn't! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, then who's been dead for five years? 
ФИБИ: Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left. 
ФИБИ: Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks! Enjoy your funeral. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani! 
ДЖОУИ: What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! 
РОСС: Your make-up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it. 
ДЖОУИ: Why would I return it? I love this bag! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, then you owe me $350. 
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you. 
РОСС: What's the part, Anti-man? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy. 
ДЖОУИ: U-N-I-sexy? 
ФИБИ: Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi sweetie! 
РОСС: Hey, how are you holding up? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry. 
ФИБИ: Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag! 
ДЖОУИ: Here, I brought you some flowers. 
ФИБИ: Thanks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine. 
НЕДРУГ: Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, welcome. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello. Hello. 
ФИБИ: Umm here's your 3-D glasses. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, umm, all right. 
ФИБИ: So how did you know Francis? 
НЕДРУГ: Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter. 
ФИБИ: Really?! What's your name? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Frank Buffay. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill. 
ФИБИ: You're Frank Buffay? 
НЕДРУГ: Shh! No! Joe Hill! 
ФИБИ: You just said... 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming. 
ФИБИ: But... 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: What?! What honey? 
РОСС: What happened? 
ФИБИ: That was my dad! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me. 
МОНИКА: Oh, did you catch him?! 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: Wh-what did he say?! 
ФИБИ: He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?! Why not?! 
ФИБИ: Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned! 
ДЖОУИ: What did you say to him? 
ФИБИ: Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. 
НЕДРУГ: Could everyone please take their seats? 
ФИБИ: All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: All right, let's go say good-bye. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And a date with a man! 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag! 
ФИБИ: All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are? 
ФИБИ: Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out 
РОСС: Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself. 
МОНИКА: Well, at least you scared someone. 
ФИБИ: Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. 
ФИБИ: All right. 
ФИБИ: Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?! 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? 
ФИБИ: As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone! 
МОНИКА: I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! 
ФИБИ: He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain! 
МОНИКА: No he's not! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, he is! 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww! 
МОНИКА: You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that. 
РОСС: Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings. 
МОНИКА: But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society. 
НЕДРУГ: Any time you're ready, Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should...I'm sorry, can I ask you something? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. What? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, first it's not a purse. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, anytime. 
ДЖОУИ: I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag! 
НЕДРУГ: Okayyyy! Anddd, go! 
ДЖОУИ: All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them! 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, do you sell these bags? 
ДЖОУИ: Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! Thank you! That was great! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah but I didn’t read anything. 
НЕДРУГ: I think we've seen enough! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, is Rachel here? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em. 
МОНИКА: Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me...just say, "I don't like your massages." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't like your massages. 
МОНИКА: See? It's no big deal. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but now see you're crying! 
МОНИКА: I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You don't know me at all! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you give the worst massages in the world. 
МОНИКА: I'm crying here!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you. 
МОНИКА: Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes! 
МОНИКА: So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Absolutely! 
МОНИКА: Okay. I suck! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Umm, thank you for meeting with me. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. All right. 
ФИБИ: Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just...I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: So, what did Francis leave me? 
ФИБИ: Huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right? 
ФИБИ: Oh yes. Yes. Yeah...no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's...ew used. Umm, cool. 
ФИБИ: Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, yes I was. 
ФИБИ: Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children? 
НЕДРУГ: It really says that?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah. See? 
НЕДРУГ: Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C. 
ФИБИ: Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man? 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please? 
ФИБИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please? 
ФИБИ: But you-you-you came to see Lilly? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah. Why? 
ФИБИ: Lilly's dead. 
НЕДРУГ: She what?! 
ФИБИ: She's dead. 
НЕДРУГ: Are you sure? 
ФИБИ: Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake. 
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe this. I just...I can't believe this. How-how... Oh my God. How long ago? 
ФИБИ: 17 years ago. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! What about, what about the girls? 
ФИБИ: Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch. 
ФИБИ: Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you! 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty. 
ФИБИ: Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there. 
НЕДРУГ: So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left? 
ФИБИ: Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father. 
ФИБИ: That's a defense? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to help you sleep, but that made you cry even more! 
ФИБИ: You make up songs? 
НЕДРУГ: Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm. 
НЕДРУГ: I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm... 
ФИБИ: Well, I am. 
ФИБИ: Not yet, no. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey man, how did the audition go? 
ДЖОУИ: Estelle said I didn't get it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. 
РОСС: What kind of problem? 
ДЖОУИ: Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
РОСС: Nooooo! 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway! 
МОНИКА: Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag. 
ДЖОУИ: I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag. 
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe I'm hearing this! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just...it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
