РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Joey!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe you would say that! 
ДЖОУИ: Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want...I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is he romantic with her? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are they in love? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don't know anything. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, I know one thing! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: They did it right there on the couch. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily! 
НЕДРУГ: What? Oh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry man. 
НЕДРУГ: Here's your scone. 
РОСС: Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did they teach you that in your anger management class? 
ФИБИ: Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that. 
ФИБИ: Exactly! Because it's in the past! 
ДЖОУИ: Anybody gonna eat that? 
МОНИКА: Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party. 
МОНИКА: I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I can do this. 
МОНИКА: Ooh, and I can do this. 
НЕДРУГ: We can't do that. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica. 
МОНИКА: Hi, nice to meet you! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! And this is my wife Kara. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! 
НЕДРУГ: Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, sir. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. 
МОНИКА: What was that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: That noise you just made? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that was my work laugh. 
МОНИКА: Really? Your work laugh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too. 
МОНИКА: All right, check me out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: ....says $30 Father; same as in town. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet. 
МОНИКА: Hey, I thought you already had one. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, good luck with that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's up?! 
МОНИКА: What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you? 
МОНИКА: Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything! 
МОНИКА: Okay. Umm... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships! 
МОНИКА: Okay, what's going on with you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing! You go! 
МОНИКА: Well, I-I...there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if...are you sure there's just not anything else? 
МОНИКА: Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! If there was I wouldn't tell you. 
ФИБИ: Okay, then what happened? 
ФИБИ: Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn! 
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, what's going on? 
ФИБИ: Nothing! This is not over! 
РОСС: No! No! No! 
ФИБИ: What?! 
РОСС: I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks! 
ДЖОУИ: All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? 
РОСС: Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? 
РОСС: Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. 
РОСС: That's okay, Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, let's go Pheebs. 
РОСС: Oh God! 
НЕДРУГ: Bing! 
НЕДРУГ: Oww!! 
МОНИКА: Game! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not all right. 
НЕДРУГ: We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water. 
МОНИКА: Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game. 
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let them win one. 
МОНИКА: Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not even giving them a chance! 
МОНИКА: They have racquets don't they?! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win! 
МОНИКА: I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oopsey, missed it! 
МОНИКА: I got it! 
НЕДРУГ: Nice shot. 
МОНИКА: I got it!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Long! 
МОНИКА: I can't believe you let them win! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. 
МОНИКА: I was frustrated. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was my racquet. 
МОНИКА: I was frustrated with you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what really bothers me? Is...it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight. 
МОНИКА: I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe we should check the trash chute. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute. 
ДЖОУИ: That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There he is! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!! 
РОСС: Just, y'know out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there! 
ФИБИ: What were you doing? 
РОСС: I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You walked around all night in the city by yourself? 
ДЖОУИ: He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. 
РОСС: Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want! 
ДЖОУИ: He hooked up!! Tell us about her! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! No that's what I was thinking. 
НЕДРУГ: So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me. 
ФИБИ: Oh, nobody's judging you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! 
РОСС: Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say... 
ФИБИ: You two will have very hairy children. 
РОСС: Okay, I didn't know you would say that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! Janice?! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind. 
РОСС: Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids. 
ФИБИ: So are you actually gonna see her again? 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! 
РОСС: I am gonna see her again. 
ДЖОУИ: Damnit Phoebe!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go! 
МОНИКА: My turn? What-what are you talking about? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big." 
МОНИКА: Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. 
МОНИКА: Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big.....ot. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
МОНИКА: Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. 
МОНИКА: Me and Chandler?! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay? 
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off! 
ФИБИ: Get your foot off my contestant! Judge! 
ДЖОУИ: Judge rules, no violation. 
ФИБИ: Ohhh. 
РОСС: Hey guys! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
РОСС: Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
ФИБИ: Are you serious?! 
РОСС: Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention. 
ФИБИ: You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We... 
ДЖОУИ: And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter! 
ФИБИ: No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton! 
ДЖОУИ: Judge rules, Nutter-Butter. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, tough call. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill. 
НЕДРУГ: So how do you kids like your coffee? 
МОНИКА: Oh, none for me. Thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just a little bit of sugar. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? 
МОНИКА: How does that laugh not give you a headache? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you get used to it. 
МОНИКА: Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal? 
МОНИКА: I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
НЕДРУГ: The joke Bing. What's the matter with you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I just... 
МОНИКА: Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think I do! Thank you, Monica. 
МОНИКА: I thought you could use the help. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Coffee in a fight! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure! Why? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?! 
МОНИКА: Sorry! I'm just...I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But we're not ready to tell yet! 
МОНИКА: I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend. 
МОНИКА: Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hi! 
МОНИКА: Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.] 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I was actually...I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better. 
МОНИКА: Okay great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money. 
МОНИКА: Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: I'll get back to my new job. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 'Kay. Congratulations on your new job. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, she is really gullible. 
НЕДРУГ: Here you go. 
РОСС: Thanks! 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I should get going. 
РОСС: Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Yes! You did! 
РОСС: Oh... 
НЕДРУГ: What is wrong now?! 
РОСС: This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then... 
НЕДРУГ: I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee...ahh!! Ross, we need to talk. 
РОСС: Okay. Sometimes I feel... 
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun. 
РОСС: Huh? 
НЕДРУГ: You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!! 
РОСС: Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice. 
НЕДРУГ: Well yeah!! 
РОСС: OH...MY...GOD!! 
НЕДРУГ: Are you gonna be okay? 
РОСС: I am now. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Umm, hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. 
РОСС: Dude, we got to talk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
РОСС: I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would I be mad? 
РОСС: Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you. 
РОСС: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free! 
РОСС: All right. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down...let's write it down!
