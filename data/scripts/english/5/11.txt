НЕДРУГ: Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing? 
ДЖОУИ: All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're very happy for you. 
ДЖОУИ: What's the matter?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know... 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I'll take care of it. 
МОНИКА: Oh no, wait! Joey! 
РОСС: 73! 72! 71! 
ДЖОУИ: Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe? 
РОСС: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister. 
РОСС: Well, who's gonna kiss my sister. 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler. 
РОСС: Awww, man! Really? 
ДЖОУИ: Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler? 
РОСС: That's a good point. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, great! 
РОСС: All right. 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight! 
ФИБИ: It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask? 
ДЖОУИ: Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So? 
ДЖОУИ: So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, good point. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy New Year! 
МОНИКА: Happy New Year. 
РОСС: Happy New Year, Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: You too! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Happy New Year, Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: So did that do anything for ya? 
РОСС: Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But your divorce isn't even final yet. 
РОСС: Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you want us to leave the room, or? 
РОСС: Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution. 
ФИБИ: Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths. 
ФИБИ: Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane. 
МОНИКА: She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us. 
РОСС: In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar. 
РОСС: Ohh. 
ФИБИ: Really?! How come? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true. 
ФИБИ: Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? Who-who have you taught? 
ФИБИ: Well, I taught me and I love me. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about. 
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't gossip! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip? 
МОНИКА: Well if Ted Kopel talked about his co-workers botched boob jobs, I would. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? They were like this! 
НЕДРУГ: I'll see you tomorrow. 
РОСС: Okay! Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РОСС: I just asked that girl out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice! 
ДЖОУИ: Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today? 
РОСС: Yes it is. See. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Elizabeth Hornswoggle? 
РОСС: That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Horn-swoggle. 
ДЖОУИ: You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! 
РОСС: Hi, Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle. 
ФИБИ: Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you. 
РОСС: All right, see you later. 
ДЖОУИ: See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here. 
ДЖОУИ: Umm, okay. 
ФИБИ: Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular. 
ФИБИ: Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn’t! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and.... 
ФИБИ: Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?! 
ДЖОУИ: No. 
ФИБИ: Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar? 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! 
ФИБИ: Then don't touch one!! 
РОСС: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Hi Ben! 
НЕДРУГ: Auntie Monica!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think they're very nice. 
МОНИКА: I like 'em. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: I like them a lot. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area. 
РОСС: Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on!! 
РОСС: Okay, seriously, what do you think? 
ДЖОУИ: You look like a freak. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awful, absolutely awful. 
РОСС: What are you, what are you doing? 
МОНИКА: It's my New Year's resolution! 
РОСС: What, to blind my child? 
МОНИКА: No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. 
РОСС: My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РОСС: Okay, it must just be me then. 
РОСС: That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom? 
НЕДРУГ: No, go ahead. 
РОСС: Thanks. 
РОСС: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh………. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, my favorite part is coming up! 
РОСС: 'Kay! 
РОСС: Oh my God! 
ФИБИ: Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night? 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Yes, I did. 
ФИБИ: Then do Iceberg! 
ДЖОУИ: G-sharp. 
ФИБИ: G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! I didn't touch a guitar! 
ФИБИ: No, but you're questioning my method! 
ДЖОУИ: No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?! 
МОНИКА: Thank you. 
ФИБИ: Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid. 
ДЖОУИ: Your other student, was you! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! 
ФИБИ: Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: "Baddest man in the whole damn town." 
ФИБИ: Oh, fine! Take his side! 
МОНИКА: I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 
МОНИКА: Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Arghh!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hello? 
РОСС: Joey, it's Ross! I need some help! 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, Chandler's not here. 
РОСС: Well, you can help me! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
РОСС: Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom... 
ДЖОУИ: Nice! 
РОСС: No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder? 
РОСС: Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! 
ДЖОУИ: Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up. 
РОСС: Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man. 
ДЖОУИ: Umm, do you see any...oh, Vaseline? 
РОСС: Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there. 
РОСС: Hold on. 
ДЖОУИ: Ross? You okay? 
РОСС: They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste! 
ДЖОУИ: Really?! Uhh, what color is it? 
РОСС: What difference does that make?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm just...if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, do you have a minute? 
РОСС: Dude, what am I gonna... 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey, I have such a problem! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something! 
ДЖОУИ: What-what is it, what is it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable! 
ДЖОУИ: I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they? 
ДЖОУИ: And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone... 
ДЖОУИ: I'm not listening to you! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out. 
РОСС: All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off. 
НЕДРУГ: No, let's just leave the lights on. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
РОСС: I had a problem. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Cool! 
ДЖОУИ: Was the chord at least right... 
ФИБИ: No! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry. 
РОСС: This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit! 
НЕДРУГ: No. No, you're not a loser. 
РОСС: Look at me! 
МОНИКА: Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy! 
РОСС: Oh, be-because of the leather pants. 
МОНИКА: See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That really is something; that's really cool. 
ДЖОУИ: Howdy partner! 
РОСС: Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy. 
МОНИКА: Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good luck, honey! 
ФИБИ: Bye! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, uh, Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: Umm? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me? 
ДЖОУИ: Now? You want me to go over there now? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Do you know something? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you know something? 
ДЖОУИ: I might know something. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I might know something too. 
ДЖОУИ: What's the thing you know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know. 
ДЖОУИ: I can't tell you what I know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then I can't tell you what I know. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, fine. 
ДЖОУИ: You don't know! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! 
ДЖОУИ: YOU KNOW!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: AND YOU KNOW!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I know!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known? 
ДЖОУИ: Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen.... 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So... 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh, yeah, me too. 
ФИБИ: That's weird. I bet they're doing it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross,there was a phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
