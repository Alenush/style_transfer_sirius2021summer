ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: What are you guys doing up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red? 
ДЖОУИ: Dark red. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon? 
МОНИКА: Yes, you are so smart! 
ДЖОУИ: Aww, you guys are so cute! 
МОНИКА: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I'll see you in the morning. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey! 
НЕДРУГ: Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but... 
НЕДРУГ: Cat. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! You are so smart! I love you. 
НЕДРУГ: I love you too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, we still need a tip. 
ФИБИ: All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A couple of bucks. 
ФИБИ: Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge! 
МОНИКА: Wow! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you guys! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey! 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt? 
МОНИКА: Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him. 
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica! 
МОНИКА: Are you saying I smell bad? 
ДЖОУИ: No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry. 
МОНИКА: What's with him? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! 
РОСС: Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! You say that to kids?!! 
РОСС: No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch. 
НЕДРУГ: You picked a great couch. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? 
РОСС: Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away! 
РОСС: Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Are you kiddin'? 
РОСС: Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh! I can do it! 
РОСС: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: You two are really gonna enjoy that couch. 
РОСС: Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! 
РОСС: What's that supposed to mean? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! 
НЕДРУГ: Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know. 
РОСС: Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? You two? 
РОСС: Yeah! Rach? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch. 
РОСС: Then tell him quickly. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine! We went out. 
РОСС: Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser! 
РОСС: A loser you did it with 298 times! 
ФИБИ: Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes? 
ФИБИ: You can't put your cigarette out on a tree! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah I can, it worked real well. 
ФИБИ: No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again. 
НЕДРУГ: I won't! Until I have my next cigarette. 
ФИБИ: Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk! 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em. 
НЕДРУГ: Who are you talking too? 
ФИБИ: Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree. 
НЕДРУГ: I am not going to apologize to a tree! 
ФИБИ: You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!! 
НЕДРУГ: I-I'm sorry! Sorry. 
ФИБИ: Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup! 
РОСС: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? 
РОСС: Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go. 
РОСС: Okay, go left. Left! Left! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! 
РОСС: Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Good-good-good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh! 
РОСС: Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Any chance you think the couch looks good there? 
ФИБИ: ...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back! 
ФИБИ: I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested. 
ФИБИ: You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here. 
МОНИКА: Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! Why?! 
МОНИКА: What is going on with you? 
ДЖОУИ: Nothing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day! 
ДЖОУИ: All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, it involved Monica. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream? 
ДЖОУИ: Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. 
МОНИКА: What was the dream about? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out. 
МОНИКА: Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me! 
ДЖОУИ: It-it doesn’t? 
МОНИКА: No! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud. 
ДЖОУИ: That kinda sounds like your dream dude. 
МОНИКА: Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too. 
ДЖОУИ: In the dream I did enjoy the closeness. 
МОНИКА: Um-hmm. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her? 
ДЖОУИ: Not really. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well there you have it! 
МОНИКА: Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend! 
ДЖОУИ: No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it? 
ДЖОУИ: Friends first? That's interesting. 
МОНИКА: You become friends after? 
ДЖОУИ: No, never done that either. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom. 
МОНИКА: That's right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's up Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: How you doin'? 
ФИБИ: Excuse me, is this your car? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. 
НЕДРУГ: Don't worry about it. It's not a problem. 
ФИБИ: Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. 
НЕДРУГ: So am I! 
ФИБИ: Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with? 
ФИБИ: I-I'm with the umm, the 57th. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there. 
ФИБИ: I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore. 
НЕДРУГ: Who-who else is in vice up there? 
ФИБИ: Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz? 
НЕДРУГ: Sipowicz? No, I don't think so. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, big guy, kinda bald. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I don't know him. 
ФИБИ: Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss. 
ФИБИ: I-I sure will, take care. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge? 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's up Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: ...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you saying? 
ДЖОУИ: I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up. 
ДЖОУИ: I'll treat you real nice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends! 
ДЖОУИ: Won't-won't that take longer? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first! 
РОСС: Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. 
РОСС: Oh great! What, you brought Joey? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I brought the next best thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РОСС: Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so... 
РОСС: Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? 
РОСС: Oh, that's me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself. 
РОСС: No! That's-that's my arm! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch. 
РОСС: Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
РОСС: Come on, Chandler. 
РОСС: All right. Okay, here we go! 
РОСС: All right, ready? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
РОСС: Turn. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
РОСС: Turn! Turn! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit. 
РОСС: Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!! 
РОСС: Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore. 
НЕДРУГ: You think?! 
РОСС: All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now. 
РОСС: I can't believe that didn't work! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed. 
МОНИКА: Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first! 
ДЖОУИ: Well look, hey, it's all your fault! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Why?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate! 
МОНИКА: What about the closeness? 
ДЖОУИ: Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud! 
ДЖОУИ: All right! Hey, who wants pizza?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, I do! I do! I do! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor? 
МОНИКА: Who is it? 
НЕДРУГ: N.Y.P.D!! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, just a minute officer!! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?! 
ФИБИ: Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right? 
ФИБИ: Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool! 
НЕДРУГ: I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here. 
ФИБИ: I would love it if I weren't here! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me? 
ФИБИ: Me?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice! 
ФИБИ: Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me. 
ФИБИ: Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer... 
НЕДРУГ: Gary. 
ФИБИ: Gary. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, so it's a date. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me? 
НЕДРУГ: Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, impressive. 
НЕДРУГ: Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, we'll talk at dinner. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up? 
ФИБИ: All right, I can't wait! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He has a gun! 
РОСС: I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it. 
НЕДРУГ: You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half! 
РОСС: That's what I'm telling you. 
НЕДРУГ: Did you cut this couch in half? 
РОСС: This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half! 
НЕДРУГ: You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?! 
РОСС: Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars. 
РОСС: I take it.
