ДЖОУИ: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof! 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: I can hear that! 
МОНИКА: Rachel's at work. 
ДЖОУИ: I can still hear you! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello! 
МОНИКА: Hey, what's that? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud. 
ФИБИ: Eeeee--ohh!! God! 
ДЖОУИ: Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up! 
РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here. 
РОСС: How come? Everybody else does. 
НЕДРУГ: You can't. 
МОНИКА: What is that? 
РОСС: Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things. 
МОНИКА: This is all of your things. 
РОСС: Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's...Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new. 
МОНИКА: So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever- used sale. 
РОСС: Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll take it all. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Ross, you're okay with that? 
РОСС: Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? 
РОСС: After what I did? Can you blame her? 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green. 
ДЖОУИ: What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies? 
МОНИКА: Now calm down Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence... 
МОНИКА: Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that? 
ДЖОУИ: No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please? 
МОНИКА: Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I want the little round waffles. 
МОНИКА: All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Arghhhh!!!!!! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him! 
ФИБИ: I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat. 
ДЖОУИ: I'll take it! 
ФИБИ: That might work! 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. 
РОСС: No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. 
ДЖОУИ: What's the matter Ross? 
РОСС: Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo! 
ФИБИ: Why? 
РОСС: Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other. 
ДЖОУИ: That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you're really okay with this? 
РОСС: Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum. 
ДЖОУИ: Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys! You guys! 
МОНИКА: We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something! 
МОНИКА: And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass! 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you fogged Danny. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny? 
ДЖОУИ: Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. 
МОНИКА: Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you. 
МОНИКА: We're-we're really sorry we fogged you. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Yesss? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: O-kay! 
МОНИКА: Wow! That guy is so rude! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you. 
МОНИКА: Well you did a little bit. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry! 
МОНИКА: I totally forgive you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
МОНИКА: Yes! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? 
МОНИКА: Crematorium Chris? Sure! 
ФИБИ: He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts! 
МОНИКА: Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion! 
ФИБИ: This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do. 
РОСС: I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, what is in here? Rocks? 
РОСС: No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, rocks. 
РОСС: I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little? 
РОСС: I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? 
РОСС: Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice... 
ДЖОУИ: You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?! 
РОСС: Why? 
ДЖОУИ: It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. 
РОСС: What's going on? 
ДЖОУИ: We all hate Emily! 
ФИБИ: Nooo!! 
МОНИКА: No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Yes! Unreasonable! 
РОСС: Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! 
ФИБИ: I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much. 
МОНИКА: God, I feel so guilty about Ross. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I know. 
ДЖОУИ: I kinda feel like it's my fault. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think it's very brave what you said. 
ФИБИ: All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing? 
ФИБИ: Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I.. it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: So you like the short hair better. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Yeti....I mean Danny? 
НЕДРУГ: I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so. Y'know. 
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: That's cool. Cool. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me! 
НЕДРУГ: Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here! 
НЕДРУГ: Do you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And stop saying that! I hate that! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you? 
НЕДРУГ: The pizza-place across the street any good? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Stop saying that. I hate that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Ross? 
ФИБИ: Are you still mad at us? 
РОСС: Yep. 
ФИБИ: Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song. 
РОСС: Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we are so sorry. 
ФИБИ: You're kinda stepping on the song. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you. 
МОНИКА: Whatever you decide, whatever you do. 
ФИБИ: Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! 
РОСС: Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now. 
ФИБИ: Yes! Exactly! And that's why.... 
МОНИКА: Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner. 
РОСС: Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur? 
ФИБИ: Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today. 
РОСС: You do, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone.... 
РОСС: What are you talking about? 
ДЖОУИ: I'm not sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Hey, look at you! Where have you been? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny. 
МОНИКА: How did that happen? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That yeti is one smooth talker. 
МОНИКА: I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room. 
НЕДРУГ: No! Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really, I don't mind. 
РОСС: Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh.. It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I.... 
ДЖОУИ: RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor.... 
РОСС: Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I haven't seen him in so long! 
ФИБИ: Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard! 
МОНИКА: Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together. 
ДЖОУИ: It's almost as if he knew. 
МОНИКА: I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. 
РОСС: Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on. 
ФИБИ: Hi Emily! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too? 
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now. 
РОСС: Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! 
НЕДРУГ: She's there?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, there-there she is! 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, she's here. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, take me off speakerphone. 
РОСС: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear! 
РОСС: Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay? 
НЕДРУГ: You obviously can't keep away from her. 
РОСС: Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time. 
РОСС: Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me. 
НЕДРУГ: You're right. 
РОСС: So, can you trust me? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ДЖОУИ: I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling. 
МОНИКА: How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head! 
ДЖОУИ: You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile! 
РОСС: Well, I guess that's it. 
НЕДРУГ: Why, what happened? 
ДЖОУИ: What happened? What happened? 
РОСС: My marriage is over. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
МОНИКА: Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering. 
ФИБИ: Here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, honey, is there anything we can do? 
РОСС: Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther. 
ФИБИ: Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
