ФИБИ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
ФИБИ: Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Have you started having contractions? 
ФИБИ: Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt? 
НЕДРУГ: Well? 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
РОСС: It's all right. 
НЕДРУГ: Now, which of you is the father? 
ФИБИ: Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts? 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me! 
РОСС: Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did! 
МОНИКА: Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You-you're not wearing a jacket. 
МОНИКА: Oh man! I did it again! 
ФИБИ: Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?! 
ДЖОУИ: I gotta get the before shot! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
РОСС: Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, she's so stupid! 
РОСС: Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay. 
ФИБИ: That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful. 
РОСС: Yeah, he's head of the department. 
ФИБИ: All right--Ooh! Oh dead God, save me! 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: I'm having my first contraction! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, it's not bad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! You okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, something hurts! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet! 
ДЖОУИ: Are they? I didn't know I cared that much. 
РОСС: Hello. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did he just say, he loves Fonzie? 
МОНИКА: That's what it sounded like. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right? 
ФИБИ: No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They're male nurses. 
ДЖОУИ: Not in my head. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say? 
МОНИКА: Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go. 
МОНИКА: Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: Harder than it sounds. Isn't it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them. 
ДЖОУИ: Yep! There's always room for Jell-O! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, how do you make that dirty? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad. 
ДЖОУИ: Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies. Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-- Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it. 
РОСС: Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Male nurses? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I was bummed too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So they're going on dates? When? 
ДЖОУИ: I think Saturday--. 
НЕДРУГ: What's with him? 
ФИБИ: Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: It's not that weird, is it? 
ФИБИ: It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo! 
РОСС: To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie. 
ФИБИ: What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie! 
РОСС: Again, it's not that he... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are! 
МОНИКА: Umm, listen there's something I think you should know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around. 
МОНИКА: Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine! Maybe I will too! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up! 
РОСС: Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang. 
ФИБИ: Hi! And you're going into what grade? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, I'm fully qualified to... 
ФИБИ: Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh cool! You made him cry! 
НЕДРУГ: Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones. 
ДЖОУИ: Umm, well, what else could it be? 
НЕДРУГ: It's kidney stones. 
ДЖОУИ: Or? 
НЕДРУГ: Kidney stones! 
НЕДРУГ: All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky. 
ФИБИ: They are. Why? 
НЕДРУГ: They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday. 
ФИБИ: Happy birthday! 
НЕДРУГ: Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice. 
ФИБИ: I know, it is. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Can I tell you a little secret? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: I want to keep one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies! 
ФИБИ: Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children! 
ФИБИ: Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane. 
ФИБИ: Oh, just ask him! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me?! 
ФИБИ: I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!! 
ФИБИ: You're right. 
ФИБИ: Tell him it's for you. 
МОНИКА: Feeling a little better sweetie? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up. 
МОНИКА: Me too. 
РОСС: Hey! I just heard. What's up? 
НЕДРУГ: Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? Are you crazy?! 
ФИБИ: So did you ask him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet. 
ФИБИ: Well, I'm kinda on a clock here. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh Fonzie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know who I always liked? Mork. 
ФИБИ: Undo it. Undo it. Undo it. 
НЕДРУГ: Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that's right. 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: How are you doing? 
ФИБИ: Okay, doctor says any minute now. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in? 
ФИБИ: Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you. 
МОНИКА: Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it? 
МОНИКА: Chandler! 
НЕДРУГ: Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. 
МОНИКА: So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift. 
МОНИКА: Oh, great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. Very good.

РОСС: Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.

РОСС: Argh! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Not to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, fair enough. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please. 
МОНИКА: Bye Dan! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, bye Monica. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye, momi-moo. 
НЕДРУГ: All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31. 
ФИБИ: What is that? 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing. 
НЕДРУГ: Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go! 
НЕДРУГ: I see the head. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, it has a head! 
НЕДРУГ: All right. Keep pushing! Come on! 
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. Here's your first baby. 
НЕДРУГ: YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! 
НЕДРУГ: Frank Jr. Jr.!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, how does he look? How does he look? 
НЕДРУГ: So gross! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. You ready to push again? 
ФИБИ: I already had a baby. Leave me alone. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? 
НЕДРУГ: Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on! 
НЕДРУГ: All right, he's coming. He's coming! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, where's his thing? 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler's a girl! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God, kindergarten flashback. 
НЕДРУГ: They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, keep saying it! 
НЕДРУГ: Am I too late?! 
НЕДРУГ: No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes. 
НЕДРУГ: We have our babies? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, we have our babies. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. 
РОСС: You did it, man. 
НЕДРУГ: Would you like to see them? 
ДЖОУИ: They're so small! 
НЕДРУГ: So, I'll call you tomorrow. 
МОНИКА: Great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? 
МОНИКА: Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary. Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this. 
МОНИКА: I think you're better than you think you are. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Okay, so... 
МОНИКА: Know when to stop. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right! 
МОНИКА: I think you're my favorite. 
ФИБИ: Which one do you have? 
МОНИКА: I don't care. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls. 
ФИБИ: But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, umm, no honey. 
ФИБИ: Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah. 
ФИБИ: So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing! 
ФИБИ: I know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So does it really hurt as bad as they say? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. You won't be able to take it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her? 
ФИБИ: They're gonna call her Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think? 
ФИБИ: Works on you.
