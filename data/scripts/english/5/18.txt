ДЖОУИ: Okay, pick a card.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: All right now, memorize it. You got it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes.
ДЖОУИ: Is that your card?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys!
РОСС: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi there!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
ФИБИ: What are you talking about?!
РОСС: Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute-y'know, which he is-so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
РОСС: I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings.
ДЖОУИ: I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
ДЖОУИ: Luck!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
МОНИКА: Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
НЕДРУГ: Good luck! Go get 'em!
ФИБИ: Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
ФИБИ: Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
МОНИКА: I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
ДЖОУИ: Ross! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!
РОСС: Okay!
ДЖОУИ: Done.
ФИБИ: Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
МОНИКА: I would love to do it together!
ДЖОУИ: They're gonna do it together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude! That's my girlfriend!
ДЖОУИ: What, so I gotta shut it down now?
РОСС: All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
МОНИКА: It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
РОСС: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
РОСС: Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
РОСС: You're not his godfather.
ДЖОУИ: What?! Are you kidding?!
РОСС: Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
ДЖОУИ: All right!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
РОСС: Really? That's great!
ДЖОУИ: I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, that kid looks familiar.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad!
РОСС: Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
ДЖОУИ: That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
РОСС: Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
ДЖОУИ: I look more like him than you do!
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
НЕДРУГ: So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them-I'm kidding.
НЕДРУГ: She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what a fun office.
НЕДРУГ: I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
НЕДРУГ: Rachel? Do you smoke?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories, about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
МОНИКА: That doesn't seem fair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it is the best.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
МОНИКА: Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I can do that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I would love to!
ФИБИ: Oh good!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
ФИБИ: Oh good.
ФИБИ: Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
МОНИКА: Yeah, me too!
ФИБИ: Oh, look at that.
МОНИКА: All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
ФИБИ: What happened to the intimate dinner party?
МОНИКА: Oh, we're not doing that. Okay.
ФИБИ: So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
МОНИКА: What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
ФИБИ: Like what?
МОНИКА: Cups.
ФИБИ: Cups? You're giving me cups?
МОНИКА: And ice!
ФИБИ: Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant.
ФИБИ: I got it! Mine!
РОСС: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hey! How'd the audition go?!
РОСС: Not so good.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?
РОСС: Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
МОНИКА: You got a callback too didn't you?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah I did!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
НЕДРУГ: Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh great!
НЕДРУГ: So anyway we really. Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh that's okay.
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
НЕДРУГ: So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
НЕДРУГ: Oh that's great! You are the best!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually. Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
НЕДРУГ: I thought you didn't smoke.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, Wow, those guys are crazy! But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
НЕДРУГ: We get high.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, me too.
НЕДРУГ: I'm kidding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, me too.
РОСС: Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
ДЖОУИ: Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so.
НЕДРУГ: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
ДЖОУИ: Who knows?
НЕДРУГ: Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
РОСС: Yes! I knew it! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
ДЖОУИ: Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
РОСС: Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
ДЖОУИ: Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
РОСС: Yeah, it is.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
РОСС: No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah sure. What's in 'em?
ФИБИ: Umm, cups.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
РОСС: Seriously that's a lot of cups.
ФИБИ: Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know I rued the day once didn't get a whole lot else done.
ФИБИ: Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs! Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
РОСС: What's up?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
РОСС: Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
ДЖОУИ: That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
РОСС: Well, you just.
ДЖОУИ: I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
РОСС: What?!
ДЖОУИ: What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
РОСС: Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
ДЖОУИ: At least I care about his feelings!
РОСС: What?!
ДЖОУИ: Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
РОСС: And why wouldn't he get it?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
РОСС: Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
ДЖОУИ: You just give him a spoon baby!
РОСС: Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
РОСС: You're kid's name is Raymond!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?! So's yours!
МОНИКА: How did work go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
МОНИКА: You stink!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks!
МОНИКА: No, I'mI'm serious!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, there's something different though-Oh my God! You smoked!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did not!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes you did! You look happy and sick you smoked!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wish I had smoked for my career.
МОНИКА: That's so gross!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
МОНИКА: Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think you smell great!
НЕДРУГ: So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so on board!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel didn't you just light that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
НЕДРУГ: I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
НЕДРУГ: Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like.
НЕДРУГ: Tell me about it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
НЕДРУГ: It does sound appealing.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I never could do it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get-what are those-those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
НЕДРУГ: Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
НЕДРУГ: My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay then!
ДЖОУИ: Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
НЕДРУГ: Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, no problem.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
ДЖОУИ: Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
РОСС: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Ross!
РОСС: Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
ДЖОУИ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
ДЖОУИ: Uh-oh.
НЕДРУГ: Is there a problem?
ДЖОУИ: Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, Hmm, soup.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, what did I say?
НЕДРУГ: Hmm, noodle soup.
ДЖОУИ: How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: All right, let's try one.
ДЖОУИ: Hmm, noodle soup.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Let's do it again.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
НЕДРУГ: COME ON!
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what? We need to move on.
ДЖОУИ: No! No! II can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey-hey-hey!
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh, busted!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. That didn't work out.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
НЕДРУГ: No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
НЕДРУГ: Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh man!
ФИБИ: Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
МОНИКА: Why don't you just go out with her!
ФИБИ: And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Awesome!
МОНИКА: Chandler! Everyone-no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
МОНИКА: Y'know go! Go! Right there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you! Thank you!
ФИБИ: Oh, look! Look! Look!
НЕДРУГ: Surprise!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
МОНИКА: That's the surprise!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
НЕДРУГ: Surprise!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
ФИБИ: I was in charge of cups.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay, not so weird.
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РОСС: Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah right!
РОСС: No really, II am! I feel bad!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, Hmm, noodle soup.
РОСС: Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
ДЖОУИ: What you do mean?
РОСС: I think, sub-consciously.
ДЖОУИ: Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
РОСС: I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
ДЖОУИ: Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor.
РОСС: No!
ДЖОУИ: No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
РОСС: There you go. Thank you!
ДЖОУИ: Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
РОСС: No.
ДЖОУИ: Eh, what are you gonna do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, great.
НЕДРУГ: So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, Yeah, absolutely!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll catch you guys later.
