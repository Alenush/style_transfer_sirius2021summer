ФИБИ: What am I sitting on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out. 
ФИБИ: Ew-eww!! Undies! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! Who's are they? Who's are they? 
РОСС: Well, they're not mine! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, they're mine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's! 
РОСС: Why are they here? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear. 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler? A word. 
ДЖОУИ: That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8? 
МОНИКА: Thank you Joey, thank you so much! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and 
МОНИКА: Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All this lying has been hard on us too. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, yeah actually. 
МОНИКА: We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships. 
МОНИКА: We are! Help us! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Help! 
ДЖОУИ: All right! But, you do it with me once. 
МОНИКА: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Didn't think so. 
МОНИКА: Hey, Phoebe! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, Pheebs! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Pheebs! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Pheebs! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you reading? 
ФИБИ: Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey that sounds like fun. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Okay...ooh, but are you going to have time to read it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I read that in high school. 
ФИБИ: This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish. 
РОСС: Hi. 
ДЖОУИ: What's wrong buddy? 
РОСС: Someone at work ate my sandwich! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what did the police say? 
РОСС: My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, it's just a sandwich! 
РОСС: Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life! 
МОНИКА: Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but 
РОСС: That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay? 
ДЖОУИ: I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch. 
ФИБИ: Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street. 
РОСС: Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?" 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie? 
ФИБИ: Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: Whoa! Ohh!! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you are a bad ass! 
ФИБИ: Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: Well, he stabbed me first!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry I'm late, but I left late. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Pheebs, what is the book about? 
ФИБИ: I thought you said you read it in high school. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway...umm, what is this book about? 
ФИБИ: Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy moors in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism. 
НЕДРУГ: How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the moors, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character. 
НЕДРУГ: Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here... 
ФИБИ: You completely stole my answer! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, honey that was pretty obvious. 
ФИБИ: Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it! 
НЕДРУГ: What do you think? You in the blue shirt. 
ФИБИ: I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. 
НЕДРУГ: Would ya care to venture one? 
ФИБИ: Would you care to venture one? 
НЕДРУГ: Are you just repeating what I'm saying? 
ФИБИ: Are you just repeating what I'm saying? 
НЕДРУГ: All right, let's move on. 
ФИБИ: Okay then. 
ФИБИ: Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you! 
РОСС: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
РОСС: Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller. 
РОСС: That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now! 
НЕДРУГ: God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out. 
ДЖОУИ: So you uh, still wondering? 
НЕДРУГ: No, we just went out. 
ДЖОУИ: You're smart. I like that. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!! 
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! 
ДЖОУИ: Hiya. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, is what she just said umm...Oh my God. You were actually gonna... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is going on here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick? 
ДЖОУИ: I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. 
ДЖОУИ: You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here! 
МОНИКА: We're so sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh...I don't know. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet! 
МОНИКА: Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!! 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you? 
РОСС: Yeah, of course, Donald. 
НЕДРУГ: We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part. 
РОСС: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: We want you to speak to a psychiatrist. 
РОСС: Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich. 
НЕДРУГ: A sandwich? 
РОСС: Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you know what? 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that. 
РОСС: You ate my sandwich? 
НЕДРУГ: It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. 
РОСС: Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with aMoist Maker? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РОСС: Do you perhaps remember seeing a note on top of it? 
НЕДРУГ: There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind. 
РОСС: That said it was my sandwich?! 
НЕДРУГ: Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. 
РОСС: You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! 
РОСС: MY SANDWICH?!!! 
РОСС: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So umm, what's this book about? 
ФИБИ: You didn't read this one either?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else. 
ФИБИ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman. 
ФИБИ: No! You should've read it yourself! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie! 
ФИБИ: Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre? 
ФИБИ: Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, go ahead Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time. 
НЕДРУГ: If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're naked in this picture! 
МОНИКА: I know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross? 
РОСС: Hey Chandler. Monica! 
МОНИКА: Ross, are you okay? 
РОСС: I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today. 
МОНИКА: Why?! 
РОСС: On account of my rage. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which I may say, right now, is out of control. 
РОСС: He gave me a pill for it. 
МОНИКА: A pill? 
РОСС: Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it. 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you're okay with that? 
РОСС: I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that! 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That was not funny! 
ФИБИ: Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun! 
ФИБИ: Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with? 
МОНИКА: I know! I know! I know! 
НЕДРУГ: Monica, you asked the question. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! That's Monica!! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!! 
РОСС: What's going on? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey has got a secret peephole! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no! No! No! No! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look! 
РОСС: Dude! That's my sister! 
МОНИКА: Give me that! 
ФИБИ: All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert! 
ДЖОУИ: No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this. 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey's a sex addict. 
ДЖОУИ: What?!! No I'm not!! 
МОНИКА: It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease! 
ДЖОУИ: No! No! I am not a sex addict! 
МОНИКА: Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff! 
ДЖОУИ: No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what is the truth? 
РОСС: Yeah, what's going on? 
ФИБИ: What's going on? 
ДЖОУИ: I slept with Monica. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well let's...let's see what everybody thinks of that? 
МОНИКА: Oh no! 
РОСС: You slept with my sister? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London. 
РОСС: This is not good for my rage. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, is this true? 
ДЖОУИ: Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? 
МОНИКА: Yes it's true. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? 
ДЖОУИ: Ahh...oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica? 
МОНИКА: I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir. 
РОСС: My God Monica!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict? 
ДЖОУИ: No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London! 
ФИБИ: So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. 
ДЖОУИ: That makes sense! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And the video camera? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, Monica? 
МОНИКА: I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: But sadly I could not be enticed. 
РОСС: Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?! 
МОНИКА: I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. 
ФИБИ: I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica? 
ФИБИ: I don't know! I didn't come with her! 
МОНИКА: All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week! 
НЕДРУГ: A test?!! 
МОНИКА: Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
