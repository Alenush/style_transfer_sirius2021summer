РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs? Could you get that? Please? 
ФИБИ: Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here. 
ФИБИ: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sucker! 
ФИБИ: Hello? Hey Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me? 
ФИБИ: Sure! Where is it? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner. 
ФИБИ: Ohh! So you're 5639?! 
ДЖОУИ: That's it! Thanks Pheebs! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him! 
ДЖОУИ: No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over! 
ФИБИ: Who was that? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person. 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Don't come out here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person! 
ДЖОУИ: I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here! 
НЕДРУГ: Would you mind doing a picture with us? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, what was that? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. 
ФИБИ: Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica? 
МОНИКА: Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long? 
ФИБИ: It's okay. What the hell took you so long? 
МОНИКА: Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard. 
ФИБИ: Which Richard? 
МОНИКА: The Richard. 
ФИБИ: Richard Simmons?! Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache? 
ФИБИ: Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it? 
МОНИКА: It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him. 
ФИБИ: That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ФИБИ: But again, Simmons. Go on. 
МОНИКА: The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all! 
ФИБИ: Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler? 
МОНИКА: Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year! 
МОНИКА: I know. 
ФИБИ: Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks! 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: On a totally different bet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: It's almost our anniversary! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler. 
ФИБИ: Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh. 
МОНИКА: I got you a present! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow! 
МОНИКА: I know, but you have to open it today! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! 
МОНИКА: For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do we have to? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there. 
МОНИКА: Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I think we should see other people. 
МОНИКА: But we can go, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a great idea. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I'm gonna go too! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary. 
ФИБИ: Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London. 
МОНИКА: Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets! 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, great story! I'm going! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work. 
ФИБИ: Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that. 
РОСС: Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Art lover! 
РОСС: What'd you say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I said art lover. 
РОСС: Is that supposed to be an insult? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, I'm very tired. 
РОСС: So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That sounds great. 
РОСС: Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night. 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time. 
ФИБИ: Naked alone time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door? 
ФИБИ: So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So it's pretty much the same Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: Okay, what about after I give you these candies? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now. 
ФИБИ: Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy plane-aversary. 
МОНИКА: Aww! I love you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I give you a present now? 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this! 
МОНИКА: I love the "I forgot the present" fake out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out? 
МОНИКА: Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever! 
ФИБИ: Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What-what Richard thing? 
ФИБИ: Oh no. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What Richard thing? 
ФИБИ: Simmons! Go with Simmons! 
МОНИКА: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not mad. 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. 
МОНИКА: Great! 
ФИБИ: Okay, London 1... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Look what happened! Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen... naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. 
РОСС: Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes... Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh. 
РОСС: Hey. 
РОСС: May I come in? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, yeah, if you want too. 
РОСС: Do you want me too? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure? 
РОСС: So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And um, what-what is that Ross? 
РОСС: The physical act of love. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Are you crazy? 
РОСС: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, you saw me?! Oh! 
РОСС: You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?! 
РОСС: No! No! No! No-no-no-no. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes! 
РОСС: Can we, can we just forget this ever happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry. 
РОСС: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
РОСС: All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?" 
ФИБИ: Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you don't eat animals. 
ФИБИ: For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God. 
ФИБИ: Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Love your condoms my man. 
ДЖОУИ: What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come. 
ФИБИ: Why are you dressed as a gladiator? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break. 
МОНИКА: Who are you talking too? 
ДЖОУИ: They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?! What happened?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does. 
МОНИКА: I'm so sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody. 
МОНИКА: I knew you were not okay with that. 
ФИБИ: So you're a gladiator! Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, what-what's going on? 
ФИБИ: Monica had lunch with Richard. 
ДЖОУИ: Dawson?! 
ФИБИ: Noo! But that would've been so cool! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Her boyfriend Richard! 
МОНИКА: It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it! 
МОНИКА: You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. 
ДЖОУИ: Aww, there we go. 
ФИБИ: I love Vegas! 
МОНИКА: I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Next time? 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, so close. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again! 
МОНИКА: I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's so funny, because I think I just did! 
МОНИКА: Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine with me! 
МОНИКА: Fine! Happy Anniversary! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding. 
МОНИКА: No it is not! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking... 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love. 
РОСС: Yep! That's hilarious! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. 
РОСС: Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. 
РОСС: Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. 
РОСС: What?! You totally get embarrassed! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. 
РОСС: Is that so? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary. 
ДЖОУИ: All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! 
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good luck! 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see. 
МОНИКА: Thank you. 
ФИБИ: Thanks. 
МОНИКА: I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever! 
ФИБИ: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry. 
МОНИКА: This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again. 
ФИБИ: So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! 
ФИБИ: Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one! 
МОНИКА: Anybody lose this? 
НЕДРУГ: Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! 
МОНИКА: Hmm. 
НЕДРУГ: So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you. 
РОСС: Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? 
РОСС: What the? What... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Miss? May I help you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident. 
ДЖОУИ: Can I change a hundred? 
НЕДРУГ: Changing one hundred! Good luck sir. 
ДЖОУИ: Let's ride. 
НЕДРУГ: 13. 
ДЖОУИ: Hit me! Ohh man! Wait! 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: My identical hand twin! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's an identical hand twin? 
ДЖОУИ: What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror? 
ДЖОУИ: Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How? 
ДЖОУИ: Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again I must go back to, how? 
ДЖОУИ: This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, are you unsupporting me again? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs!! 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: I found my identical hand twin! 
ФИБИ: Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
ФИБИ: But she just came up here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was Joey! 
ФИБИ: I wonder where she is. That is so weird. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard. 
ФИБИ: Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
ФИБИ: Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Good. I should really start wearing hats! 
НЕДРУГ: Welcome to Las Vegas. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you! Enjoy your flight? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. 
НЕДРУГ: Hope you had a nice flight. 
РОСС: Ohh, it was the best! 
РОСС: I think the check in is that way. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello! Ohh, kids love me. 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: You guys are here! Yay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pancho Vila? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?! 
РОСС: Hey, you wet my pants! 
ФИБИ: Whoa, what kind of party was this? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can...you have so crossed a line. 
РОСС: Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. 
ФИБИ: Ugh! 
РОСС: What? 
ФИБИ: That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing. 
РОСС: Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people. 
ФИБИ: M-M-Mole people? 
РОСС: What? No-no, a lurker. 
ФИБИ: Oh. What's a lurker? 
РОСС: Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then... 
ФИБИ: Kills you? 
РОСС: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot. 
ФИБИ: Ohhh! 
РОСС: Uh-hmm. 
ФИБИ: How do you know about this? 
РОСС: My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance...karate lessons. 
ФИБИ: Dance karate? 
РОСС: Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, it won't come off! 
РОСС: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It won't come off! 
РОСС: Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey you made it! 
РОСС: Joey!! 
ДЖОУИ: All right! Hey-hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!! 
ДЖОУИ: Who's your friend? He's hot! 
РОСС: Thanks man. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
РОСС: Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie. 
ДЖОУИ: No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin! 
РОСС: Your what? 
ДЖОУИ: My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine! 
РОСС: What?! That's not gonna make you any money! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb. 
МОНИКА: All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See you later Mon. 
МОНИКА: Wait Chandler, what are you doing?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does it look like? I'm going home. 
МОНИКА: What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life. 
МОНИКА: Not any more. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! 
МОНИКА: Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing. 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy? 
НЕДРУГ: Which guy? 
ДЖОУИ: He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! How you doin'? 
НЕДРУГ: Very busy. 
ДЖОУИ: Right! Okay. 
РОСС: Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What else did he say? 
РОСС: Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this! 
РОСС: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I am a human doodle!! 
РОСС: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear! 
РОСС: Okay, there was some staring and pointing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I need a, I need a drink! 
РОСС: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Macadamia nut? 
РОСС: Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hm-mmm! 
РОСС: Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nope! 
ФИБИ: Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Ohh! You made up! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, get a room. 
МОНИКА: We have one. 
ФИБИ: I know. Use it. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies! 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me? 
ДЖОУИ: It's me, Joey! 
НЕДРУГ: Do I know you? 
ДЖОУИ: Joey! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?! 
НЕДРУГ: Nothing? 
ДЖОУИ: Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us! 
НЕДРУГ: I have to get back to... 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand! 
НЕДРУГ: That's okay. 
ДЖОУИ: But you haven't even heard the chorus! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel. 
РОСС: All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hit me! 
РОСС: Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!
