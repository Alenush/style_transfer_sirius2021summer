МОНИКА: Come in. I've been waiting for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy! 
МОНИКА: Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta? 
МОНИКА: Uh-huh, that one! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him. 
МОНИКА: Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why aren't you guys at the movie? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out! 
РОСС: I had to talk loud because the movie was loud! 
ДЖОУИ: He's talking to London! 
МОНИКА: But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily? 
ДЖОУИ: Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. 
РОСС: I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit! 
ДЖОУИ: Ross! Way to suck up to the family. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ha-ha-ha- -enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux! 
ДЖОУИ: Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned. 
МОНИКА: Vomit tux? Who vomited on, y'know what, what you up to Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host! 
МОНИКА: Oh that's great! 
ДЖОУИ: A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do! 
ФИБИ: Ugh, PBS! 
МОНИКА: What's wrong with PBS? 
ФИБИ: Ugh, what's right with them? 
ДЖОУИ: Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs. 
ФИБИ: All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys! 
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies. 
ФИБИ: This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish! 
ФИБИ: What-what are you talking about?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. So? 
ДЖОУИ: It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry. 
ФИБИ: Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, may I ask for one example? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, it's... Y'know there's...no you may not! 
ДЖОУИ: That's because all people are selfish. 
ФИБИ: Are you calling me selfish?! 
ДЖОУИ: Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right? 
ФИБИ: I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. 
РОСС: Hello. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello, Ross? 
РОСС: Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye! 
РОСС: No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me! 
НЕДРУГ: Really? About what? 
РОСС: Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you. 
НЕДРУГ: I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do. 
РОСС: She's talking. 
НЕДРУГ: Yay! 
ФИБИ: Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant? 
ДЖОУИ: That he doesn't exist. 
ФИБИ: Right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man? 
МОНИКА: Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! That's what you heard? You said that? 
МОНИКА: I might've said that. Why is that funny? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog! 
РОСС: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РОСС: Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! 
МОНИКА: That's great! 
РОСС: In London! 
МОНИКА: What?! 
РОСС: She wants me to move to London. 
МОНИКА: But you live here! You know that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what-what are you gonna do? 
РОСС: I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife. 
РОСС: It could happen. 
ДЖОУИ: How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya! 
НЕДРУГ: This will be your phone. 
ДЖОУИ: That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. 
НЕДРУГ: No you answer it and take pledges. 
ДЖОУИ: But I'm the host! 
НЕДРУГ: No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones. 
ДЖОУИ: You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, here's your phone doctor. 
ФИБИ: I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish. 
ФИБИ: I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question? 
МОНИКА: Sure! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler! Is he? 
МОНИКА: Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. 
РОСС: All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben. 
НЕДРУГ: I understand that would be difficult. 
РОСС: Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know, it's just... 
РОСС: Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. 
РОСС: All right, did you just say all right? 
НЕДРУГ: I did. Now I'm the idiot. 
РОСС: Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still. 
РОСС: Yes, tell me. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends. 
РОСС: I know. I am, I am so sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her. 
РОСС: Again, very sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her! 
РОСС: Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you. 
НЕДРУГ: All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work. 
РОСС: Oh that is so great! That's.... 
НЕДРУГ: As long as you don't see Rachel anymore. 
РОСС: So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! 
ФИБИ: Ooh-ohh! 
МОНИКА: Great! 
РОСС: No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again. 
ФИБИ: Why? 
МОНИКА: What?! You can't, what did you tell her? 
РОСС: I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends. 
МОНИКА: Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's true! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's true! 
МОНИКА: No, you cannot. 
РОСС: Thanks for the help, problem solved. 
МОНИКА: Hello. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Mon! 
МОНИКА: Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV? 
ДЖОУИ: See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure. 
МОНИКА: You're not on TV. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, there he is! There he is! 
ДЖОУИ: Hello New York! 
НЕДРУГ: Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel! 
МОНИКА: Hi Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars. 
МОНИКА: William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, so? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had. 
МОНИКА: Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? 
МОНИКА: Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's your point? 
ДЖОУИ: PBS telethon. 
ФИБИ: Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! What good is that gonna do anybody? 
ФИБИ: Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not. 
ДЖОУИ: Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya. 
ФИБИ: Aw, dammit! 
НЕДРУГ: Back on in 30 seconds people! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on man! You've been here all day! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh? 
НЕДРУГ: We're on in 3, 2, 
НЕДРУГ: Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Circ 'du Sole, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to... 
РОСС: Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. 
МОНИКА: A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, it's not a toy. 
РОСС: Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken! 
МОНИКА: All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me. 
ДЖОУИ: PBS Telethon. 
ФИБИ: Hi Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200. 
ДЖОУИ: $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed. 
ДЖОУИ: And you don't a little good about donating the money? 
ФИБИ: No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster. 
ДЖОУИ: A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, not the one I had my eye on. 
НЕДРУГ: It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers. Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani! 
ФИБИ: Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel, Oh no! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best. 
МОНИКА: Keep talking. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH-MY-GOD. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex! 
МОНИКА: Well, if we owe it? Oh my, When is Joey gonna be home? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on. 
МОНИКА: But, I just cleaned the bathroom. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, let's show them how it's done. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Ow! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know that wasn't part of it? 
МОНИКА: I know! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late! 
РОСС: For what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes. 
РОСС: Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay! 
РОСС: It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Like what? 
РОСС: Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help. 
РОСС: No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to. Hi! 
РОСС: Thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy! 
РОСС: Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York? 
МОНИКА: Never done that before. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope.
