МОНИКА: Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, good idea. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey man, what's up? 
РОСС: Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, Ross, look! Look! 
РОСС: What? Where? 
ДЖОУИ: Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look! 
РОСС: What am I looking at? 
ДЖОУИ: Somebody help me out here! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: How are you? 
ФИБИ: Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes. 
ДЖОУИ: You got to go on a ride along?! 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh! 
ДЖОУИ: I want to go on a ride along! 
РОСС: Me too! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah! Me too! 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! You? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it's kinda dangerous. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I like danger. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you guys free tonight? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at night time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, thank God! Finally! 
МОНИКА: Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know....And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog. 
МОНИКА: You can also find him under umm, dog and dead. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great! Thanks! 
МОНИКА: All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh? 
МОНИКА: I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita? 
РОСС: Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready. 
МОНИКА: All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM? 
МОНИКА: Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
МОНИКА: What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! 
РОСС: That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is starting to get dark out there. 
РОСС: He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. But it is officially nighttime. 
РОСС: Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya? 
НЕДРУГ: It's called the cherry. 
РОСС: It's the...Chandler!! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho, yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce? 
ДЖОУИ: Yep! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you can't eat that in my car. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your tax dollars? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! That sandwich really does smell good. 
ДЖОУИ: Did I say you could smell it?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't smell your sandwich? 
ДЖОУИ: Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Are you thinking about Monica? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, what's that like? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! 
МОНИКА: Rach! It's me! Pick up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! What's up?! 
МОНИКА: I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So all we have is ice? 
МОНИКА: See if he has ice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh! 
РОСС: So where are we going next? 
НЕДРУГ: This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we? 
ДЖОУИ: Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up? 
НЕДРУГ: It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that! 
РОСС: Yeah, no one talks like that! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop! 
РОСС: Hey, I'm more cop than you two! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you figure that? 
РОСС: Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay. 
РОСС: Umm, jealous! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here. 
РОСС: Yeah, no problem. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross! 
РОСС: Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, what's up with that Serpico? 
НЕДРУГ: Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye. 
МОНИКА: Nooo! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! 
МОНИКА: Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! We can't do that! 
МОНИКА: We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message! 
МОНИКА: I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him...help him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't think he's the one who needs help. 
МОНИКА: No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! 
МОНИКА: Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! 
НЕДРУГ: You're messages have been erased. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noooooooo! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down! 
НЕДРУГ: No. But that reminds me, sign this. 
РОСС: What is it? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?! 
РОСС: What? What? What? What is it? 
ДЖОУИ: Is everything okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's going on? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did? 
ДЖОУИ: You okay man? 
РОСС: Uh-huh. Thank Joey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, HELLO!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi. 
МОНИКА: All right, I guess we should go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, wait. Wait. 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah right! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this! 
МОНИКА: There's nothing we can do. You erased the message! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah well unless we tell him. 
МОНИКА: Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message. 
РОСС: Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! 
МОНИКА: Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, anybody want to meet a hero? 
ФИБИ: John Glenn is here?! 
НЕДРУГ: No, Joey! 
РОСС: Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car... 
НЕДРУГ: Wait! Hold on! Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, go ahead. 
РОСС: Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me! 
ФИБИ: My God, Joey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was a car backfire! 
РОСС: Yeah, but-but he didn't know that! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I didn't know that. 
РОСС: And it could've just as easily have been a bullet. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who jumps at loud noises! 
РОСС: Wow! I could've died tonight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. 
РОСС: I do have a newfound respect for life. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: So you wanna get some dinner? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood. 
ФИБИ: Okay! 
НЕДРУГ: All right. 
ФИБИ: Bye! 
НЕДРУГ: Bye! 
ДЖОУИ: Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! 
ДЖОУИ: Dude! How come you took off? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever... 
ДЖОУИ: Is something wrong? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dove in front of Ross! Ross! 
ДЖОУИ: That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do not hate Ross! 
ДЖОУИ: Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What picture? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me! 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew... you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: From a bullet! 
ДЖОУИ: I know it doesn't make much sense... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Much sense?! 
ДЖОУИ: Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you risked your life, for a sandwich! 
ДЖОУИ: I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me. 
ДЖОУИ: No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. 
ДЖОУИ: No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog! 
ДЖОУИ: How good is that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oi-ho, yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: See? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hm-hmm. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hi! 
РОСС: Rach, what uh, what are you doing here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! 
РОСС: Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross? 
РОСС: The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What? What happened?! 
РОСС: Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
РОСС: And somebody took a shot at me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! 
РОСС: No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because a car backfired? 
РОСС: Okay, why are you here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today. 
РОСС: You talked to her? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine. 
РОСС: Well, okay, what-what did she say? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. 
РОСС: Wow! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right? 
РОСС: Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because...I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me...not important. The point is, I was right. You're decision. Okay? I was right. You're decision. 
РОСС: Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that? 
РОСС: Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience! 
РОСС: You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff. 
РОСС: Huh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily? 
РОСС: That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there you go! 
РОСС: Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Close call day. 
РОСС: Hey, thanks Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. 
РОСС: Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh? 
РОСС: "Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
РОСС: Hey umm, was-was Monica here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Yeah, I want my money back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right? 
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real? 
ФИБИ: Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story. 
РОСС: I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something. 
МОНИКА: Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Before or after you were shot by your own troops? 
РОСС: I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, hero sandwiches. 
ФИБИ: Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
