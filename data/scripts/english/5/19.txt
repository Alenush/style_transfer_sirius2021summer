РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
РОСС: Wow! How'd you get in there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
НЕДРУГ: Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
НЕДРУГ: It's uh, 27 dollars even.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay. Here you go.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, where's the chicken?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
НЕДРУГ: Great. I'll see you later!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, bye!
РОСС: What the hell was that?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РОСС: The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was not flirting.
РОСС: It was totally flirting. Somebody got a haircut.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
РОСС: Yeah, right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
РОСС: I'm good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law amp Order!
ФИБИ: I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
ФИБИ: Don't get me started on that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was not flirting.
РОСС: And on your anniversary, for shame!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's going on?
РОСС: Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was not and oh God, shh!
РОСС: Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
ФИБИ: Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
РОСС: Well.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! We broke up two years ago you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
РОСС: Well, II was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hm-mmm.
РОСС: And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
ФИБИ: Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
РОСС: This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the CharmORoss. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
ФИБИ: See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
ДЖОУИ: Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Big night!
ФИБИ: This is so cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, Joey on Law amp Order, you must be very proud!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
ДЖОУИ: She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I uh weighed like 27 pounds when I was born so.
МОНИКА: Hey! Happy Anniversary!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
МОНИКА: So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
МОНИКА: Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The one that doesn't.
МОНИКА: That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
МОНИКА: That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: You have got to go home!
ФИБИ: But I like it here!
МОНИКА: You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
ФИБИ: Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
МОНИКА: Great!
ФИБИ: Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
ДЖОУИ: Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
ФИБИ: I guess so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here you go. Thank you!
ФИБИ: Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh what, you-you want both of them?
ФИБИ: Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
ФИБИ: Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tell her to wear her own earrings.
ФИБИ: These are her earrings.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
ФИБИ: Why not?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because I lose her stuff!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
ДЖОУИ: Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you said, Big lima bean, bubbling up. Would she understand the difference?
МОНИКА: Rach? What are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
МОНИКА: It's a diaper commercial.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!

РОСС: I'll get it! I will get that!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's 12.15.
РОСС: Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Thanks.
РОСС: You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna try.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're welcome.
РОСС: You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РОСС: This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
МОНИКА: What's goin' on?
РОСС: Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
МОНИКА: It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
РОСС: Really?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?!
МОНИКА: It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
МОНИКА: Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
ДЖОУИ: True story!
МОНИКА: Chandler, this actually bothers you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
РОСС: And thank you, for that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
РОСС: What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
РОСС: All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you-I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
ФИБИ: I found it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
ФИБИ: On your dresser.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay that is the one we already have!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
МОНИКА: What?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what is it?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, they cut me out of the show.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: Are you sure?
ФИБИ: Maybe your scene's coming up?
ДЖОУИ: Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: I'm in it.
ФИБИ: This is terrible, what are you going to do?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
ФИБИ: That's not good.
ДЖОУИ: No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
ДЖОУИ: Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
НЕДРУГ: No! Sam Waterston!
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
НЕДРУГ: No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Doesn't know, Hello. But she knows Capricorn One.
МОНИКА: Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
ФИБИ: But I already gave them back to you!
МОНИКА: No you didn't.
ФИБИ: All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
ФИБИ: Make sure you check Chandler's jewelery box.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelery box?
ФИБИ: Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
РОСС: Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
ФИБИ: Why are you being weird?
РОСС: Do you like it?
ФИБИ: No, that would be, Why are you being cute?
РОСС: Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
ФИБИ: Ohh! I did not get that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law amp Order?
МОНИКА: Yeah, it's good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law amp Order and that you flirted with every guy in the TriState area!
МОНИКА: Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
МОНИКА: Go on, teach me something about men and women.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, I'm just flirting, no big deal. But the guy is thinking, Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!
МОНИКА: No way!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's true.
МОНИКА: Well that's pathetic!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again true.
МОНИКА: And this goes for all guys?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
ДЖОУИ: All right, it's another commercial I still haven't told her!
РОСС: Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
ДЖОУИ: I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
МОНИКА: No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, all right. Ooh!
НЕДРУГ: Joey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Did you find it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
ФИБИ: Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, calm down, here they are.
МОНИКА: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: What are we going to do?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I don't know.
ФИБИ: All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
ФИБИ: I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh that'd be great!
ФИБИ: Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
МОНИКА: Yeah, what is it?
ФИБИ: Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
МОНИКА: Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
ФИБИ: I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
МОНИКА: All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
ФИБИ: No.
МОНИКА: Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
ФИБИ: Yeah! You're the best!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, III, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
МОНИКА: That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Your sunglasses?!
МОНИКА: Yes!
ФИБИ: Oh, right!
НЕДРУГ: Pizza!
РОСС: Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, hold on. Okay.

РОСС: Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
НЕДРУГ: It's uh, 12.50.
РОСС: Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
НЕДРУГ: No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
РОСС: Gas? Wow! Intense.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
РОСС: Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: They put that in.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
НЕДРУГ: Well okay!
РОСС: A lot of other gas smells.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh the humanity.
РОСС: Meth-methane smells.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
РОСС: Oh but III haven't paid you yet!
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
РОСС: Was I talking to her about gas?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: More so than anything else.
ФИБИ: III found it interesting.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry.
РОСС: Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
ФИБИ: Ross?
РОСС: Yeah?
ФИБИ: What else do they add smell too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, is there a problem?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No. Every thing's-they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! That was flirting?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Wow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
НЕДРУГ: The guy with the gas?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. I'mI'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
НЕДРУГ: I just, I thought Joey was there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
РОСС: What do you mean?

РОСС: And she just gave you this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
РОСС: Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
