НЕДРУГ: Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll? 
ФИБИ: I'm fine, thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I? 
МОНИКА: No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hiya doin' pumpkin? 
ФИБИ: Nope. 
МОНИКА: So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh? 
НЕДРУГ: I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: What do you, what do you think? 
МОНИКА: I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her? 
НЕДРУГ: Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay? 
МОНИКА: I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral... 
НЕДРУГ: I'll see you after work sweetie. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Bye! 
ФИБИ: So, what movie should we see? 
МОНИКА: Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!! 
ФИБИ: What?! Really?! 
МОНИКА: He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer! 
ФИБИ: I can't believe this! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast! 
МОНИКА: Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! 
ФИБИ: No, but it is fast. Isn't it? 
МОНИКА: Ohhhh! 
ФИБИ: No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what are you gonna do? 
ФИБИ: I don't know. I'll just handle it. I'll ask you to talk to him! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me?! Why me? 
ФИБИ: Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be. 
МОНИКА: That is so sweet! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? 
РОСС: Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. 
РОСС: Also an island. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what time is it? 
РОСС: 2:17. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? 
РОСС: Are you serious?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. 
РОСС: Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, you guys... 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is Monica here? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl. 
РОСС: You bought Shawn Cassidy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Check it out! 
РОСС: What-what is it?! 
ДЖОУИ: What the hell is that?!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's a, it's a cat! 
ДЖОУИ: That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.} 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes it is! 
РОСС: Why is it inside out?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat! 
РОСС: How much did you pay for that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal. 
РОСС: Yeah? How much? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A thousand bucks. 
РОСС: ON A CAT??!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: It's not a cat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it! 
РОСС: Free cats do that too, y'know. 
ДЖОУИ: It's not a cat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?! 
РОСС: Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, the ball thing. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! 
РОСС: Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-oh. 
РОСС: What? 
ДЖОУИ: I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom! 
ДЖОУИ: Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it! 
РОСС: I know! Don't switch hands, okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey ladies! What are you in here for? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler, what are you doing here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gary, I'm here to report a crime. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. 
НЕДРУГ: What's up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean scared. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I mean happy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Scared? Happy? 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, what-what are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there! 
НЕДРУГ: I know! I can't wait! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were you're parents happy, or something? 
НЕДРУГ: Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just...I wanna be around her as much as I can. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary. 
НЕДРУГ: So you know what I'm talking about, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica! 
НЕДРУГ: No, it's too soon for you guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you're right about that. 
РОСС: ...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?! 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe this should be more of a quiet game. 
МОНИКА: Hey guys! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. 
МОНИКА: All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work! 
РОСС: How do you know? You don't have a watch. 
МОНИКА: Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
РОСС: Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we haven't dropped it in... 
РОСС: 2 hours, 27 minutes. 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
МОНИКА: I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. 
РОСС: Hey Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
РОСС: Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time. 
МОНИКА: Rach? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: You have scratches all over you, what happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it's my cat. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, I got a cat. 
МОНИКА: I don't want a cat! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!" 
РОСС: Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat. 
МОНИКА: What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I was gonna let you play with it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes I did, and I think you should do it. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady. 
ФИБИ: You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him. 
ФИБИ: Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Gar! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: You look very pretty today. 
ФИБИ: Thanks! Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Here's the thing. 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward. 
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. 
НЕДРУГ: Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards. 
ФИБИ: No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: I want you to move in with me. 
ФИБИ: That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it. 
ФИБИ: I just...I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. 
ФИБИ: I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just... I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Which is why my answer is yes! 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh! I'm so...happy. 
РОСС: Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours? 
ДЖОУИ: That's right baby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, let me in. 
МОНИКА: No-no! Don't do it! Don't! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: He's a dropper! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, that's right! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not a dropper! 
РОСС: It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's throwing and catching! 
РОСС: All right. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Oh! That's so hard. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat! 
МОНИКА: Oh my...Oh good God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! 
РОСС: Baking it didn't help, huh? 
МОНИКА: So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I tried! They won't take her back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ. 
МОНИКА: Rach, why won't they take it back? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats? 
МОНИКА: Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you almost overreacted to something. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: We have great news! 
ФИБИ: We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay! 
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations! Congrats! 
ФИБИ: I know, I'm so excited! 
НЕДРУГ: So am I! 
ФИБИ: Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'll see you at the station later. 
ФИБИ: Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in! 
НЕДРУГ: All right. 
МОНИКА: So you're moving in with him. What happened? 
ФИБИ: I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps. 
МОНИКА: Why, do you write him a lot? 
ФИБИ: No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights? 
ФИБИ: No, nothing. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh really? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Nothing at all? 
ФИБИ: No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh! 
НЕДРУГ: Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together. 
НЕДРУГ: So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water? 
НЕДРУГ: In a minute. You-you checked today's Post? 
ФИБИ: Umm, yeah! Today's. 
НЕДРУГ: 'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights! 
ФИБИ: Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging! 
НЕДРУГ: Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you? 
ФИБИ: Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry! 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe... 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox. 
ФИБИ: That's so sweet. 
НЕДРУГ: Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just...I want you to be happy 
ФИБИ: Living with you would make me happy. 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, you don't have to say that. 
ФИБИ: No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you! 
НЕДРУГ: Are you sure? 
ФИБИ: Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh that's great! 
ФИБИ: Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not a baby! It's a cat! 
НЕДРУГ: Eew! It's creepy looking! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! No! It's actually...it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it? 
НЕДРУГ: No, I hate cats. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! What an unusual cat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it? 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, a thousand. 
НЕДРУГ: I thought you wanted to adopt your cat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody? 
РОСС: I'm starving! 
МОНИКА: Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time! 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game! 
МОНИКА: Please! I made this game what it is. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not fun anymore? 
РОСС: I'm still hungry! 
МОНИКА: All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me? 
РОСС: I am! 
МОНИКА: All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later. 
МОНИКА: Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson. 
РОСС: Oh, thank God! 
ДЖОУИ: Did you get your money back? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, 15 hundred dollars. 
МОНИКА: Wow! You made a profit! 
НЕДРУГ: I just came for the red-velvet pillow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, there you go. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something? 
НЕДРУГ: I really like waking up with you. 
ФИБИ: I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day. 
НЕДРУГ: That would be great! 
ФИБИ: We could have breakfast in bed... 
НЕДРУГ: Wait, just a second. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Oh! Oh no. 
МОНИКА: All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive! 
ФИБИ: Oh good, you're all up. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, that's over. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out! 
ФИБИ: He shot a bird! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that is over! 
НЕДРУГ: That's terrible! I'm sorry! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, are you okay? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey, here Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: Nah, I don't feel like playing. 
МОНИКА: It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball! 
НЕДРУГ: All right. Okay. I'm starving! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You guys wanna eat here? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! As long as we're here! 
ДЖОУИ: Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long. 
РОСС: I know. My arm is killing me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I meant with the dropper over here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
