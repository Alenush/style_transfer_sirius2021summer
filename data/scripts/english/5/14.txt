ФИБИ: Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'd say from the looks of it our naked buddy is moving.
РОСС: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
РОСС: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
НЕДРУГ: Good idea! Yes!
РОСС: It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
РОСС: Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
ФИБИ: It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
РОСС: Ohh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
ФИБИ: Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ФИБИ: Ahhh! Chandler and Monica! Chandler and Monica!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: CHANDLER AND MONICA!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH MY GOD!
ФИБИ: OH! MY EYES! MY EYES!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! Phoebe! It's okay! It's okay!
ФИБИ: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW!
ФИБИ: YOU KNOW?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!
РОСС: What's going on?
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: HI! Hi!
РОСС: What?! What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
РОСС: Actually, it looks really good.
ФИБИ: Get in here!
ФИБИ: You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or. Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
ФИБИ: Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Come here! Come here!
ДЖОУИ: What? What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
ФИБИ: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
ФИБИ: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh-what do you mean?
ФИБИ: Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh, II would enjoy that!
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
ДЖОУИ: I can't take any.
ФИБИ: No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
ДЖОУИ: Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don't have any secrets!
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
ДЖОУИ: Ugh.
ФИБИ: Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ФИБИ: And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello children!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah the material feels so soft hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
ФИБИ: Well, if you really wanna know, I'm. Oh! I can't tell you this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
ФИБИ: Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's going on?
ФИБИ: I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee. Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
МОНИКА: You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
МОНИКА: Okay, now you're even cuter!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
МОНИКА: What are you talking about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
МОНИКА: That's not possible!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ow!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y'know II can't hear that enough.
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
МОНИКА: This bicep?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it's not flexed right now!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
МОНИКА: Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, I'll do it with ya.
МОНИКА: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
МОНИКА: I mean II don't I think I have enough quarters.
ФИБИ: I have quarters!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
РОСС: Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to tip the scales in my direction. Check it out, you can probably see it from the window.
МОНИКА: Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
РОСС: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That new mountain bike?
РОСС: No.
МОНИКА: Well what did you send?
РОСС: A basket of mini-muffins.
ФИБИ: But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
РОСС: The small one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
РОСС: Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your work makes me sad.
РОСС: Oh man! I want that place so much! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
МОНИКА: Bye!
НЕДРУГ: Bye!
ФИБИ: Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!
МОНИКА: Actually, I did!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
МОНИКА: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious?
МОНИКА: Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps. She knows!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe knows about us!
ДЖОУИ: Well I didn't tell them!
МОНИКА: Them?! Who's them?
ДЖОУИ: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
МОНИКА: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh man!
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
МОНИКА: Unless.
ДЖОУИ: No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
МОНИКА: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
РОСС: Noooo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
ФИБИ: Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
РОСС: Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what you should do?
РОСС: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
ДЖОУИ: I'm listening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See?
РОСС: That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
ФИБИ: He broke that.
РОСС: Well, he had gravity boots.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, he broke those too.
ДЖОУИ: So he likes to break stuff.
РОСС: Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but II will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
ФИБИ: I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
РОСС: Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
ФИБИ: Oh? Hello you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
ФИБИ: Eh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
ФИБИ: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
ФИБИ: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you kidding?!
ФИБИ: No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can not believe he would do that to Mon. Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
ДЖОУИ: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: They know you know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
ФИБИ: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
ДЖОУИ: I couldn't even if I wanted too.
РОСС: Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And II realize that the competition is fierce but. I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica and Rachel and Phoebe are planning their respective strategies to break the other pairing. Joey is not amused.
МОНИКА: Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
МОНИКА: Oh yeah!
ФИБИ: All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Be sexy.
ФИБИ: Please.
ФИБИ: So Chandler, II'd love to come by tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
ФИБИ: Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes.
ФИБИ: Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Show time!
ФИБИ: Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay!
ФИБИ: And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
МОНИКА: All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
МОНИКА: Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you know?!
МОНИКА: Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: At this?!
МОНИКА: Just go get some! Go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
ФИБИ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay? Whoa, wait!
ФИБИ: Good idea!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, oh wait!
ФИБИ: Oh now, don't give away the farm!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on in.
ФИБИ: I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure.
ФИБИ: So, here we are. Nervous?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me? No. You?
ФИБИ: No, I want this to happen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So do I.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm gonna put on some music.
ФИБИ: Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look good.
ФИБИ: Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
ФИБИ: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, do you not want to?
ФИБИ: No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
МОНИКА: She's bluffing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
ФИБИ: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay!
ДЖОУИ: I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
ФИБИ: Joey! Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.
ДЖОУИ: It's not my first time.
МОНИКА: You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
МОНИКА: Of course.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you're-you're going?
ФИБИ: Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not if I kiss you first.
ФИБИ: Ooh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
ФИБИ: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win! I can't have sex with ya!
ФИБИ: And why not?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I'm in love with Monica!
ФИБИ: You're-you're what?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Love her! That's right, I LOVE HER! I love her! I love you, Monica.
МОНИКА: I love you too Chandler.
ФИБИ: I just. I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
ДЖОУИ: Dude!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
ФИБИ: God!
ДЖОУИ: All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
МОНИКА: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
РОСС: A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
НЕДРУГ: I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
РОСС: Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
НЕДРУГ: I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
РОСС: Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I. What? No! Wh. What are you doing?! GET OFF MY SISTER!
