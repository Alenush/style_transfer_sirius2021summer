НЕДРУГ: Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife. 
РОСС: Yay! 
НЕДРУГ: You may kiss the bride. 
НЕДРУГ: This is worse than when he married the lesbian. 
НЕДРУГ: Just keep smiling. 
РОСС: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, that went well. Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It could've been worse, he could've shot her. 
РОСС: That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it? 
НЕДРУГ: You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right? 
РОСС: That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup. 
НЕДРУГ: I hate you!! 
РОСС: And, I love you!! 
НЕДРУГ: Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross? 
РОСС: That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, Waltham interiors. 
ФИБИ: Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange. 
НЕДРУГ: Who? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too! 
ФИБИ: Hello? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship. 
МОНИКА: I know. How could we have let this happen? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seven times! 
МОНИКА: Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In a foreign, romantic country. 
МОНИКА: I blame London. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bad London! 
МОНИКА: So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it. 
МОНИКА: Only here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs. 
МОНИКА: I'll meet you there in two minutes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something. 
МОНИКА: Now? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I? 
МОНИКА: Oh, I-I don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what should I do? 
МОНИКА: Just uh, do the right thing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant. 
МОНИКА: Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me. 
НЕДРУГ: Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what's up? 
МОНИКА: Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forget it, that's off. 
МОНИКА: Why?! 
НЕДРУГ: The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes. 
МОНИКА: Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count. 
МОНИКА: That's true. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The man's got a point. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi! 
РОСС: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well. 
РОСС: Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right? 
РОСС: No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right! 
РОСС: But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!! 
ДЖОУИ: Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so... 
РОСС: Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!! 
ДЖОУИ: You spit on me man! 
РОСС: Look, I'm sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame. 
РОСС: Oh, right! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Get the hell out of there, y'know? 
РОСС: Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, look at that, same thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, Rachel! Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hello Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, we do. But, we have to change first. 
МОНИКА: Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes. 
МОНИКА: Fifteen minutes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yay! 
МОНИКА: Great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hi, so what happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Ross said my name. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room? 
МОНИКА: But my clothes are-ohh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, you look... 
МОНИКА: No time for that! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I've got a girl in here. 
ДЖОУИ: No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we're-we're hanging out in here! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here? 
МОНИКА: Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant! 
ДЖОУИ: My Giant? I love that movie! 
МОНИКА: You really think this is okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it. 
МОНИКА: Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser. 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
РОСС: Emily?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope, not under here! 
МОНИКА: You didn't find her? 
РОСС: No, I've looked everywhere! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I think you should keep looking! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, for about 30 minutes. 
МОНИКА: Or 45. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 
РОСС: No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here. 
МОНИКА: Well, it's getting late. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we're gonna go. 
РОСС: Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while? 
МОНИКА: Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it's a very large plane. 
РОСС: That's cool. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But, we'll stay here with you. 
РОСС: Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have to leave for New York in an hour. 
МОНИКА: I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it. 
РОСС: Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily! 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: You can forget about Emily, she's not with us. 
НЕДРУГ: We've come for her things. 
РОСС: Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she? 
НЕДРУГ: She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again. 
НЕДРУГ: We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, I'm standing right here! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes, there you are. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside. 
НЕДРУГ: Goodbye Geller. 
РОСС: Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that. 
НЕДРУГ: All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face! 
НЕДРУГ: Call me. 
НЕДРУГ: You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window! 
МОНИКА: Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters. 
МОНИКА: I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 'Kay! 
ДЖОУИ: Can I ask you something? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, no. 
ДЖОУИ: Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. 
ДЖОУИ: I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks man. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay man. 
ДЖОУИ: But what about how much taller he is than me? 
ДЖОУИ: I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour. 
МОНИКА: I know! 
ДЖОУИ: Had the beef-tips, huh? 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: You ate meat! You had sex! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No we didn't! 
ФИБИ: I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, I did not have sex. 
ФИБИ: This pregnancy is throwing me all off. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck. 
ФИБИ: Oh, me too! 
ДЖОУИ: Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days? 
ФИБИ: Oh right, maybe I'll just go home. 
МОНИКА: Well, we certainly are alone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule. 
МОНИКА: Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. 
МОНИКА: Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay? 
МОНИКА: That's okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I'm cute too. 
МОНИКА: And you're cute too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm still on London time, does that count? 
МОНИКА: That counts! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, good! 
РОСС: Rach! Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
РОСС: Hi! What are you, what are you doing here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours. 
РОСС: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh? 
РОСС: Not yet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So umm, what time are you supposed to leave? 
НЕДРУГ: This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call. 
РОСС: Pretty soon I guess. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. I'm sorry. 
РОСС: I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love. 
РОСС: Same difference. 
НЕДРУГ: All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board. 
РОСС: I get it! Well, that's that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you know what, I think you should go. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good. 
РОСС: Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you! 
РОСС: I could, yeah, I can do that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good! 
РОСС: I know, why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right! 
РОСС: Right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right! 
РОСС: Y'know-thanks! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here. 
РОСС: Yeah, well, nah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Wait, what? 
РОСС: Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well-well, I don't know Ross-really? 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that! 
РОСС: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! 
РОСС: Cool! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! 
РОСС: Come on! Here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah. 
РОСС: Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait-wait-wait! 
РОСС: You tell them to wait! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Wait! Wait! 
РОСС: Emily. 
РОСС: Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
