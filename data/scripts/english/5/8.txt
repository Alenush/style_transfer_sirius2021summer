РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
РОСС: I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
ДЖОУИ: I need something sweet.
ФИБИ: Does anyone wanna watch TV?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure.
ФИБИ: Monica your remote doesn't work.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
ФИБИ: Oh. Aw, forget it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
МОНИКА: That's very nice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's sweet, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
ДЖОУИ: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you aware that you're still talking?
МОНИКА: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
РОСС: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
ФИБИ: Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
РОСС: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
РОСС: Oh God, no.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
НЕДРУГ: Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
НЕДРУГ: More turkey Mr. Chandler?
РОСС: You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
ФИБИ: I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Worse than, More turkey Mr. Chandler?
ФИБИ: Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
НЕДРУГ: More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying. Oh no.
РОСС: In this life, Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
ДЖОУИ: Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
ФИБИ: Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
МОНИКА: Oh, let's not tell this story.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, come on!
ФИБИ: Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it's not like it sounds.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's exactly like it sounds.
ДЖОУИ: Hello?
ФИБИ: Hello?
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Joey? What's going on?
ДЖОУИ: Look.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: I know! It's stuck!
ФИБИ: Easy. Step. How did it get on?
ДЖОУИ: I put it on to scare Chandler!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
ДЖОУИ: Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
ФИБИ: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey, did you get the turkey basted. Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
ДЖОУИ: It's Joey.
МОНИКА: What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
ФИБИ: No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
МОНИКА: Well, get it off now!
ДЖОУИ: I can't! It-it's stuck!
МОНИКА: Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
ФИБИ: All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
МОНИКА: Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
ДЖОУИ: Sorry! Sorry.
МОНИКА: Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Arghhh!
ДЖОУИ: It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm over here big guy.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, there you are! I scared you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You did look like an idiot.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, Butternut squash? And it came out, Squatternut buash?
РОСС: Yeah that's the same.
МОНИКА: That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
ФИБИ: Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
НЕДРУГ: Which one?
МОНИКА: Umm, II really don't want to tell this story.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
МОНИКА: Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
НЕДРУГ: Monica! I think Rachel's here!
МОНИКА: I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
НЕДРУГ: Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, why? Why? What happened?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel!
НЕДРУГ: Happy Thanksgiving!
НЕДРУГ: You too sweethart!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my!
РОСС: Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
НЕДРУГ: Ross!
РОСС: Oh, this is Monica.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
РОСС: Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
НЕДРУГ: dammit!
РОСС: So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! No, not really.
РОСС: Well, that's cool. So did.
НЕДРУГ: Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
НЕДРУГ: I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
РОСС: Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
НЕДРУГ: Call them mom and dad you loser!
РОСС: Monica!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
НЕДРУГ: Okay!
НЕДРУГ: Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
НЕДРУГ: Oh that's so great!
НЕДРУГ: I know!
НЕДРУГ: Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
НЕДРУГ: Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
НЕДРУГ: I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
НЕДРУГ: I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
РОСС: So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Emotional Knapsack?
РОСС: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
РОСС: Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude, don't do that too me!
РОСС: All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
НЕДРУГ: No. No, thank you!
НЕДРУГ: Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
МОНИКА: Well, I do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
ФИБИ: Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
РОСС: I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
МОНИКА: Yes, it was!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it wasn't. It was actually the.
МОНИКА: Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
ФИБИ: Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
ФИБИ: Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
НЕДРУГ: So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hi!
НЕДРУГ: Wow, love your new nose!
НЕДРУГ: Jack.
НЕДРУГ: What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
НЕДРУГ: I'll get it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, God! Please, let me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
НЕДРУГ: God, your hair sure is different!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
РОСС: So uh, where's Monica?
НЕДРУГ: She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
МОНИКА: Hi, Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
РОСС: Dude!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry!
НЕДРУГ: Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
РОСС: Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
МОНИКА: So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
НЕДРУГ: Dude!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
МОНИКА: Well it didn't!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
МОНИКА: Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, that we may be able to do.
МОНИКА: How?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
МОНИКА: What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then, you will definitely get him back!
МОНИКА: Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
МОНИКА: What do you mean?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
МОНИКА: I can do that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
МОНИКА: Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I loveI love the way this box feels against my cheek.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, II like to pick up this knife and-and umm, II put the cold steal against umm, my body.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you all right?
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that.
НЕДРУГ: What do we got here?
НЕДРУГ: Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
РОСС: Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
НЕДРУГ: It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
НЕДРУГ: Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
НЕДРУГ: Did you bring the toe?
МОНИКА: Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
НЕДРУГ: Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and.
МОНИКА: What?! What is it?
НЕДРУГ: You brought a carrot.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You brought a carrot?!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
МОНИКА: God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
НЕДРУГ: It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Without my toe?! I need my toe!
МОНИКА: Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
МОНИКА: I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's why for an entire year people called me Sir LimpsALot?!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
МОНИКА: Chandler!
РОСС: Sir LimpsALot, I came up with that.
ДЖОУИ: You're a dork.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe this.
МОНИКА: Chandler, I said I was sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
МОНИКА: Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, Quack, quack! I’m happy all the time!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice try.
МОНИКА: Wait, wait, wait!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Monica.
МОНИКА: Look!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is not going to work.
МОНИКА: I bet this will work!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are so great! I love you!
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing! I said, I said You're so great and then I just, I just stopped talking!
МОНИКА: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I didn't!
МОНИКА: Yes, you did!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I didn't!
МОНИКА: You love me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
НЕДРУГ:  Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
