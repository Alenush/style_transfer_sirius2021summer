РОСС: Chandler! Chandler! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
МОНИКА: What are you doing?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
МОНИКА: Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
РОСС: What the hell are doing?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, what's-what's going on?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
ДЖОУИ: Dude! He's right there!
РОСС: I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! II cannot believe this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
МОНИКА: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
РОСС: My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
РОСС: What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
РОСС: You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, III'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
РОСС: Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
ДЖОУИ: I call Godfather!
РОСС: You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
ДЖОУИ: Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
МОНИКА: Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
ФИБИ: Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: So, are you ready to go?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
ДЖОУИ: Oh sure, right back there.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, where are we going to lunch?
ДЖОУИ: I was thinking Chinese food.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but.
МОНИКА: But what?
ДЖОУИ: She keeps punching me.
МОНИКА: In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
МОНИКА: I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I-Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
РОСС: Aww.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
РОСС: Huh.
ФИБИ: Bread, so you never go hungry.
РОСС: Ohh.
ФИБИ: And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
РОСС: Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
ФИБИ: Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah I'm president of the tenants committee.
РОСС: Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Mr. President.
НЕДРУГ: I came to talk to you about Howard.
РОСС: Howard?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
РОСС: Oh that's nice.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or.
РОСС: Oh. Uhh.
НЕДРУГ: Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
РОСС: No-no, it's not that, it's just II just moved in.
НЕДРУГ: Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
РОСС: Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay, I get it.
РОСС: No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. II mean I don't know Howard.
НЕДРУГ: Howard's the handy man!
РОСС: Yes but too me he's just, man.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
РОСС: Ugh, can you believe that guy!
ФИБИ: Yeah. I really like his glasses.
РОСС: so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds like a fun party.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
РОСС: It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
РОСС: Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PARTAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wh-wh-why?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not unless different means the same.
НЕДРУГ: You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
ДЖОУИ: Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
НЕДРУГ: No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. II really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
НЕДРУГ: Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
МОНИКА: Isn't this great?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hmm.
МОНИКА: Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
МОНИКА: Are you okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
МОНИКА: What-what are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
МОНИКА: Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!
МОНИКА: Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
МОНИКА: Oh and you know what I want!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
МОНИКА: I do not have baby fever!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
МОНИКА: Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
МОНИКА: You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I did not know that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: By me?
РОСС: Oh, no!
ДЖОУИ: No-no.
РОСС: Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, big!
ДЖОУИ: Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
МОНИКА: Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica.
МОНИКА: I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
МОНИКА: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's what we do. Y'know, II mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
МОНИКА: Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
НЕДРУГ: Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!
РОСС: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Oh, hi Ross!
РОСС: What are you doing?
ФИБИ: Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
НЕДРУГ: See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
РОСС: You chipped in?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
РОСС: Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
ФИБИ: Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
РОСС: Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
ФИБИ: No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's-I'm a hit!
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey, Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay, my bad.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Wow! You look, you look big.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
ДЖОУИ: Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Hiya!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya IIII think you are the one who is too much.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
НЕДРУГ: You're so sweet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, you're so sweet!
НЕДРУГ: Oww! Joey, she just kicked me.
ДЖОУИ: Huh.
НЕДРУГ: Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
ДЖОУИ: Uhh.
НЕДРУГ: You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
ДЖОУИ: Nah.
РОСС: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: That's what I'm saying.
РОСС: Phoebe? Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Ooh.
РОСС: Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
ФИБИ: No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
РОСС: So uh, what did you tell them about me?
ФИБИ: Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
РОСС: Ohh.
ФИБИ: But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
РОСС: What?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
РОСС: Ohh, this cake is really good!
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
НЕДРУГ: 3B!
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, aww!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, leave!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, get out! Now!
НЕДРУГ: Go back to 3B, 3B!
ФИБИ: All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, Who hear likes Ross, and he's wearing two nametags! II'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
ФИБИ: Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
РОСС: Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
МОНИКА: I'm Monica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
МОНИКА: Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica.
МОНИКА: No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will you marry me?
РОСС: Oh-no. No. No.
ДЖОУИ: What a bad idea!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
МОНИКА: Chandler, why are you doing this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
МОНИКА: Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
МОНИКА: Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
МОНИКА: Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
МОНИКА: Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
МОНИКА: Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: She's right y'know.
РОСС: Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
МОНИКА: Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't think I was!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
РОСС: No, I will not!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
РОСС: You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
ФИБИ: Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, how long is this going to go on.
МОНИКА: Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
РОСС: This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole We were on a break thing? Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not funny.
ДЖОУИ: That's not funny at all!
