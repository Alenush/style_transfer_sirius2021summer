ДЖОУИ: What are you doing? 
РОСС: I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. And top shelf: expired products. 
ДЖОУИ: Why are you doing this? 
РОСС: Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed? 
РОСС: Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?! 
РОСС: So what, we just sit? 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. Shhh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello, Chandler Bing. 
ДЖОУИ: Hello Mr. Bing...I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It’s been six months! It’s not funny! 
ДЖОУИ: But, I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! 
ДЖОУИ: And that’s Wednesday. Ohh. 
ФИБИ: Hey you guys, guess what? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The British are coming? 
ФИБИ: Ohh, you and your ways. Since it’s Christmas time. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city. 
МОНИКА: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. 
ДЖОУИ: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing? 
ФИБИ: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Danny. 
МОНИКА: Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks, Mon. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, of course. 
МОНИКА: Do you want to go out on a date with her? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica!!! 
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely! Is Friday okay? 
МОНИКА: Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait. 
НЕДРУГ: On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. I have a date with Danny. 
ДЖОУИ: How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available. 
ДЖОУИ: She’s a woman! 
НЕДРУГ: What can I say? She nailed it. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, is there anything else? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn. 
ФИБИ: Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: I just wanted to see how it's going. 
ФИБИ: Well, it's going okay. 
МОНИКА: Well good, here let me help you out. 
ФИБИ: Oh, thanks! 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Wow! 
ФИБИ: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. I guess. 
ФИБИ: Just get your nails done? 
МОНИКА: Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? 
ФИБИ: Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. 
ФИБИ: Thank you! And Happy Holidays. 
ФИБИ: Wait, you can't take the money out. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm making change. I need change for the bus. 
ФИБИ: But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm poor! I gotta take the bus! 
ФИБИ: Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still... 
НЕДРУГ: Bite me, blondie! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just... 
ДЖОУИ: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! 
РОСС: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys? 
ДЖОУИ: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it? 
ДЖОУИ: Wait a second, I could star in it! 
РОСС: Or that. 
ДЖОУИ: I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know. I can't do it. 
РОСС: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! 
РОСС: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks! 
РОСС: All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character. 
ДЖОУИ: Done! 
РОСС: And it can't be Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: It's not. 
РОСС: Or Joseph. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: Hey, what's up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. 
МОНИКА: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! 
МОНИКА: You had no relationship!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! 
МОНИКА: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan. 
МОНИКА: Come on, hurry! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how do you spell suspicious? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? 
ДЖОУИ: Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0. 
ДЖОУИ: You're driving me crazy with that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I'll stop. 
ДЖОУИ: Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna play? 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home. 
ДЖОУИ: All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm intrigued. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh yeah, right here. 
ФИБИ: Thank you, Happy Holidays. 
ФИБИ: Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash! 
ФИБИ: Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning! 
РОСС: All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid...Op! Op! 
РОСС: This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game! 
ДЖОУИ: You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work. 
РОСС: And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh! 
НЕДРУГ: I had a really nice time tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. 
НЕДРУГ: I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I thought I heard you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up! 
НЕДРУГ: Like it would help. 
НЕДРУГ: You are so bad! 
НЕДРУГ: You are! 
НЕДРУГ: You are! 
НЕДРУГ: You are! 
НЕДРУГ: You are! 
НЕДРУГ: You are! 
НЕДРУГ: You are! 
НЕДРУГ: You are so dead! I'm gonna get you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, it was very nice meeting you. 
ФИБИ: Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here. Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ФИБИ: Does it look like an ashtray? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ФИБИ: Does it look like a urinal? 
МОНИКА: Eww!! 
РОСС: So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what? 
ФИБИ: Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back, because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle? 
РОСС: Oh-oh, yeah. 
МОНИКА: All the time. In fact, I was undefeated. 
РОСС: Uh, you weighted 200 pounds. 
МОНИКА: Still, I was quick as a cat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway. 
МОНИКА: Oh, you're kidding. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal? 
МОНИКА: We don't, we don't wrestle now. 
РОСС: Yeah, not since I got too strong for you. 
МОНИКА: Too strong for me? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? 
РОСС: Oh fine. 
МОНИКА: Ready? Wrestle! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe! 
РОСС: Joey's not going. 
ДЖОУИ: I didn't finish my five pages. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why can't you do them tomorrow? 
РОСС: Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages. 
ДЖОУИ: Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. 
РОСС: I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. 
РОСС: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical! 
ДЖОУИ: Come on look guys, don't fight. 
РОСС: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? 
РОСС: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors! 
РОСС: How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I paid for those tickets! 
РОСС: No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: ...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When did that happen to you?! 
ДЖОУИ: Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture...I didn't have my camera! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, this is so good you have got to try it. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants. 
НЕДРУГ: Here, I'll get it. 
НЕДРУГ: We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set. 
НЕДРУГ: Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, bye! Oh my God!! 
МОНИКА: That was unbelievable! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, see? I told you! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, wow, sorry Rach. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't believe they're brother and sister. 
ДЖОУИ: They're brother and sister!!! 
ФИБИ: Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! 
ФИБИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner. 
ФИБИ: That chick can't handle my corner. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, either you leave, or we remove you. 
ФИБИ: Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! Why?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's... 
НЕДРУГ: Do-do you, do you have brothers? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy. 
НЕДРУГ: Are you close with them? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, they're not very nice people. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of... 
НЕДРУГ: Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? 
РОСС: Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today! 
РОСС: Yay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night! 
ДЖОУИ: No dude, Ross tore up the tickets! 
РОСС: I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. 
РОСС: All right. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross 
РОСС: Hey man. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is up? 
РОСС: About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted. 
РОСС: Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could I be more sorry. 
РОСС: I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry too. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going. 
РОСС: I am sorry, Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am sorry, Ross. 
ДЖОУИ: A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This took you all day?! 
ДЖОУИ: No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out. 
МОНИКА: Hi, how are you doing Kelly? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great! 
МОНИКА: It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick! 
МОНИКА: This is disgusting! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm not reading this! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
