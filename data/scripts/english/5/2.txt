ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
ДЖОУИ: All right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
МОНИКА: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke-Diet Coke.
ФИБИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Pheebs!
ДЖОУИ: Mornin' Pheebs!
ФИБИ: I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver.
ДЖОУИ: Was his name Angus?
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
ФИБИ: Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway.
МОНИКА: Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?

РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
РОСС: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: That was good beer.
РОСС: Ohh!
ДЖОУИ: Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
РОСС: Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
ДЖОУИ: Later!
РОСС: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
МОНИКА: Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
РОСС: Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
МОНИКА: No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
РОСС: Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, II did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
ФИБИ: So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
РОСС: No, not since I lost her at the airport.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe she can out run you man!
РОСС: HEY, SHE'S FAST! OKAY?! Oh! You-you think you can be-beat me? Let's go! Outside!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
РОСС: That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
РОСС: So, what? That's it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
РОСС: Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, you're the best.
РОСС: Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, Ross, when you make out card be sure to make it out to, EMILY.
МОНИКА: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying? I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that's not true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
ФИБИ: London is stupid! Stupid!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
ФИБИ: Oh, No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
МОНИКА: I'll do it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I gotta go to work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
МОНИКА: Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
МОНИКА: Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it.
МОНИКА: Ohh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean it's my fault.
МОНИКА: Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: Okay. That's okay. II know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
ДЖОУИ: I bet it was about her a little.
МОНИКА: If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda.
МОНИКА: Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
МОНИКА: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
ДЖОУИ: Say that to him and you're golden.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Pheebs!
МОНИКА: We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
ФИБИ: Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
ФИБИ: No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry.
МОНИКА: What happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
МОНИКА: See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well?
НЕДРУГ: Get out!
МОНИКА: What took you so long?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
МОНИКА: Oh, good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
ДЖОУИ: See ya! What the hell was that?!
МОНИКА: Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's not European!
ФИБИ: Well, it felt French.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, I really had a good time!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, hi!
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is Monica around? II have to ask her something.
РОСС: She's doing her laundry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's that?
РОСС: It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, honey that's awful.
РОСС: Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But, it's not raining.
РОСС: I can't catch a break!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
МОНИКА: Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? II dropped some socks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
МОНИКА: I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, II wanted to tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
МОНИКА: What?! You cannot tell him that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
МОНИКА: I make the decisions, and I say no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
МОНИКА: You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, I'm not fired! Ha!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well.
МОНИКА: Rachel! Come on! Let me in!
ДЖОУИ: Havin' some trouble?
МОНИКА: Rachel locked the door.
ДЖОУИ: I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
МОНИКА: Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
МОНИКА: Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
МОНИКА: I really need to talk to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then talk!
МОНИКА: Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes!
РОСС: What thing?
МОНИКА: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
РОСС: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm gonna do it.
МОНИКА: All right, Rachel, I knowI know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I.
МОНИКА: Please!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, fine.
МОНИКА: Joey, I'm in!
ДЖОУИ: All right. Good deal.
НЕДРУГ: Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, okay, Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
ФИБИ: Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
МОНИКА: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic, in Central Park!
ФИБИ: Central. Park!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, all of us! All day!
ФИБИ: That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? Well, it's right by my house, all right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just--y'know--stop it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
ФИБИ: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
МОНИКА: Makes me wanna puke!
РОСС: Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Pheebs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, woo!
ФИБИ: Okay, woo! Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little, Y'know, it didn't have any. It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
ФИБИ: Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
ДЖОУИ: Mine!
РОСС: Wait! It was my plan.
ДЖОУИ: Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
РОСС: And, I came up with Atlantic City.
ДЖОУИ: Which, is the new plan!
МОНИКА: Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
ФИБИ: Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
МОНИКА: Come on Rach, let's go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, y'know what? I'mI'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
МОНИКА: No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
МОНИКА: Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, II don't care.
МОНИКА: Okay. II can't watch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What 'cha readin'?
РОСС: The paper.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, what's it about?
РОСС: Events from around the globe.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
РОСС: Sure. Once, at work II thought carbon dating was fossilized.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Go ahead.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, okay, I think I'mI'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
РОСС: Wow. Umm. Huh? I'mI'm not sure what to do with that right now.
РОСС: What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
РОСС: Why are you laughing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because, because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when I said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, You are such an idiot!
РОСС: Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, that's not funny.
РОСС: Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. Hey Ross, where's the Mrs? Don't know!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
РОСС: Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
РОСС: That is what the thing is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
РОСС: No. No. No, I'mI'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
РОСС: No thank you for. Thank you.
РОСС: Okay, let's go!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Atlantic City!
ФИБИ: Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You're water broke!
НЕДРУГ: Ohh!
ФИБИ: All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
НЕДРУГ: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
РОСС: Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: High-five, the babies are coming!
ФИБИ: Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
МОНИКА: I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
МОНИКА: Do you know anything about women?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
МОНИКА: That's all right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
