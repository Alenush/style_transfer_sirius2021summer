РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good, you guys are all here! 
РОСС: Hey! What's up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow! 
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations! Ohh, that's great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! 
ДЖОУИ: Boy, that guy's underwear sucks! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh-what?! 
ДЖОУИ: I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me! 
ФИБИ: Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: You wanna work on your interview skills? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: O-okay! 
ФИБИ: Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
ФИБИ: Very good handshake, good wrist action. 
МОНИКА: Let me try. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! 
МОНИКА: Did I squeeze it too hard? 
ФИБИ: Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler. 
ДЖОУИ: That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before. 
МОНИКА: Is he doing his shark attack bit yet? 
ДЖОУИ: Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. 
ДЖОУИ: Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me. 
МОНИКА: Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor... 
МОНИКА: Wow! She is pretty, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck! 
РОСС: Hey Joey! Great stuff huh? 
ДЖОУИ: This is your place? 
РОСС: Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. 
ДЖОУИ: But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! 
ДЖОУИ: Ugh!! 
МОНИКА: What happened? 
ДЖОУИ: I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. 
МОНИКА: No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. 
НЕДРУГ: We've lost visual contact with the suspect. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, now I've really have to go! 
ФИБИ: But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk. 
НЕДРУГ: I know, but it's my job, sweetheart! 
ФИБИ: Okay, then maybe I can come too! 
НЕДРУГ: Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer. 
ФИБИ: All right, you go. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye-bye. 
ФИБИ: 'Kay, bye! 
ФИБИ: Oh God! 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: Oh I just miss him so much! 
МОНИКА: Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other. 
МОНИКА: I know it is the best. 
ФИБИ: So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler? 
МОНИКА: What? It's still going on. 
ФИБИ: Come on, seriously! When did it end? 
МОНИКА: I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time. 
ФИБИ: Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious. 
МОНИКА: What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!! 
ФИБИ: God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just...I misspoke. It's okay. 
МОНИКА: Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Monica, here's your broom back. 
МОНИКА: You are so cute. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey, how'd the interview go? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing! 
ДЖОУИ: Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh! 
ДЖОУИ: What happened? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh... 
ДЖОУИ: You kissed him?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I didn't know what else to do! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you coulda tried, not kissing him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks Chandler. 
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe it! I got a second interview! 
МОНИКА: Yes! 
ДЖОУИ: I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! No? 
МОНИКА: A kiss? What are you talking about? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!" 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on, Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him? 
МОНИКА: He probably wants you back because you're right for the job. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe. I-I don't know...Oh God, how could I be so stupid?! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you. 
ДЖОУИ: No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is! 
ДЖОУИ: Damnit!! Did you move?! 
РОСС: Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there? 
НЕДРУГ: No. I'm all alone. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl? 
НЕДРУГ: Daddy!! 
ДЖОУИ: Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Come on in. 
НЕДРУГ: It's really nice to see you again. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh Rachel, uhh... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Just ah... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me? 
НЕДРУГ: Here let me... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that? 
РОСС: You got ink on your lip. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh..... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm gonna say no. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight? 
ФИБИ: Oh we can't, we already have plans. 
МОНИКА: What are you doing? 
ФИБИ: Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie. 
МОНИКА: Oh, we're not seeing a movie! 
ФИБИ: You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go? 
МОНИКА: Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, yeah. 
МОНИКА: Okay. We have got to beat them! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? 
МОНИКА: 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh, so? 
МОНИКА: So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat. 
РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl. 
РОСС: Who isn't? 
РОСС: I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. 
РОСС: Nevermind! 
НЕДРУГ: No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in. 
РОСС: I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm... 
НЕДРУГ: Jen. 
РОСС: Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or... 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! That would be nice. 
РОСС: Umm? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call. 
РОСС: I will give you a call. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll see you later. 
РОСС: Okay! 
НЕДРУГ: I forgot my paper. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was amazing! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was amazing. 
МОНИКА: We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you're the best. 
МОНИКА: No, you're the best. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you're the best. 
МОНИКА: I am the best. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'? 
МОНИКА: Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. 
МОНИКА: Why? 
ДЖОУИ: Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left! 
ДЖОУИ: No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left. 
МОНИКА: No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong. 
ДЖОУИ: I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting. 
РОСС: So uhh, you ready? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that? 
РОСС: Sure. Joey... 
ДЖОУИ: Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again. 
НЕДРУГ: That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you. 
НЕДРУГ: Fair enough. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr... 
НЕДРУГ: Zelner. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it. 
НЕДРУГ: Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! You are? 
НЕДРУГ: Um-hmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that...I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so...Hey! I'll see you Monday! 
ФИБИ: You tired Chandler? 
МОНИКА: You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean. 
НЕДРУГ: So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so... 
МОНИКА: You didn't! 
ФИБИ: We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code! 
МОНИКА: The park huh? A public place. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. 
МОНИКА: I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! 
МОНИКА: Hi Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it? 
МОНИКА: Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous! 
МОНИКА: Come on, we can't let them win! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?! 
МОНИКА: Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off -each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So? 
МОНИКА: I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about? 
МОНИКА: Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. 
МОНИКА: That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship. 
МОНИКА: Did not. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out! 
МОНИКА: Okay, I freaked out a little. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe Ross is buying this! 
МОНИКА: Thank God! I can't watch him anymore! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You guys ready for the movies? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. 
РОСС: Man! They cannot get enough!
