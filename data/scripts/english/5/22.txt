ФИБИ: Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. 
ДЖОУИ: Great! Problem solved! 
ФИБИ: But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, back to square one. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.

МОНИКА: Oh that's an eye removal machine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I'm outta here! 
МОНИКА: I'm kidding! I'm kidding! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: So were done then! 
НЕДРУГ: Almost! But first, we gotta start. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: Sit down. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
МОНИКА: A small puff of air, now come on! 
НЕДРУГ: Here we go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: 1...2...3!

НЕДРУГ: That's okay. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay! 
НЕДРУГ: 1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great! 
НЕДРУГ: And I'll fit you for a glass eye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, just give me the damn drops! 
МОНИКА: Dr. Miller? P E C F D. 
НЕДРУГ: Very good Monica! You know where they are. 
МОНИКА: I sure do! And you don't get one! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better. 
МОНИКА: They're still in my coat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Damn! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! You ready to go? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: I love you. 
ДЖОУИ: Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him! 
ФИБИ: Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money? 
ДЖОУИ: Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss. 
ДЖОУИ: See ya! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! 
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

ДЖОУИ: Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once. 
ДЖОУИ: Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: You wanna eat? My treat! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Isn't that Ross's money? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Too dry. 
ДЖОУИ: Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
ДЖОУИ: Is this movie gonna be my big break? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude you said, "No!"

ДЖОУИ: You don't think this is going to be a big break for me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Ahhh!!! 
ДЖОУИ: I don't believe this! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high. 
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie! 
ДЖОУИ: Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break. 
ДЖОУИ: Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you don't want me on the trip? 
ДЖОУИ: Not if you're gonna be like this! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! I don't want you on the trip! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now! 
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Get out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge. 
ДЖОУИ: Get out!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here. 
РОСС: Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells? 
ФИБИ: No. 
РОСС: Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike? 
ФИБИ: No that made me feel precious. 
МОНИКА: Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who! 
РОСС: Yeah? Sometimes it's... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose. 
РОСС: Okay, I'm the baby. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eh! Stop it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Chandler! What are you doing here? 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge! 
НЕДРУГ: Why?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast. 
ФИБИ: That game should not be played without my supervision. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge. 
ФИБИ: What's in the bag? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg? 
ФИБИ: I do! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Not even close. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this! 
МОНИКА: Okay! All right! Let's do it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! 
МОНИКА: Sit down. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. 
МОНИКА: Put your head back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! 
МОНИКА: All right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Now, open your eyes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, they are. 
МОНИКА: How many fingers am I holding up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Four. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, I was thinking four. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! 
МОНИКА: Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! 
МОНИКА: No drops! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, well, you said it was practice! 
МОНИКА: Then why did you move?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because I knew you were lying! 
МОНИКА: All right, come here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! 
МОНИКА: I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica! Stop it! 
МОНИКА: Damn! It's empty! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! 
ФИБИ: Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel! 
МОНИКА: Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it. 
ДЖОУИ: Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests! 
МОНИКА: What did you do to his sweater vests? 
ДЖОУИ: Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. 
ФИБИ: Hey, dude! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it? 
ФИБИ: Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him! 
ФИБИ: Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me? 
МОНИКА: Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn... 
ФИБИ: No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
ФИБИ: Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison. 
РОСС: Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay? 
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. 
РОСС: What do you like better flora or fauna? 
ФИБИ: Fauna. 
РОСС: Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle? 
ФИБИ: Garfunkle. 
РОСС: Why are you mad at me? 
ФИБИ: You said I was boring--Ohh! 
РОСС: When did I say you were boring?! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess! 
РОСС: Phoebe! You and I have never played chess! 
ФИБИ: Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work. 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down. 
ДЖОУИ: Wh-what?! Why?! 
НЕДРУГ: It's a money thing, we don't have any. 
ДЖОУИ: You're kidding right? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, hang out?! How long? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
