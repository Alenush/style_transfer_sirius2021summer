ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you looking at naked tribe's women? 
ДЖОУИ: No, look. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a pig. 
ДЖОУИ: I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РОСС: Emily's cousin kicked me out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Why? 
РОСС: Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease? 
РОСС: Who needs a lease when it's family! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: You got it. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
РОСС: Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad. 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He thought you said gonad. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living. 
МОНИКА: Oh, Larry. 
ФИБИ: Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? 
НЕДРУГ: No, bribes. 
ФИБИ: It's okay to laugh right? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I was just kidding. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll check the kitchen floors. 
МОНИКА: Okay, knock yourself out, Larry. 
ФИБИ: Yum-my! 
МОНИКА: Larry? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors. 
НЕДРУГ: A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation. 
МОНИКА: Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen. 
НЕДРУГ: And where is your hat? 
МОНИКА: It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh that's the 2 points. 
ФИБИ: Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I don't know about that. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda. 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime. 
ФИБИ: Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat. 
НЕДРУГ: I-I'll call ya. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: He's so funny! 
МОНИКА: Thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Mon? 
МОНИКА: Hmm? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff. 
МОНИКА: He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced. 
МОНИКА: Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married. 
НЕДРУГ: Two pounds of Moca Java please. 
МОНИКА: Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, fun! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, great! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, see ya. 
МОНИКА: Well, I guess we won't be warming his house. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out. 
МОНИКА: And you're not gonna do that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it? 
МОНИКА: So-so there is no party. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me? 
МОНИКА: I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Exactly. 
ДЖОУИ: Ross? 
РОСС: Hey roomies! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Love what you've done with the place. 
РОСС: Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here. 
ДЖОУИ: Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't....I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! 
РОСС: Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, all right! 
РОСС: Pretty cool, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: You're fake laughing too, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, the tears are real. 
НЕДРУГ: You look beautiful this evening. 
ФИБИ: Show me the badge again. 
ФИБИ: Shiny. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been. 
ФИБИ: You are just nonstop! 
НЕДРУГ: We're outta here! 
ФИБИ: Why?! 
НЕДРУГ: Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down! 
ФИБИ: You have the power to do that? 
НЕДРУГ: This does. 
ФИБИ: Shut it down. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing? 
ДЖОУИ: Nothing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You built a fort didn't ya? 
ДЖОУИ: Kinda. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, you should've gone out once and a while. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I hate this thing! 
ДЖОУИ: Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi Danny. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night. 
МОНИКА: Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy. 
МОНИКА: You are? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, what's the gala for? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's a uh, regatta gala. 
НЕДРУГ: Really! You-you sail? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, but I support it. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Take care. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he? 
МОНИКА: What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat. 
МОНИКА: Great. So the ball is in his court? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ball? There is no ball. 
РОСС: Joey, please! 
ДЖОУИ: Sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: Ahhhhhhhhhh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello children! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand? 
ДЖОУИ: No, the quiet down thing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean this. 
ДЖОУИ: Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no! 
ДЖОУИ: YES!! 
РОСС: Uh fellas, 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so he's out of here. 
ДЖОУИ: Um-hmm. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down! 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?! 
МОНИКА: I don't know, clean places? 
ДЖОУИ: Umm, yum! 
МОНИКА: It's Danny. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala. 
МОНИКА: We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?! 
МОНИКА: The fake kind! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle? 
МОНИКА: We have a ladle. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks, see you at the party. 
МОНИКА: Okay, great! 
ФИБИ: Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? 
РОСС: I'll take sports. 
ДЖОУИ: Mine! 
РОСС: All right. Uhh, international. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian! 
РОСС: Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not even on page 7? 
РОСС: Oh yeah! You're...hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about that circled one? 
РОСС: Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio. 
ДЖОУИ: But it's available now! Isn't it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, it is. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, let's go look at it! 
РОСС: Okay, let's go. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There we go! 
РОСС: Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let's go quicker. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
РОСС: Oh my God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub. 
ДЖОУИ: Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place. 
РОСС: I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking. 
ДЖОУИ: But hey, Ross, this place is available now! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
РОСС: So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it's perfect! 
РОСС: How about you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a kitchen slash bathroom. 
РОСС: All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are bad people. 
ДЖОУИ: He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, ready for dinner? 
ФИБИ: Ooh, absolutely! 
НЕДРУГ: Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right? 
ФИБИ: Ooh, I love that place! So, no. 
НЕДРУГ: How about Mama Lisettie's? 
ФИБИ: Enh. Sure! 
НЕДРУГ: I wonder how long that milk has been setting out. 
ФИБИ: Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That...this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit? 
НЕДРУГ: But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?! 
ФИБИ: Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I suppose I could give him a warning. 
ФИБИ: Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes that was a nice place! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are we gonna do? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. Maybe pizza? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: About Ross! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Oh! 
ДЖОУИ: Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhhhh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there! 
МОНИКА: Just go over and say hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy. 
МОНИКА: Hey, Danny! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! What's going on? 
МОНИКА: Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this? 
НЕДРУГ: Salad. 
МОНИКА: Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this? 
НЕДРУГ: Bread. Aren't you a chef? 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime. 
НЕДРУГ: Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now? 
МОНИКА: I thought there wasn't a ball? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, go on! You telling people about me? 
НЕДРУГ: You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. 
НЕДРУГ: So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, okay, at ease solider! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try." 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park! 
МОНИКА: I think I need a drink. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 98. 99. 100. Okay, go! 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here we go! Here we go! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application. 
ДЖОУИ: You're kidding! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're kidding, no! 
РОСС: Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So.... 
ДЖОУИ: But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! 
РОСС: Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
РОСС: Are you guys sure about this? 
ДЖОУИ: Definitely! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Ross, you have to stay! 
РОСС: All right. 
ДЖОУИ: All right! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, buddy! 
РОСС: So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? 
РОСС: Come on, it's fun! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! Isn't this a woman's hat? 
ДЖОУИ: Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
