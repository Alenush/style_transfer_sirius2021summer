НЕДРУГ: unknown yet Transcribed by: Johannes Pohl 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what… 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?! 
МОНИКА: Really? Let's get past the moment. 
ФИБИ: What's your news? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you. I got a job in advertising. 
МОНИКА: Oh, honey, that's incredible! 
ФИБИ: Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people… come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you. 
РОСС: So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. 
ФИБИ: That's great. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Humiliating and noble! 
РОСС: You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising. 
МОНИКА: Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?" 
РОСС: Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon. 
МОНИКА: He just left. 
ДЖОУИ: Who did? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. 
ДЖОУИ: She did? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You got it! 
ДЖОУИ: I did? 
МОНИКА: What is she talking about? 
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, but it sounds great. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Your agent called. You got that audition. 
ДЖОУИ: With Lennart Haze? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time. 
МОНИКА: Is it a good play? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it… 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, and directing. 
МОНИКА: He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You saw that? 
МОНИКА: No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, he's done some amazing works. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. 
ДЖОУИ: I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. 
МОНИКА: Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition! 
ДЖОУИ: Don't make me more nervous than I already am! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good morning, everybody. 
НЕДРУГ: Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car. 
НЕДРУГ: Seriously, you're an intern? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom. 
НЕДРУГ: Dude! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The comedian? USO?! 
НЕДРУГ: Uhm, it's USA, sir. 
НЕДРУГ: This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze. 
ДЖОУИ: It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I've… I've been blessed with a… a lot of great roles. 
ДЖОУИ: Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!" 
НЕДРУГ: You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service. 
ДЖОУИ: No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role. 
ДЖОУИ: Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon… 
НЕДРУГ: Peeeeeooooooooch "Hang up that phone!" One take! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! 
НЕДРУГ: So, shall we read? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yah, sure. 
НЕДРУГ: Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it? 
НЕДРУГ: "What the hell are you still doing here"? 
ДЖОУИ: Err, "I think you know". 
НЕДРУГ: "Bastard"! 
ДЖОУИ: "I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now." 
НЕДРУГ: "Go, go!" 
ДЖОУИ: "I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't." 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause" 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a… 
НЕДРУГ: No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern "I could go right now, maaan!" 
НЕДРУГ: My god in heaven. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment? 
НЕДРУГ: You, you gotta be kidding. See, h-he, he can't act. . 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much. 
ДЖОУИ: I really doubt that. 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you. 
ДЖОУИ: Couldn't I just sleep with the producer? 
ФИБИ: Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? 
РОСС: Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I hear divorce bells. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: I have a gun 
РОСС: O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. 
НЕДРУГ: Alright, lady, now give me your purse! 
ФИБИ: No. 
РОСС: What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. 
ФИБИ: Lowell, is that you? 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe? Oh my god! 
ФИБИ: Oh my god! 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, nice to meet you. 
РОСС: Yeah, a real pleasure. 
ФИБИ: Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this! 
НЕДРУГ: Ough, I know, but I quit smoking! 
ФИБИ: Good for you! 
НЕДРУГ: So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you? 
ФИБИ: Ouh… 
РОСС: Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? 
ФИБИ: Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up… 
МОНИКА: Hey, how did the audition go? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. 
МОНИКА: What happened? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less. 
МОНИКА: So far so good! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, I'm old! 
МОНИКА: What's wrong? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them. 
МОНИКА: So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. 
ДЖОУИ: Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire! 
МОНИКА: What are they? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these. 
ДЖОУИ: I give you $ 500 for them! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What am I supposed to do with these? 
МОНИКА: Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these? 
МОНИКА: Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hey! 
РОСС: Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged! 
МОНИКА: You okay?! 
РОСС: Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! 
МОНИКА: How do you know a mugger? 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. 
РОСС: You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people. 
МОНИКА: Seriously? 
ФИБИ: Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I… 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, that is awful! 
ФИБИ: Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer… 
МОНИКА: You're mother killed herself! 
ФИБИ: She was a drug dealer! 
РОСС: Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage! 
ФИБИ: Okay… 
МОНИКА: Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross. 
ФИБИ: Why? 
МОНИКА: Well, Ross was mugged as a kid. 
ФИБИ: You were? 
РОСС: Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- 
МОНИКА: Wonderwoman! 
РОСС: Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone… … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!" 
ФИБИ: Oh my god… 
РОСС: I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy" 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah! What was his superpower again? 
РОСС: A superhuman thirst for knowledge. 
МОНИКА: That's it. 
РОСС: Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I think we have a problem here. 
МОНИКА: What? 
ФИБИ: Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. 
МОНИКА: Yeah? 
ФИБИ: Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. 
МОНИКА: So? 
ФИБИ: Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- 
НЕДРУГ: "Geology rocks!" 
МОНИКА: Oh my god! 
ФИБИ: I know… I mugged Ross! 
НЕДРУГ: You're late! 
ДЖОУИ: I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom? 
НЕДРУГ: No, Lennart doesn't wait! 
ДЖОУИ: But I'm bursting with u-hu! 
НЕДРУГ: Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly! 
ДЖОУИ: Actually, I really need… 
НЕДРУГ: We must go now, quickly, please. 
ДЖОУИ: Yes… ahahaaa 
НЕДРУГ: Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?" 
ДЖОУИ: "I think you know!" 
НЕДРУГ: "Oh, you sick bastard!" 
ДЖОУИ: "I am what you made me! You know what?" 
НЕДРУГ: "What?" 
ДЖОУИ: "I could go right now." 
НЕДРУГ: "Then go, go!" 
ДЖОУИ: "I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!" 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! That was good. That was very good. You did everything I asked for. 
ДЖОУИ: I did? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Plus… what you've got that… I don't know what you've got going… this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but – you know what? – more, more. Can you do that? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. 
НЕДРУГ: Look at that: still in character, I like it… I plant seeds I can't explain. 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: What are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, anything yet? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Probably wanna know what I'm doing…? 
МОНИКА: No, that seems about right. 
ДЖОУИ: Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, that was formula. 
ДЖОУИ: We gotta get more of that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what… these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright I feel youger already! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yah, I think I broke my hip. 
ФИБИ: Hey, you! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey, how was class? 
РОСС: No one ever asked me that, what's wrong? 
ФИБИ: Nothing, I really wanna know. 
РОСС: Oh… Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene… 
ФИБИ: Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid… 
РОСС: Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude. 
ФИБИ: You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. 
РОСС: No, it wasn't. 
ФИБИ: Yes, it was. 
РОСС: No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old… 
ФИБИ: "Gimme your money, punk!" 
РОСС: Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! 
РОСС: It's not the best! 
ФИБИ: I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say… 
РОСС: There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. 
ФИБИ: Really? Even more humiliating than… 
РОСС: Hey, let's not do this! 
НЕДРУГ: … and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other! 
НЕДРУГ: That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? Chander… 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay… You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age… 
НЕДРУГ: Your age? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!" 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, that's great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me 
НЕДРУГ: You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's…. You did you come up with that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow. 
НЕДРУГ: That is great. Good work! 
НЕДРУГ: See all of you tomorrow. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The cold weather hurts my hip! 
ФИБИ: Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? 
РОСС: Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. 
ФИБИ: I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. 
РОСС: Oh my god, crap from the street? 
ФИБИ: Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found "Science Boy" 
РОСС: Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years? 
ФИБИ: I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. 
РОСС: You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving! 
ФИБИ: Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. 
РОСС: Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him 
РОСС: You're welcome. 
ДЖОУИ: "I need an answer!" 
НЕДРУГ: "I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know." 
ДЖОУИ: "You know!" 
НЕДРУГ: "I don't know!" 
ДЖОУИ: "I need an answer now!" 
НЕДРУГ: "Alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is…" 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! 
НЕДРУГ: "She never loved me, she only loved you." 
ДЖОУИ: "You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!" 
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely amazing! The part is yours. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get… 
НЕДРУГ: Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it! You can relax now. Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house! 
РОСС: Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that… 
МОНИКА: … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. 
РОСС: I see. You didn't happen to tell… 
МОНИКА: … everybody we know? Yeah. 
РОСС: Great. Thanks!
