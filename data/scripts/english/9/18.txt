НЕДРУГ: Central Perk - Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Ross and Rachel are sitting on the sofas. Joey enters.
ДЖОУИ: Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
МОНИКА: Ok.
ДЖОУИ: Alright!
МОНИКА: But ehm what is it not?
ДЖОУИ: A place to entertain my lady friends.
МОНИКА: And what else is it not?
ДЖОУИ: A place to eat spaghetti.
МОНИКА: Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah Connecticut. Not West Virginia.
МОНИКА: Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
ДЖОУИ: Uh!
МОНИКА: Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
ФИБИ: Hey will you get me tickets too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
НЕДРУГ: yeah thats a great idea!
РОСС: No thanks!
ФИБИ: You don't wanna win the lottery?
РОСС: Uh sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Still on Amelia Earhart?
РОСС: The woman just vanished!
ДЖОУИ: Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
РОСС: No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I. I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
ДЖОУИ: I like those odds!
РОСС: Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll ask. Boohaki?
РОСС: Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
МОНИКА: How do you know she's gonna start talking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kinda like Joey.
ДЖОУИ: What's that now?
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica, Chandler, Rachel and Joey are in the kitchen.
МОНИКА: God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pie eating contest?
МОНИКА: Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
МОНИКА: That was a good day!
РОСС: They're towing your car, they're towing your car!
МОНИКА: I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
РОСС: They're towing a car. And I am seeing spots.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
ДЖОУИ: I was?
НЕДРУГ: Yes and you talked to her.
ДЖОУИ: I did?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She dropped off a casserole?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
МОНИКА: So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
РОСС: Yeah, uh, and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!
РОСС: Think he washed his hands?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's going on?
МОНИКА: Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh! Tough odds!
РОСС: Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
ДЖОУИ: Look who's coming around!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
ДЖОУИ: Did you get it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: One of the slots got filled.
ДЖОУИ: By you!?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
МОНИКА: Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there's two spots left right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one. Except I don't care about Charlie.
ФИБИ: Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
МОНИКА: Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
РОСС: A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
МОНИКА: Alright, who wants to do it?
ФИБИ: Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
МОНИКА: Ok, hey Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
ДЖОУИ: I'll do it! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
ФИБИ: I hope I win!
МОНИКА: Well, it doesn't really matter, you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
ДЖОУИ: I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else you know won't come true!
МОНИКА: Right!, but we know what you're wishing for!
ДЖОУИ: Can't really say!
МОНИКА: I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
ДЖОУИ: I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
НЕДРУГ: Please, just do it!
ФИБИ: One, two, three!
ДЖОУИ: I won, hey!
РОСС: You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah! That thing gets hot!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
РОСС: Uh, you're not gonna win.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape and you're gonna be all like oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai.
РОСС: Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can see the headline now: Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm.
РОСС: Why would I eat my own arm?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
МОНИКА: You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
РОСС: Why?
МОНИКА: Because I know that you think the lottery is boohaki but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
РОСС: You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here.
ФИБИ: Get a room!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
РОСС: I don't know, probably just invest it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh! Calm down.
ДЖОУИ: Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
РОСС: Oh, I'm sorry, did I say invest it? I meant be cool and piss it all away.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't really care about the Knicks.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You would do that? I never get picked!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
ДЖОУИ: You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
РОСС: Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll take this one too Uh. Mommy?
РОСС: Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel Mommy when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
РОСС: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me Daddy too.
ФИБИ: Oooh, I like that, daddy.
РОСС: I. I was just talking about Rachel.
ФИБИ: Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
РОСС: Well that depends, have you been a baaad gi, no I can't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear?. What? Susan got it? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him! Alright, bye.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
МОНИКА: Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's the boss's son.
МОНИКА: Come on, lottery!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
МОНИКА: Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, I have another idea!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, idea time is over.
ФИБИ: Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
МОНИКА: There are no tickets on the nightstand!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
МОНИКА: Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
МОНИКА: Chandler, sense the tone!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, well, well, look what mommy found!
МОНИКА: Ok, fine! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
ФИБИ: Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
РОСС: I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
МОНИКА: Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
РОСС: 3 minutes ago! I don't know why that's important.
ДЖОУИ: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
МОНИКА: When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
ДЖОУИ: I'll show you how.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your special tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
МОНИКА: Please, if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.
МОНИКА: Ahhh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me finish, however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!
МОНИКА: There's the man I married!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, believe me. If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
МОНИКА: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I want my tickets too! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
РОСС: Than I want mine, too! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
ФИБИ: Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.
МОНИКА: No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
ДЖОУИ: Oh!
ФИБИ: OOOOOHHHHH!
РОСС: Hey, hey!
ФИБИ: OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
ДЖОУИ: No, no!
ФИБИ: If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets!
НЕДРУГ: NO!
ФИБИ: Don't come any closer!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished.
ФИБИ: No, what's more important, your friends or money?
НЕДРУГ: Friends!
МОНИКА: Money! Friends.
ФИБИ: Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
МОНИКА: They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra.
РОСС: Monica!
ФИБИ: Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this. Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
РОСС: Go, go, go!
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Chandler's apartment.
ФИБИ: What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, we lost half of them.
ФИБИ: So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
РОСС: Weird, your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon.
ФИБИ: As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
МОНИКА: Oh, play them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, here we go!
НЕДРУГ: Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise I sh. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.
ФИБИ: Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler, it's Charlie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is.shhh!
НЕДРУГ: Listen, oh, it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want.
МОНИКА: Oh God, I am so sorry honey.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, she was just much better at job than me!
ФИБИ: Guys, the drawing is about to start!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
РОСС: Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
МОНИКА: Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But, let's go win the lottery. I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
МОНИКА: 131!
РОСС: Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl. Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi mum, put her back on!
ДЖОУИ: Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
НЕДРУГ: Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got that!
РОСС: Oh, we have one too!
МОНИКА: We are on a roll, people!
РОСС: Come on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
НЕДРУГ: And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7
МОНИКА: Check your numbers! Make me rich!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!
НЕДРУГ: Wow!
ДЖОУИ: And what did she say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She said gleba!
МОНИКА: Make me rich!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Isn't that amazing?
РОСС: Oh yeah, no no no that's great!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why-why aren't you more excited?
РОСС: Oh, Rach oh. gleba is not a word.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, but of course it is!
РОСС: Okay, what does it mean?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know all the words.
РОСС: I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words.
РОСС: Yes you did, gleba is a word!
РОСС: Ok, use it in a sentence.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Emma just said gleba!
РОСС: It's not a word!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up.
РОСС: Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba. Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
РОСС: She's gonna be a scientist!
ДЖОУИ: Damnit! anybody got anything?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
ФИБИ: I'm still looking through mine.
МОНИКА: Just double checking no, no, no. No!
МОНИКА: Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, the I'm sorry I rejected you phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature, farts, boobies, butt cracks!
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, congratulations!
МОНИКА: Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
МОНИКА: You bet! No TV or anything!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that is so great about the job.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks, man.
ДЖОУИ: And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? What?
ДЖОУИ: Well, before, with the wishbone. I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
РОСС: Me too. So much for my dinosaur Amelia Earhart theme park.
ФИБИ: You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
НЕДРУГ: Seven.
ФИБИ: We won.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: We won!
МОНИКА: Let me see!
ФИБИ: Don't tear it.
РОСС: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
ФИБИ: I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
ФИБИ: I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your 3?
ФИБИ: It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
МОНИКА: You know what? You can have mine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me too.
ДЖОУИ: Me too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me too.
РОСС: I guess if everybody else is.
НЕДРУГ: Central Perk. They're all sitting there as usual, except Joey. Gunther is serving a nearby table.
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
ФИБИ: I beg to differ.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won 10,000.
ФИБИ: Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her.
