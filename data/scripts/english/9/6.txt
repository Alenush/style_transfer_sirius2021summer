ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello? Hello? 
МОНИКА: I LOVE MY NEW JOB! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, you're screaming. 
МОНИКА: YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's great. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Awesome. 
МОНИКА: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. 
НЕДРУГ: This is nice. 
ФИБИ: I know! 
НЕДРУГ: You need both hands for that? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this? 
ДЖОУИ: Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation. 
НЕДРУГ: Is it? 
ФИБИ: Maybe not, is it? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there... 
ФИБИ: I know Mike, why don't you keep digging? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sorry. 
ФИБИ: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars. 
НЕДРУГ: It's to my apartment. 
ФИБИ: Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because... 
ФИБИ: Oh no, I want to. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank God. 
ФИБИ: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. 
НЕДРУГ: Is this cool, huh? 
ФИБИ: It really is. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her. 
НЕДРУГ: I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us? 
НЕДРУГ: Not really. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... 
РОСС: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. Do you guys do random drug testing? 
РОСС: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that. 
НЕДРУГ: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny. 
РОСС: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, the blonde with no bra? 
РОСС: She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay... 
НЕДРУГ: Hi... I'm Sandy. 
РОСС: And she's a little mannish... 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! David! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time? 
ФИБИ: No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing. 
ФИБИ: Who cares, it got you here. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it. 
ФИБИ: Wow. Where is your luggage? 
НЕДРУГ: Damn it! 
ФИБИ: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company. 
НЕДРУГ: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow! 
ФИБИ: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good. 
НЕДРУГ: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? 
ФИБИ: No... 
ФИБИ: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike? 
МОНИКА: Maybe he didn't give you a chance. 
ФИБИ: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no... 
МОНИКА: Oh, well... That had been your window. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible. 
МОНИКА: Really? The scientist guy? 
ФИБИ: Really? Chandler? 
МОНИКА: Continue... 
ФИБИ: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys? 
ФИБИ: Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am. 
МОНИКА: What are you gonna do? 
ФИБИ: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong... 
МОНИКА: You have to tell David! 
ФИБИ: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside! 
МОНИКА: Heeeeeey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch. 
МОНИКА: Was your cabin pressurised? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right? 
МОНИКА: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he came up... 
МОНИКА: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were you there? 
ФИБИ: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny... 
НЕДРУГ: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sandy, that's exactly what it is... 
РОСС: Are you gay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! 
НЕДРУГ: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
НЕДРУГ: Her name is Deliah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's pretty. 
РОСС: So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny? 
НЕДРУГ: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child. 
РОСС: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... 
РОСС: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him... 
РОСС: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. 
РОСС: Because, it's weird! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? 
РОСС: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes? 
РОСС: King? 
НЕДРУГ: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please? YES! Sandy you're hired. 
НЕДРУГ: That's great! I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here. 
РОСС: You gotta be at least bi... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks. 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it. 
ДЖОУИ: I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met. 
ДЖОУИ: Seriously? She actually said that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset? 
ДЖОУИ: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Without that, you just got "lame with women". 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ye.... 
МОНИКА: Hi! There you are. 
ДЖОУИ: Fire trucks! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday. 
ФИБИ: Oof... 
НЕДРУГ: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. 
ФИБИ: Oh, wait, wait! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I... 
ФИБИ: No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh... oh... 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I should have told you. 
НЕДРУГ: No... well, yeah. 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy? 
ФИБИ: I am happy. 
НЕДРУГ: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go... 
ФИБИ: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. 
НЕДРУГ: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye? 
ФИБИ: Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate... 
НЕДРУГ: No... no... 
ФИБИ: I mean... 
НЕДРУГ: In Minsk... 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips. 
ФИБИ: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... Oh boy... Hi... 
РОСС: Is everything allright? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't... I can't hear it again. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, I can't tell it again... 
РОСС: And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Excuse me... 
РОСС: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all. 
РОСС: Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby? 
РОСС: Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sandy made Madeleines. 
РОСС: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. 
РОСС: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? 
ФИБИ: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad. 
НЕДРУГ: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing. 
ФИБИ: No, no. No. 
НЕДРУГ: But... ergo... 
ФИБИ: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him... 
НЕДРУГ: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... 
НЕДРУГ: Well... hey, the key works...! 
ФИБИ: And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you. 
РОСС: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! I think that's great! 
РОСС: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines? 
МОНИКА: Oh... How are they? 
РОСС: Lighter than air... But that's not the point. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny. 
ДЖОУИ: Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird... 
РОСС: Thank you! 
ДЖОУИ: That's like a woman wanting to be a... 
РОСС: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence? 
МОНИКА: Yes... What is the end of that sentence? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, so? 
РОСС: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Really? Do you not know Chandler? 
МОНИКА: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey... 
ДЖОУИ: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... 
РОСС: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...? 
ДЖОУИ: ...No... 
МОНИКА: I can't believe he's that upset about this... 
ДЖОУИ: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Heeeyy! Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you guys talking about? 
РОСС: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. 
МОНИКА: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. 
МОНИКА: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is so funny about that? 
МОНИКА: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you tell her what we talked about? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? 
МОНИКА: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me? 
МОНИКА: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside. 
МОНИКА: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me. 
РОСС: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! 
ДЖОУИ: Not knowing when to shut up... 
РОСС: Yep! That's my thing... 
НЕДРУГ: So... how many guys have your key? 
ФИБИ: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend. 
НЕДРУГ: Your lipstick's on his mouth. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade. 
ФИБИ: No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days. 
НЕДРУГ: Did you uhm... 
ФИБИ: No, no... 
НЕДРУГ: ...kiss him? 
ФИБИ: Oh, well, yeah... 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. 
НЕДРУГ: Don't point your finger at me. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it? 
НЕДРУГ: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... 
ФИБИ: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go. 
НЕДРУГ: Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... well, you just better watch out. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you're going to Minsk? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I might. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there. 
ФИБИ: Okay, well... guys? 
НЕДРУГ: Right... Goodbye Phoebe. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, what are you kidding me? 
НЕДРУГ: Right-o, right-o... Take good care of her. 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand. 
НЕДРУГ: It's never gonna happen again right? 
ФИБИ: Right! Never! Never! I swear! 
НЕДРУГ: I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns. 
РОСС: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice. 
ДЖОУИ: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... 
РОСС: I swear to God...! 
НЕДРУГ: Who's up for puppets? 
ДЖОУИ: Me! I'm up for puppets! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus? 
РОСС: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets? 
НЕДРУГ: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. 
ДЖОУИ: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. 
РОСС: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That was kind of rude! 
РОСС: Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know, he was just doing his job... 
РОСС: Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on Ross... 
РОСС: No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... That's true. 
РОСС: Thank you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. 
НЕДРУГ: So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare... 
ДЖОУИ: I am learning so much from you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com. 
МОНИКА: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people! 
МОНИКА: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you too. And... I like you as a friend. 
ДЖОУИ: Allright. See you later! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See ya! 
ДЖОУИ: Did that guy really make that joke? 
МОНИКА: Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out. 
РОСС: Here goes... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. 
РОСС: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh... 
РОСС: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: YOU! You feel! 
РОСС: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, damn you Geller! 
РОСС: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings. 
НЕДРУГ: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future. 
РОСС: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue. 
НЕДРУГ: What is it...? Please...? 
РОСС: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you. 
НЕДРУГ: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is? 
РОСС: Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father? 
НЕДРУГ: hmmm... 
РОСС: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh ha ha! 
РОСС: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive. 
НЕДРУГ: That must have been hard. 
РОСС: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy? 
НЕДРУГ: But you are a real boy! 
РОСС: I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top? 
НЕДРУГ: It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out. 
РОСС: Here come some more... 
НЕДРУГ: And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink? 
НЕДРУГ: What kind? 
НЕДРУГ: A friend-ship... 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! You blow my mind... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I gotta go. 
ДЖОУИ: Aaahh... How much do I owe you? 
НЕДРУГ: Twenty bucks. 
ДЖОУИ: It's like the cheapest college ever.
