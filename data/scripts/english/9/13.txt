ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we can we talk about what happened here last night?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever.
РОСС: OK you you really don't know what I am talking about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
РОСС: OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said.
РОСС: Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum. I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So are you gonna talk to her?
РОСС: Why. Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know when That's fine sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
РОСС: No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but at least she could have told me. You know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
РОСС: I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
РОСС: Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why did I get married?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I.
ФИБИ: Well it depends.
ДЖОУИ: On?
ФИБИ: On how far along he's in the sex change process!
МОНИКА: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,
ДЖОУИ: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
ФИБИ: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too.
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
ФИБИ: Wow! Talking about high maintenance.
ДЖОУИ: Hey hey! You dye your hair!
ФИБИ: I'm a woman!
ДЖОУИ: Arghhh! Double standards!
ФИБИ: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
МОНИКА: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
ФИБИ: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out.
МОНИКА: It's just, I'm not good at singing.
ФИБИ: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
МОНИКА: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
ФИБИ: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
МОНИКА: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
ФИБИ: While drinking.
МОНИКА: I'm there!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
ФИБИ: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
ФИБИ: Oh my god.
МОНИКА: You kissed him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and.
МОНИКА: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
ФИБИ: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah. So how did you end up kissing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf.
МОНИКА: I thought you hated him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line is a scarf!
МОНИКА: So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just. I don't.
МОНИКА: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Or. I could call in sick and not deal with it at all.
ФИБИ: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
НЕДРУГ: Name?
ДЖОУИ: Chandler Bing.
НЕДРУГ: Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.
ДЖОУИ: OK Thanks.
НЕДРУГ: I'll take care of it.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
НЕДРУГ: Oh absolutely.
ДЖОУИ: Oh good.
НЕДРУГ: Are you looking to meet somebody?
ДЖОУИ: All right let's just do this.
НЕДРУГ: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit.
ДЖОУИ: Please I have an extremely high threshold. Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face! I'm all right! I'm all right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
РОСС: Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,
РОСС: That's funny. Do you think you'll ever work again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
РОСС: I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe she didn't move on, you know maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.
РОСС: No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she go out with him?
РОСС: No. When he called, I. I threw the message away.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah! The high road.
РОСС: You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
РОСС: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You you break the.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought I had to make the jokes!
РОСС: Don't you have to be at work?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.
РОСС: Hum. So hum. Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper another flood in Europe? Here’s a question: Would you.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry we were just leaving.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We still got it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who is it?
НЕДРУГ: Gavin! I brought you some soup.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?
НЕДРУГ: I heard you were sick.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.
НЕДРУГ: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no no no.
НЕДРУГ: So I had fun last night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So did I.
НЕДРУГ: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's just a cold.
НЕДРУГ: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What's the matter?
НЕДРУГ: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
НЕДРУГ: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! But you said not to worry about.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
НЕДРУГ: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right, right, yes!
НЕДРУГ: Don't panic!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
НЕДРУГ: Hello! I just go and get Emma.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK.
НЕДРУГ: So hum. Why did I have to hide?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I thought it was Ross.
НЕДРУГ: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There isn't. There is totally isn't.
НЕДРУГ: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Look. Gavin. I. I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in.
НЕДРУГ: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
НЕДРУГ: Don't be. It's just bad timing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So seriously rodeo clown?
НЕДРУГ: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best.
ФИБИ: No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world.! Thank you!
НЕДРУГ: Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth.
ФИБИ: Hi hi. Oh you have got to sing.
МОНИКА: No I told you I can't.
ФИБИ: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
МОНИКА: What have you heard me sing?
ФИБИ: All the time when you're cooking.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah you're always singing Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy.
МОНИКА: Yeah I do rock that one.
ФИБИ: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
МОНИКА: Just a little but it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing.
НЕДРУГ: Well I've got a book around.
МОНИКА: Delta Dawn.
РОСС: Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace.
НЕДРУГ: You already hit on me an hour ago.
РОСС: Right, so that's a firm no. I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.
РОСС: This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: By drowning or?!
НЕДРУГ: Why would he break up with me?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know sweetie.
НЕДРУГ: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well.
РОСС: I know!
НЕДРУГ: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of I touch myself. Coming up next we've got Monica.
МОНИКА: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
ФИБИ: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone.
МОНИКА: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing Delta Dawn.
ФИБИ: Can you totally see through her shirt?
НЕДРУГ: Like an XRay. Bad day not to wear a bra.
МОНИКА: To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I need your help.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
ДЖОУИ: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
ДЖОУИ: You may be a sissy but I'll still. All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
ДЖОУИ: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. First of all, this is green!
ДЖОУИ: What the hell am I supposed to do!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
ДЖОУИ: What, what.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor Victoria!
ДЖОУИ: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
МОНИКА: Take me to the mansion in the sky-y. I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
ФИБИ: Every little bit of you!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that.
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ФИБИ: Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but.
МОНИКА: Good? Didn’t you hear them. I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.
НЕДРУГ: Also a good gift? Underwear.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do.
РОСС: But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it.
НЕДРУГ: It’s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it’s like you lose a boyfriend,
РОСС: Uh-ah!
НЕДРУГ: No don’t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
РОСС: Good choice Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you everywhere!
РОСС: Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a.
РОСС: Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who?
РОСС: Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’ve being seeing someone?
РОСС: Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this.
НЕДРУГ: What are you taking amoxicillin for?
РОСС: How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that’s.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, who is Emma?
РОСС: I told you about my daughter.
НЕДРУГ: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And done!
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you so much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No problem.
ДЖОУИ: Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Comb my eyelashes.
МОНИКА: Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer.
ФИБИ: Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see Joey.
МОНИКА: Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? In front of all this people?
МОНИКА: And they love me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Yes, she gives the people what they want.
МОНИКА: All right, watch!
МОНИКА: Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are those my wife’s nipples?
ФИБИ: Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I gotta stop this.
МОНИКА: Oh, who cares, they still love me! I am so excited.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You, touching yourself, out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. She does that a lot!
НЕДРУГ: Ross, you didn’t tell me you were a doctor!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like.
НЕДРУГ: Actually about an hour and a half.
РОСС: I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
НЕДРУГ: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
РОСС: Are you kidding?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
РОСС: We’ll see.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
РОСС: I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How do you know about that?
РОСС: Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep.
НЕДРУГ: Emma.
РОСС: When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
НЕДРУГ: No, actually, see I had to pee, ‘cause I can’t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
РОСС: Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go.
НЕДРУГ: Well, call me!
РОСС: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: No, wait, you don’t have my phone number!
РОСС: You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it. Bye, bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Score.
РОСС: Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
РОСС: Oh, really!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Oh, really!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah.
РОСС: What about the guy from the bar?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Who?
РОСС: The guy you gave your number to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa, how do you know about that?
РОСС: Because he called here looking for you. So don’t tell me this this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why didn’t I get that message?
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?
РОСС: Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you do you not look there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross?
РОСС: I never gave it to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?
РОСС: I don’t know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
РОСС: Who am I?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes.
РОСС: I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you.
РОСС: None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the point. Ok? The point is you you are the one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they.
РОСС: Uh, clearly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,
РОСС: Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
ДЖОУИ: Ha, oh, of course.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: Your eyebrows look weird.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: “Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him.
