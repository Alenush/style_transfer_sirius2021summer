НЕДРУГ: Scott Silveri 
ФИБИ: Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead. 
ДЖОУИ: Thursday? But that's Halloween. 
ФИБИ: So? 
ДЖОУИ: So spooky, that's all. 
РОСС: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner? 
ФИБИ: No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Ugh, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner? 
ФИБИ: Oh, Rachel! 
РОСС: Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go. 
ФИБИ: Oh, yay! 
РОСС: Thanks, I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift. 
ФИБИ: Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That's fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time. 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? We're all together right now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, Mon, Chandler's not here. 
МОНИКА: Oh, dear God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it? 
НЕДРУГ: That's right. Is it true the reason you're here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started by taking a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. Would you like one? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not. 
НЕДРУГ: That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I always liked you, Ken. 
ФИБИ: Trick or treat! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, and treat it is. 
МОНИКА: Hmhmm. 
ФИБИ: Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts. 
МОНИКА: This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner. 
ФИБИ: Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you? 
МОНИКА: Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there. 
ФИБИ: 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all common areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people. 
ФИБИ: You smoked! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! I just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called leihalalokos. 
ФИБИ: Chandler, you stink of cigarettes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, do you think, Monica's gonna be able smell it? 
ФИБИ: Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ... and the breasts of a great goddess... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: I'm gonna go. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented! 
МОНИКА: Welcome home. I've missed you. Join me in the bedroom? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No thanks, I'm good. 
МОНИКА: OK, so you wanna play it that way, do you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. You know what? Actually I just got off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower. 
МОНИКА: You don't need a shower. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences. 
МОНИКА: What do I smell? I smell smoke. Hon, did you smoke? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packs...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore. 
МОНИКА: 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But, those are for you. 
РОСС: Alright, we'll just, uh, see you when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma. 
РОСС: Oh, what were the other two? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going. 
РОСС: I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She is? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What about Monica. 
РОСС: Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just don't think I can bear it. 
РОСС: Rachel, I know that you can. And you should. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm. 
РОСС: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I'll wait for my mom, and then I'll meet you there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ah... 
РОСС: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You need to learn some new slang. 
РОСС: I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait ... Oh! 
РОСС: No! No, you know what? You're not going back in there, the baby's fine, now scram. Yeah, tell your story walking. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was just going to say that I left my keys. 
РОСС: Oh, Holy moly, are we in a pickle now. 
ФИБИ: Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late. 
ДЖОУИ: I know. 
ФИБИ: I'm starving. I knew we were coming here tonight, so I ate nothing all day. 
ДЖОУИ: What about me, huh? Only had one lunch today. 
НЕДРУГ: So, are we expecting the rest of our party shortly? 
ФИБИ: Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable. 
ДЖОУИ: No, they're coming, we're waiting right here. 
ФИБИ: Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long. 
НЕДРУГ: It's just that we do have some large parties waiting. 
ФИБИ: One really does have a stick up one's ass, doesn't one. 
МОНИКА: How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad where the little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking. 
МОНИКА: So what? Don't you have any will power? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will power? I've watched home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tinfoil off. 
МОНИКА: You said that was sexy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again. 
МОНИКА: That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You forbid me? 
МОНИКА: Um-hm. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife...is she here, by the way? 
МОНИКА: Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be? 
МОНИКА: Yes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then, I might as well do this Not really sure what to do now. 
МОНИКА: Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine. What?!? 
МОНИКА: Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and if we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're serious? 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking. 
МОНИКА: Huh, and no cuddling. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And no kissing your neck. 
МОНИКА: Oh good, I hate it when you do that 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And lots of kissing your neck! 
РОСС: Okay, well the superintendant is not home. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
РОСС: Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something...knock that door down! 
РОСС: I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What if she jumped out the basinet? 
РОСС: Can't hold her own head up, but yeah, jump out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I left the water running. 
РОСС: Rach, you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, did I leave the stove on? 
РОСС: You never cooked since 1996. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there. 
РОСС: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think .. listen, listen! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh? 
РОСС: A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no, no, an eagle flew in! Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby in its talons. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still ablaze are locked in a death grip, swirling around in the whirl pool that fills the apartment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
НЕДРУГ: It's been an hour. Would you be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table? 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe we should just eat now. 
НЕДРУГ: You can't order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, OK, what's the restaurant's policy about people eating that? 
НЕДРУГ: Strange man. 
ДЖОУИ: But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom. 
ФИБИ: No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I'll cave. 
ДЖОУИ: If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. 
НЕДРУГ: Good evening, Miss. Miss? Miss? Miss! 
ФИБИ: Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. . 
ДЖОУИ: Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell...ahhh! 
МОНИКА: Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I can't do this. I can't make love to you while we're fighting this way. 
МОНИКА: Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was a celebration of life! Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want our baby to be conceived? 
МОНИКА: No, you're right. We shouldn't do it like this. Huh. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, it's not the end of the world. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean it? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are incredible. I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. 
МОНИКА: Do you want to? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, let's celebrate life! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God, Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. 
РОСС: Great. So let's get going? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again. 
НЕДРУГ: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his willie between his legs and cried out: "Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you." 
РОСС: Somehow, over time, it got easier to be apart from you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh. You are welcome. 
МОНИКА: You know what? Let's not talk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: Ooh, I am still so mad at you for smoking. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes, no big deal. 
МОНИКА: Oh, blah blah blah blah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe it. 
МОНИКА: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You tricked me to get me into bed? 
МОНИКА: That's right, I got mine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I feel so used. 
ФИБИ: Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order? 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. Waiter! All right, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up. Risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden ??? and a Bordelaise sauce, unless any of that stuff I just said means snails. 
НЕДРУГ: It doesn't. 
ФИБИ: Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, they're both exquisite. 
ФИБИ: Both it is, thank you. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request? Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, hi, hi! 
НЕДРУГ: I'll just wait to put your order in. 
ФИБИ: You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two? 
РОСС: I'm so sorry ... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We got locked out of the apartment, we ... 
ДЖОУИ: That's a great story. Can I eat it? 
РОСС: And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do. 
ФИБИ: And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, this is for the best, this way I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up! 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you. 
РОСС: Thanks. Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have? 
ДЖОУИ: Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman. 
РОСС: Y'know this ??? is incredible. 
ДЖОУИ: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach. 
РОСС: Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I'll have the soup and the salmon. 
ДЖОУИ: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ... 
МОНИКА: Happy birthday! 
ДЖОУИ: Son of a bitch! 
ФИБИ: Where, where have you been? 
МОНИКА: Well, we had a little fight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I would never lie to get someone into bed. 
МОНИКА: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How come you didn't get a bigger table? ...You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll give you another minute. 
ДЖОУИ: Why are you going? He said she wanted the shrew! 
РОСС: Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean the willie story? 
РОСС: Huh-huh, they already know it! 
ФИБИ: You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order. 
ДЖОУИ: No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want. 
МОНИКА: Why would you do that? 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, control your woman! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock. 
ФИБИ: Aw ... what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, Emma dropped her sock. 
МОНИКА: Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground. 
ФИБИ: It's a good toast. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Could you please get her attention? 
РОСС: Mommy! 
ФИБИ: Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now. 
РОСС: Well, I don't think that's us. 
ФИБИ: Well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, what is going on with you two? 
МОНИКА: Um, you see, I'm ovulating. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed. 
МОНИКА: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her. 
ДЖОУИ: So? You had sex, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl? 
ФИБИ: Okay, that was Mike. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration. 
ФИБИ: Huh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, okay, I'm gonna take off. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home? 
РОСС: You know, I think that's a good idea. Our babysitter just pounded down another Chardonnay. Bye, you guys. 
МОНИКА: Bye. 
ДЖОУИ: See ya. Well, this is just us. 
НЕДРУГ: Mhum. 
МОНИКА: So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you? 
ДЖОУИ: Do, you gonna go do it now? 
МОНИКА: We don't have much time. Once the egg decends into the ovaries .. 
ДЖОУИ: No, no . Monica and Chandler leave, the waiter comes) 
НЕДРУГ: I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning. 
ДЖОУИ: Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, huh. You boys are about to see something really special. 
НЕДРУГ: How was everything, sir? 
ДЖОУИ: Excellent. The shrew in particular was exquisite . 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I hope you've got some room left. 
НЕДРУГ: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ... 
ДЖОУИ: Joey! Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: ... Joey, happy birthday to you. 
ДЖОУИ: This is the best birthday ever.
