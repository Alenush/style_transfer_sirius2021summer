ДЖОУИ: God, you're beautiful, why are we fighting this? You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
ДЖОУИ: I want you. I need you. Let me make love to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ehm. I'm. I'm rehearsing my lines. They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Woow! I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that was a disappointment. Oh, hey! D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you serious?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, that was an honest mistake!
ДЖОУИ: Right! Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, that was an awesome day!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hi!
МОНИКА: So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
ФИБИ: Sure!
РОСС: I'd love to!
МОНИКА: Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
ФИБИ: Well, I can't give you a massage, because my license has been revoked again!
РОСС: Phoebe, what happened?
ФИБИ: Well, it was an accident. You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have I got a surprise for you! Pack your bags!
ФИБИ: Oh no! You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont!
ФИБИ: Oh, good! Ok, good for you! Try to recapture the magic!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
МОНИКА: Oh, honey! I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you really that busy?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's ok. I'll just try and reschedule. Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it. Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?
МОНИКА: Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
ФИБИ: And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok? Oh, thank you very much! Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.
РОСС: Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't have travel insurance.
РОСС: Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
МОНИКА: Why don't you take Ross?
РОСС: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn.
МОНИКА: No, not if their room has two beds!
РОСС: I guess. It still seems a little, moonlight boat ride!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please! Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm. OH MY GOD! Is that Christian Sanders? He's so gorgeous!
ДЖОУИ: Also so gay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, in my head he's done some pretty not-gay-stuff!
ДЖОУИ: Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
НЕДРУГ: Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, wish me luck!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, not that you need it but good. GOD! Is that Chase Lassiter? He's straight, right?
ДЖОУИ: Rach, I gotta say, if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry, good luck!
НЕДРУГ: On a bell please! Quietly, and ACTION!
НЕДРУГ: Drake! What are you doing in here?
НЕДРУГ: Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
НЕДРУГ: Get out!
НЕДРУГ: You don't love him!
НЕДРУГ: What do you know about love?
НЕДРУГ: I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
НЕДРУГ: That kiss never happened.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, what about this one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH!
НЕДРУГ: No, I told you, get out!
НЕДРУГ: Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question.
НЕДРУГ: You look familiar, have we.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: SSSHHHHTTT! He's asking her a question!
НЕДРУГ: Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
НЕДРУГ: I don't have a choice.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, you do. Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I, because I can't stop loving you.
НЕДРУГ: Don't say that.
НЕДРУГ: Tell me to stop, just, tell me to stop.
НЕДРУГ: CUT!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: NO! Or, cut! You know, that's your call!
НЕДРУГ: Everything was delicious!
МОНИКА: Thank you!
НЕДРУГ: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
МОНИКА: Thank you! You haven't said anything.
НЕДРУГ: Actually I do have one small complaint.
МОНИКА: Oh, please! II welcome criticism.
НЕДРУГ: The musician right outside the restaurant, it's kind of a mood-killer!
МОНИКА: What musician?
ФИБИ: And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
МОНИКА: What are you doing here!
ФИБИ: Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
МОНИКА: Great!
ФИБИ: Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, You suck and shut up and go home.
МОНИКА: Listen Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but.
ФИБИ: But what?
МОНИКА: This is kind of a classy place.
ФИБИ: Ok, say no more.
ФИБИ:: It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaage! Classy, uh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
НЕДРУГ: Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: New York.
РОСС: The big apple!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
РОСС: Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
НЕДРУГ: I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
РОСС: Check again please!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, it's not here.
РОСС: Not there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know what to say.
РОСС: She doesn't know what to say!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just give us the cheapest room you have.
НЕДРУГ: Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's insane!
РОСС: Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if, if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
НЕДРУГ: Great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What!? They are totally ripping us off!
РОСС: Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm. I take six!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
РОСС: C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude, you're shaking!
РОСС: I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and, and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
ДЖОУИ: Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh screw her, that part is mine!
ДЖОУИ: Right, ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you married him.
НЕДРУГ: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
НЕДРУГ: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
НЕДРУГ: It's over! You have to accept that.
НЕДРУГ: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that. I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kiss me.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kiss me.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I'm saying.
ДЖОУИ: but, but.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: just, don't talk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ehhh, aw! Well, that's new!
РОСС: Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave, and I feel like I am forgetting something. Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
РОСС: What did you get?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: USA Today.
РОСС: Nice, put it with the others.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I also got, two more apples.
РОСС: We are four short of a bush-o. God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
РОСС: Oh, that's not cool.
НЕДРУГ: Dude, none of this is cool.
РОСС: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think I know what you mean though, the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs, oh, you already got that.
РОСС: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, how about this?
РОСС: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but the batteries.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you, thank you very much!
РОСС: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
РОСС: At least tell me where you hid it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I ask you a question?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
МОНИКА: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, well this is like that, in no way. I had a. I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
МОНИКА: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
МОНИКА: What do you think brought than on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
МОНИКА: A love scene? With who?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Olivia.
МОНИКА: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So do you think that my dream means anything?
МОНИКА: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream.
МОНИКА: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You took the same class twice.
МОНИКА: It was hard!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ФИБИ: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
МОНИКА: Oh. Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
ФИБИ: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs. I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
ФИБИ: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work.
ФИБИ: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, we're still on that.
МОНИКА: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
ФИБИ: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
МОНИКА: Tiny portions?
ФИБИ: Yeah well, excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
ФИБИ: Well, it's not about quality.
МОНИКА: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
ФИБИ: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
МОНИКА: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
ФИБИ: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
МОНИКА: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
ФИБИ: What are people having, the garlic Martini?
НЕДРУГ: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
РОСС: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
РОСС: Oh my god.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РОСС: There's something new in the bowl.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we have enough, just walk away.
РОСС: No, but I want. I want the pinecones!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's a forest right outside.
РОСС: It's not the same.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, go quick!
РОСС: Thank you for a delightful stay.
РОСС: Oh, my maple candy!
ФИБИ: Food here at 'Javu', will kill you, the food here at 'Javu', will kill you.
МОНИКА: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
ФИБИ: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
МОНИКА: Ok, you have to stop playing now.
ФИБИ: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
МОНИКА: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
ФИБИ: Get your garlic-peelers off me!
МОНИКА: Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller. I'm the head chef here. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
ФИБИ: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
МОНИКА: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?.
ФИБИ: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
МОНИКА: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
ФИБИ: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?.
МОНИКА: Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
ФИБИ: Oh. Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry too.
МОНИКА: ooohh, hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
ФИБИ: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p.
ФИБИ: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! I thought I got it all!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How, how?
ДЖОУИ: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: uh-huh.
ДЖОУИ: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender, and I thought, well, how important can that be, right? Turns out very!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, definitely just Drake.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, how is it going with Drake?
ДЖОУИ: Oh. I don't think it's going very well.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, that scene I saw was so good!
ДЖОУИ: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
ДЖОУИ: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So?
ДЖОУИ: So. I've never played that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, well, just once, with you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, this could be a little awkward. I'm just going to blow past it, well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
ДЖОУИ: What the hell are you talking about?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, alright look, just uh, just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
ДЖОУИ: Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up, and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't. And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you never, you never talked about that before.
ДЖОУИ: Well, hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her, you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she, is, beautiful, and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks dude! This is GREAT!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got you something from Vermont!
МОНИКА: Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird, it's empty!
РОСС: Hi you guys! what's going on, you, you guys wanna hang out, or? do you, do you guys hear a buzzing?
