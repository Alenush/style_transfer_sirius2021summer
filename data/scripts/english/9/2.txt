РОСС: You said youd marry Joey?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! Im not helping.
РОСС: So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
РОСС: So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: WellReally? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
РОСС: Well, Chandlers my oldest friend, but Joeys myNo! Ah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooooo!
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys Im gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
РОСС: Rachel said shed marry you?!
ДЖОУИ: This isnt the right room, sorry folks.
МОНИКА: Ok, I dont wanna be negative so Ill say that most of the signs you bought are good.
ФИБИ: No they ran out of "Its a girl" but I can fix this one, See?
МОНИКА: So sexy. Honey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yea yea.
МОНИКА: Honey why dont you go lie down.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?
ДЖОУИ: Whyre you so tired?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Couldnt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldnt sleep.  Yknow? I was like, if I fall asleep now Ill get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now Ill get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldnt fall asleep.
ДЖОУИ: You know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi, welcome home!
МОНИКА: Phoebe did the signs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
ФИБИ: Look at all the stuff people sent!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ah! Oh my gosh theres something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think Oh you guys I love it.
ДЖОУИ: Hey so wheres Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hes downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
ДЖОУИ: Is he still mad at us?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you more then me, but he cant stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
ДЖОУИ: Thats not fair! I cant do that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Im not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
ДЖОУИ: See this is what I was afraid of, I didnt think I should be here either but somebody said hed be over it by now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
НЕДРУГ: The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
НЕДРУГ: Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you Ill go straight to my forty two point plan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Walter .
ФИБИ: Shes just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
МОНИКА: Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
РОСС: Okay I put most of the stuff away.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh great, the pacifiers?
РОСС: In the closet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The burping clogs?
РОСС: Linen closet.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The diapers?
РОСС: In the hospital.
ФИБИ: Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
РОСС: No I left the diapers at the hospital! Theres some in the bag but Ill run out and get some more.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
РОСС: Sure what kind?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
РОСС: Please take your time, its an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Blueberry.
РОСС: Blueberry it is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks.
МОНИКА: Wow, hes really not letting this go, is he?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God how long do you think thats gonna last?
ФИБИ: I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yknow I cant even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I cant believe how much I love her, I cant get enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.
ФИБИ: You know thats thats her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I think Im gonna wake her up.
ФИБИ: Oh no, Rach, no no, you know youre never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her! Come on little girl, hi!
ФИБИ: I can say I told you so but shes kinda doing that for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Im sorry mummys so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep
МОНИКА: Breaks your heart doesnt it
ФИБИ: It really does how long do you think we have to stay?
НЕДРУГ: Ok if everyones on board, its settled, Chandler, Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep.
НЕДРУГ: Are you on board?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa. Youre gonna love Oklahoma.
ФИБИ: Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
МОНИКА: Alright heres something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
МОНИКА: It worked!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it wont stop crying.
МОНИКА: Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Im not so sure.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
ФИБИ: Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
РОСС: Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
НЕДРУГ: Diapers huh?
РОСС: Yep.
НЕДРУГ: So I guess Rachel had you baby?
РОСС: Yep, can you believe it?
НЕДРУГ: Nope!  I still cant believe she slept with you in the first place.
РОСС: Huh? Ooh you mean like a Huh?
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Ross, I know youre pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
РОСС: Ah actually we dont.
ДЖОУИ: Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didnt even do anything wrong.
РОСС: What! You didnt do anything wrong?!
ДЖОУИ: I said I didnt technically.
РОСС: Okay lets put aside that you "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
ДЖОУИ: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I dont really know what that means. You were saying?
РОСС: And I can even understand that you couldnt tell Rachel, but why couldnt you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didnt.
ДЖОУИ: I know I shouldve. "Im sorry."
РОСС: Not using it right, Joe.
РОСС: Im gonna go.
ДЖОУИ: No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
РОСС: Give me the bag.
ДЖОУИ: No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry!
РОСС: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
РОСС: Im not gonna hit you.
ДЖОУИ: Why not?  Youll feel better!  Ill feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
РОСС: No I dont.
ДЖОУИ: A little bit.
РОСС: No.
ДЖОУИ: Little bit.
РОСС: No!
ДЖОУИ: A little bit more.
РОСС: Give me the bag.
ДЖОУИ: No, hit me
РОСС: Give me the bag.

ДЖОУИ: Hit me, hit me.
РОСС: No!
ДЖОУИ: Hit me! Hit me!
РОСС: You ducked!!
ДЖОУИ: Im sorry! It was a reflex!
РОСС: Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
ДЖОУИ: I couldnt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
РОСС: What is the matter with you?!?
ДЖОУИ: You were supposed to duck!!! Why didnt you duck?
РОСС: Why dont we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
ДЖОУИ: Good, good yeah, maybe while were there, they can check your reflexes. "Oops."
МОНИКА: Try feeding her again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I already fed her.
МОНИКА: I know, thats why I said again!
ФИБИ: Alright you guys, we cant turn on each other, Okay?  Thats just what she wants.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, you guys, just stay here, Im gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
ФИБИ: Oh Im kinda part of this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
ФИБИ: I knew I should have married Chandler.
МОНИКА: Okay whats up
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
МОНИКА: Oh yeah .
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
МОНИКА: What? Who says that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: People whove never ever been to Paris.
МОНИКА: Whats going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were moving to Tulsa!
МОНИКА: Excuse me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
МОНИКА: Tulsa, Oklahoma!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The Sooner State, whatever that is.
МОНИКА: Chandler, I dont even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
МОНИКА: Are you trying to tell me that were moving to Oklahoma, or that youre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. Ill get out of it.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is wrong with Emma?
МОНИКА: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm maam, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I dont think I can move to Tulsa.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really know what I was saying.
НЕДРУГ: You fell asleep?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, aint that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, heres the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me go there!
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, I
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! Thats a picture of your daughter, isnt it, well shes lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. Ill call you from Tulsa.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, so how is it?
РОСС: I broke my thumb.
ДЖОУИ: Your thumb? Thats weird. You sure youre punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
РОСС: You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
ДЖОУИ: You, you want me to help you with that?
РОСС: Why, does it look like Im having trouble with my misshapen claw?
ДЖОУИ: Name? I know Ross but whats it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
РОСС: Just Ross!
ДЖОУИ: Its pretty, Okay date of birth?
РОСС: You know my birthday.
ДЖОУИ: Sure, May...tember.
РОСС: October 18th.
ДЖОУИ: Occupation? Dinosaurs.
РОСС: Actually Im a palian Dinosaurs is fine the drawing is not.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
РОСС: Ah, Rachel I guess.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
РОСС: Just ah just put roommate.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, youre gonna get together right?
РОСС: I dont think that we are.
ДЖОУИ: But you two were supposed to be together.
РОСС: Well, I thought so too, but then she said shed marry you.
ДЖОУИ: Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
РОСС: Yeah thats what she said.
ДЖОУИ: So?
РОСС: So I dont wanna be just anybody.
ДЖОУИ: Wow.
РОСС: You know what, its, its better this way anyway. I mean I dont know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Its just much easier if were just friends who have a kid.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: And youre Okay with that?
РОСС: Yes. I mean, its what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  Thats why they call them plans.  Hello? Im fine.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, for what its worth, with Rachel I dont think youll ever be just "anybody."
РОСС: Hey there you go!
ДЖОУИ: "Thanks."
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
МОНИКА: About a week and a half.
ФИБИ: Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so Im just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!
МОНИКА: Rach, try holding her a different way.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys, Im doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
ФИБИ: Alright, Ill try, fine! Yes, Okay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here you go.
ФИБИ: Shh! Nothing works with this child!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I cant even comfort my own baby! Im the worst mother ever!
МОНИКА: Youre just new at this, itll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldnt have been easy but you figured that out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I dont think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
МОНИКА: Okay Ill take her, here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have to go to the bathroom.
ФИБИ: I have to go scream into a pillow.
МОНИКА: Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby.
ФИБИ: Have I gone deaf?
МОНИКА: It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
ФИБИ: You must be a fireball in bed.
МОНИКА: I cant believe it!  Shes asleep!  I got her to go to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!
ФИБИ: I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again! Im kidding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
МОНИКА: Yes I did, Im Monica, Super Aunt
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are the official baby crier stopper!
МОНИКА: Yes I am!!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Youre never leaving the apartment!

ФИБИ: Thankfully you dont need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel lets give it six to eight months .
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay so listen Im gonna go lay down.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
МОНИКА: Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh so there cant be any yelling.
МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Were moving to Tulsa
