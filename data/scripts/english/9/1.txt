РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So uhI guess we shouldmake it official huh?
ДЖОУИ: Uh Look Rach Hey Ross is here! Hey look! Its my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
РОСС: Hey Joey. Hey you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but Im really more of a candy guy.
РОСС: Youre weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
РОСС: Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
ДЖОУИ: No.
РОСС: What?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Im sorry. I meant no.
МОНИКА: Hi! Hey look whos here!
НЕДРУГ: Wheres my granddaughter? Ive been practicing my magic tricks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
РОСС: Hey, wheres uh, wheres mom?
НЕДРУГ: She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
МОНИКА: Oh, Aunt Liddys coming? That means we get five dollars each!
НЕДРУГ: So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Wow.
РОСС: Uh Dad, Emmas in the nursery. Ill take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I still need to talk to you.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
ФИБИ: Oh and I need to talk to you.
МОНИКА: About what?
ФИБИ: To see if know what these guys are talking about.
МОНИКА: Isnt she beautiful?
НЕДРУГ: Look at her, my first grandchild.
РОСС: What about Ben?
НЕДРУГ: Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow.
ФИБИ: Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
РОСС: Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
ФИБИ: Yay! Its so exciting! Wow, you couldve done that with us there.
РОСС: Yeah right.
ФИБИ: Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you cant talk to Rachel.
РОСС: What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
ФИБИ: Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure.
ДЖОУИ: Dude I just did something terrible.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
ДЖОУИ: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! Why does she think that?
ДЖОУИ: Because it kinda looked like I did.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again, what?!
ДЖОУИ: Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: As we all are at some point during the day.
ДЖОУИ: It wasnt my ring! It fell out of Rosss jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
ДЖОУИ: I guess.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
ДЖОУИ: I know! I know its awful.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what did she say?
ДЖОУИ: She said yes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does Ross know?
ДЖОУИ: Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I like that. Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
ДЖОУИ: Now lets not get carried away.
МОНИКА: I want a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
МОНИКА: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Im so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
МОНИКА: Deal!
РОСС: Dad seriously! Yknow you really should see someone about that!
НЕДРУГ: Noted.
РОСС: I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
НЕДРУГ: Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
РОСС: Actually umm.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ФИБИ: Are you all right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhh I think I just got engaged.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! He did it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
ФИБИ: Are you kidding? Im like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you really think this is a good idea?
ФИБИ: I just talked him into it, dont tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just dont know! It just doesnt feel right.
ФИБИ: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! Even Ross?
ФИБИ: Especially Ross!
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? IllIll come back later.
РОСС: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Ill guess justIll come back.
ФИБИ: There he goes, your fiancée.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I guess so.
ФИБИ: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cant say that Im surprised.
РОСС: Dad, what are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: I think there are people in there having sex.
ДЖОУИ: It cant be me, Im standing right here.
НЕДРУГ: Wanna peek?
РОСС: No!
НЕДРУГ: Come on!
РОСС: Yknow what? I dont like you without mom. Come on.
ДЖОУИ: Were not peeking?
НЕДРУГ: Well Im peeking. Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello sir, you know Monica.
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course! Oh Joey, this ring Iits beautiful I love it!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah uh look Rach, theres something I gotta tell ya.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wont take my breast?
НЕДРУГ: Its all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but dont worry. Itll happen.
ДЖОУИ: Yowsa!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
ДЖОУИ: Dear Lord.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry honey, what were you saying?
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh look, shes pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesnt she look scared?
ДЖОУИ: Yknow, I dont really know her.
НЕДРУГ: Why dont we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding me?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its just so frustrating! Why doesnt she want my breast?!
ДЖОУИ: I dont know! Maybe shes crazy!
ФИБИ: Oh hey! Wait up!
РОСС: Hi!
ФИБИ: Congratulations! I didnt want to say anything in front of Joey cause I didnt know if he knew yet.
РОСС: What, that we had a baby? Come on lets give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
ФИБИ: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: Oh, its a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havent done the secret thing in a long time.
РОСС: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnt propose.
ФИБИ: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
РОСС: I am a doctor! Yknow what? Im just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
ФИБИ: All right, me too. Should we wake her up?
РОСС: No! No, come on let her sleep! Shes so exhausted.
ФИБИ: And so engaged.
РОСС: What? Oh my God! She-she thinks were engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think were engaged?!
ФИБИ: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
РОСС: I didnt give her that ring!
ФИБИ: Really?
РОСС: No!
ФИБИ: So whose ring is it?
РОСС: Its mine.
ФИБИ: Is it an engagement ring?
РОСС: Yes!
ФИБИ: But you didnt give it to her?
РОСС: No!
ФИБИ: But you were going to propose?
РОСС: No!
ФИБИ: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
РОСС: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again.
ФИБИ: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
РОСС: Look, I didnt want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnt want to either. But I dont, I dont understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
ФИБИ: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
РОСС: Well I didnt! I didnt propose! Unless uh Did I? I havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something I would do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we cant stay in here forever.
МОНИКА: Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is okay. Were all adults here theres nothing to be ashamed of. Now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
МОНИКА: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
НЕДРУГ: Of course. Ill always be your dad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun.
МОНИКА: It wasnt fun?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? Why-why-would youWh-why Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I dont think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
МОНИКА: The truth is, Dad, were-were trying.
НЕДРУГ: What?
МОНИКА: Yeah, were trying to get pregnant.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! Ill guard the door!
МОНИКА: Well, thats okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
НЕДРУГ: Whoa-whoa-whoa! I dont think so! Arent you ovulating?
МОНИКА: Daddy?!
НЕДРУГ: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thats how I got my bad hip.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats funny, this conversations how I got the bullet hole in my head.
НЕДРУГ: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was.
МОНИКА: Daddy! I dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
НЕДРУГ: Youre right, youre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
МОНИКА: I dont feel good right now.
НЕДРУГ: But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. I need to tell you something.
МОНИКА: Well, nows a good time. Im on my way to have my ears cut off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey asked me marry him.
МОНИКА: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey proposed to me.
МОНИКА: Is he crazy?! You just had Rosss baby!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, II said yes.
МОНИКА: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rosss baby! Its-its so inappropriate. No, its worse than that. Its wrong. Its It is bigger than mine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
МОНИКА: You cant marry him!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why not? I dont want to do this alone! And hes such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
МОНИКА: Well do you love him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure.
МОНИКА: Sure?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I mean whatever.
МОНИКА: Honey, the question isdo you really want to marry Joey?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No, I dont. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You still havent told Rachel you werent really proposing?
ДЖОУИ: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look like?!
ДЖОУИ: I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
ДЖОУИ: Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I dont want to hurt her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, look, just do it gently.
ДЖОУИ: Youre right. Youre right. IIll go tell her now before Ross finds out and Ill be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
РОСС: Listen, I um I heard about the engagement.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Surprised?
РОСС: And confused. Rach, sweetie, II umI didnt propose to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
РОСС: I dont think you do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You didnt propose to me. Joey did.
РОСС: Poor baby, youre so tired. Rach, I didnt propose to you, Joey didnt propose to you, and Chandler didnt propose to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh You didnt propose to me, Chandler didnt propose to me, but Joey did.
РОСС: Joey proposed to you?
ДЖОУИ: I can come back.
РОСС: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
ДЖОУИ: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes you did!
ДЖОУИ: Actually, technically, I didnt.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then why did you give me a ring?
РОСС: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring?
ДЖОУИ: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you did!
ДЖОУИ: No, I didnt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you did!
ДЖОУИ: No, I didnt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you did! And dont you say, No, I didnt!
ДЖОУИ: Ahhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
РОСС: Whoa! You were down on one knee?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didntI didnt propose!
РОСС: Then what did happen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, what did happen?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but you said, Will you marry me?
ДЖОУИ: No, I didnt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you did!
ДЖОУИ: No, I didnt!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, you didOh my God you didnt! Well then why didnt you tell me that before?!
ДЖОУИ: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
РОСС: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
ДЖОУИ: Ill tell you about it later. Be cool.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
ДЖОУИ: It wasnt my ring! Its Rosss ring! Thats why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
РОСС: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were gonna propose to me?
РОСС: Uhh No.
ДЖОУИ: Well, this is awkward. See? I told you so.
РОСС: But II was going to see if yknow, maybe you uh, start dating again but thatI mean that-that was all, Rach.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, step up! I proposed.
РОСС: No, you didnt!
ДЖОУИ: Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, she just woke up! Shes hungry. Why dont we give this another try?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: I cant believe you told her I was going to propose!
ДЖОУИ: I cant believe youre not going to propose!
РОСС: Hey, Im not going to rush into anything!
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shes doing it Look, shes breast-feeding look!
ДЖОУИ: Ah, its beautiful.
НЕДРУГ: Ill come back for her later.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РОСС: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow, this feels weird.
РОСС: Good weird?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wonderful weird.
ДЖОУИ: Yknow what you guys? Im uh, Im gonna go too. And uh, Im sorry about everything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey dont worry, it was my mistake.
ДЖОУИ: No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just thatMan! That kid is going to town!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shes perfect.
РОСС: Were so lucky.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We really are.
РОСС: Look, II know its not a proposal and I dont know where you are, but with everything thats been going on and with Emma andIve been feeling.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I know. Ive feeling.
РОСС: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well, ummthen maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, maybe.
РОСС: Well good, okay. II, kind of think yknow if weif Youre wearing the ring.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh-whats that?
РОСС: And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry, what?
РОСС: When you thought Joey proposed diddid you say yes?
НЕДРУГ: Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
МОНИКА: Hey dad!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
