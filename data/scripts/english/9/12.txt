ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. So where's Mon? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: And you're not helping? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping. 
РОСС: Hey you guys! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Happy birthday ... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me. 
РОСС: Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
РОСС: Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy. 
ДЖОУИ: You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside. 
НЕДРУГ: No, you stay, I'll do it . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you guys . 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wow, Molly is just great! 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You really think she's hot? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: How do you think she's doing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? 
РОСС: Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I .... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now that Rachel's gone? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. 
ФИБИ: Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru? 
НЕДРУГ: Lima. 
ФИБИ: No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle. 
НЕДРУГ: You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". Oh god! Oh! 
ФИБИ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard. 
ФИБИ: Oh, whew, no, that's Bob. 
НЕДРУГ: What, is he your pet rat? 
ФИБИ: Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies. 
НЕДРУГ: You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus. 
ФИБИ: What are those? 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it! 
ФИБИ: OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
ФИБИ: So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology. 
НЕДРУГ: For what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ... 
НЕДРУГ: Is this your first appology? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you. 
НЕДРУГ: Good morning! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out! 
НЕДРУГ: I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep. 
НЕДРУГ: Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate. 
НЕДРУГ: I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship. 
НЕДРУГ: Huh. What's Tag's last name? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses. 
НЕДРУГ: But it was a deap meaningful relationship. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh! 
НЕДРУГ: It was Jones. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? 
ДЖОУИ: Man, I wish I had a nanny like you. 
НЕДРУГ: You mean, when you were a baby. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure. 
МОНИКА: Would you stop staring at her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wasn't staring. I was leering. 
МОНИКА: What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way. 
РОСС: Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her. 
МОНИКА: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna take her back to the appartment. 
РОСС: Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ... 
НЕДРУГ: Bye 
МОНИКА: They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good. 
НЕДРУГ: I think it's sweet. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her. 
ДЖОУИ: Why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away. 
ДЖОУИ: So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right. 
РОСС: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more! 
РОСС: What are you, a child? 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! 
РОСС: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else. 
ДЖОУИ: Fine. 
МОНИКА: Take me home! 
ФИБИ: Hey Mikey 
НЕДРУГ: Hey P 
ФИБИ: What are you doing? 
НЕДРУГ: Setting rat traps. 
ФИБИ: To kill Bob?? 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, to test his neck strength. 
ФИБИ: No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps. 
ФИБИ: I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom! 
НЕДРУГ: Better think of a new name for him. 
ФИБИ: I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl. 
НЕДРУГ: I don't know, I mean I'm not sure ... 
ФИБИ: Oh my god, we killed Bob! 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse. 
ФИБИ: Suzie? 
РОСС: Whazzup?? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously dude, 3 years ago. 
РОСС: Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't trust him? 
РОСС: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny". 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now. 
РОСС: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. 
РОСС: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Picturing that tree? 
РОСС: I am, yes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where you going, Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: For a walk. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. You mind if I join you? 
ДЖОУИ: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your thoughts? Plural? 
ДЖОУИ: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go. 
ДЖОУИ: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great novels? 
ДЖОУИ: Fine ... mediocre porn 
НЕДРУГ: Gavin Mitchelle's office. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you. 
НЕДРУГ: Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. Yes? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror? 
НЕДРУГ: Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. Man, I really bug you, don't I? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now. 
МОНИКА: Hey Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Ready for your birthday lunch? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle. 
НЕДРУГ: Pleased to meet you. 
МОНИКА: Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother. 
НЕДРУГ: Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy! 
МОНИКА: You were just being so nice to him! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit! 
МОНИКА: Right there! That was so fake! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see. 
МОНИКА: Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me. 
МОНИКА: Does he? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over. 
НЕДРУГ: She's out, I'm gonna take her home. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her? 
МОНИКА: Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later 
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, give me! 
ФИБИ: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. We have rat babies now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party? 
МОНИКА: So this is what a stroke feels like. 
ФИБИ: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat? 
ФИБИ: No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats? 
ФИБИ: Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. 
РОСС: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, I got a little occupied. 
РОСС: We have to stop them before something happens! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right behind you, big guy! 
ДЖОУИ: So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work. 
НЕДРУГ: So where did you study? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I didn't go to college. 
НЕДРУГ: No, where did you study acting? 
ДЖОУИ: Molly ... people don't study acting ... 
РОСС: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure, I'll go check on Emma. 
РОСС: Thanx. 
ДЖОУИ: Will the stable boy never get the princess?? 
РОСС: What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch? 
ДЖОУИ: No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again. 
НЕДРУГ: Come on! Joe! 
ДЖОУИ: Ok 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, is Molly here? 
РОСС: Yeah, come on in. Molly? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha . I'll see you tomorrow. 
РОСС: Ok ... Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem. 
ДЖОУИ: It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! 
ФИБИ: Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats? 
ФИБИ: Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them? 
ФИБИ: Mate? They're all brothers and sisters. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals. 
ФИБИ: No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites. 
НЕДРУГ: It's gonna be ok. 
ФИБИ: You must think I'm crazy. 
НЕДРУГ: No, I think you're sweet. 
ФИБИ: Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I? 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up? 
МОНИКА: No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over. 
МОНИКА: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mmm hmm. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, hey. 
МОНИКА: Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice party. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ... 
МОНИКА: Again, you're welcome. 
НЕДРУГ: Look, I'll just give you this and go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you bought me a present! Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin" 
НЕДРУГ: I really mean it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awww, awww, it's beautiful. 
НЕДРУГ: You don't mind? Well, what do you know, it fits! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me. 
НЕДРУГ: I do have feelings for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You do? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...
