НЕДРУГ: Oh! That feels sooo good! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show! 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma. 
НЕДРУГ: From... Cosmo?? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin". 
НЕДРУГ: So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes! 
ДЖОУИ: So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah... 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you could take Charlie shopping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well... 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sure you have better things to do. 
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes. 
НЕДРУГ: If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!! 
ДЖОУИ: Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY! 
ФИБИ: Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right? 
ДЖОУИ: What's the matter, Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him! 
ФИБИ: Exactly! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous! 
ФИБИ: I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something. 
ФИБИ: Ok, that'll be great! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's not what we're gonna do! 
ДЖОУИ: Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face! 
МОНИКА: Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options. 
МОНИКА: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, DAMN IT! 
МОНИКА: Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor. 
МОНИКА: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah! Let's do it! 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, have a good time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not gonna find any clothes in there! 
РОСС: Hey, you guys! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
РОСС: Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference? 
НЕДРУГ: Umh... Kurts Baley? 
РОСС: Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing? 
ДЖОУИ: Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions? 
РОСС: Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today. 
НЕДРУГ: He's a pretty tough guy to impress. 
РОСС: Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya? 
РОСС: Tsz... NO! . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey guys! 
РОСС: Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick. 
РОСС: It's in Barbados. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you come first! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm there! 
НЕДРУГ: We'll see you, guys! 
ДЖОУИ: Bye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye, see ya. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample. 
РОСС: So-so what did the doctor say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her. 
ДЖОУИ: So you're ruling out surrogacy? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: So, I don't have to learn what that means? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors. 
ДЖОУИ: Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ah-ha! 
РОСС: How do you feel about all this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it! 
РОСС: What? 
РОСС: What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben! 
РОСС: The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering. 
НЕДРУГ: Mmm-mm. 
РОСС: I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles! 
РОСС: Oh, that's not what you want... 
НЕДРУГ: Incentive For Men? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'll take some of that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, that's for men! 
ФИБИ: No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets! 
НЕДРУГ: So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here. 
НЕДРУГ: See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them. 
НЕДРУГ: You've seen all the movies... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies! 
ФИБИ: Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure! 
ФИБИ: Ok! 
НЕДРУГ: Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff. 
ФИБИ: So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her! 
ФИБИ: Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance! 
ФИБИ: Who else? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom... 
ФИБИ: You like Joey? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous! 
ФИБИ: Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I get it! 
ФИБИ: Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So can we keep this between us? 
ФИБИ: Sure! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me! 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
ФИБИ: Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin? 
МОНИКА: Hi honey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work! 
МОНИКА: Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack! 
НЕДРУГ: You too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer. 
МОНИКА: I got it. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, Zack's pretty nice, uh? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I guess. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his! 
МОНИКА: Excuse me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out. 
МОНИКА: Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go! 
МОНИКА: I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok! 
МОНИКА: Uh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Zack! 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring. 
МОНИКА: Tell me about yourself, Zack! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard! 
ФИБИ: Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying! 
ФИБИ: I didn't say anything yet! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, get back in there and talk! 
ФИБИ: I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What!? 
ФИБИ: Well, some things are just hard to say to your face. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too! 
ФИБИ: Ooh! We have a problem. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! What are we gonna do? 
НЕДРУГ: Just be honest with her. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright! Enough out of you! 
ДЖОУИ: Hello? 
РОСС: Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there? 
ДЖОУИ: No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up? 
РОСС: I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker... 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! How's it going? 
РОСС: It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep! 
ДЖОУИ: What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda! 
РОСС: Barbados. 
ДЖОУИ: Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job! 
РОСС: What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, just wake him up! 
РОСС: I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!? 
МОНИКА: Hey guys! Dinner's ready! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. Thanks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones! 
МОНИКА: Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't like him. 
МОНИКА: I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright! Just follow my lead! 
НЕДРУГ: You guys have such a great place here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family? 
НЕДРУГ: Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Ducokus. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack. 
НЕДРУГ: Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet. 
МОНИКА: Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes? 
НЕДРУГ: No... 
МОНИКА: Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout? 
НЕДРУГ: You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh? 
МОНИКА: We're just making conversation. 
НЕДРУГ: Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness 
НЕДРУГ: Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! Alright... 
НЕДРУГ: Ravioli's delicious! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child? 
НЕДРУГ: No I didn't. 
МОНИКА: Yess!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're teeth people Zack! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard. 
ФИБИ: Good plan. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going? 
ФИБИ: Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! trying on clothes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel... I heard you guys whispering. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain. 
НЕДРУГ: No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah... 
НЕДРУГ: You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I try... 
РОСС: Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! 
НЕДРУГ: You're welcome. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness! 
ФИБИ: Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party. 
ДЖОУИ: Then don't go! 
ФИБИ: Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture. 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk! 
ФИБИ: You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room. 
ФИБИ: David? 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe! Hi! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, you look unbelievable. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. What-what are you doing here? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently. 
ФИБИ: What happened? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles? 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done. 
ФИБИ: Well, it's great that you're back! How are you? 
НЕДРУГ: Good, good, life is good... 
ФИБИ: Good! 
НЕДРУГ: Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone. 
ФИБИ: Oh, good for you. 
НЕДРУГ: She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that". 
ФИБИ: Mike and I broke up. 
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up. 
ФИБИ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face. 
ФИБИ: I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now? 
ФИБИ: Well... no. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you wanna get a drink? 
ФИБИ: I'd love to. 
НЕДРУГ: Great. 
ФИБИ: Ok. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you smell beets? 
ФИБИ: Oh, got it, stay upwind of me. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, that's David. 
НЕДРУГ: There's a third guy? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tip of the iceberg. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer? 
НЕДРУГ: No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression. 
НЕДРУГ: No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think we've found our sperm! 
МОНИКА: Does seem pretty perfect. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway! 
МОНИКА: No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he's better! 
МОНИКА: No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Are you sure? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'm sure. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm. 
МОНИКА: That is so sweet. I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you know this leaves us with... 
МОНИКА: Adoption. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you feel about that? 
МОНИКА: I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way. 
МОНИКА: So this is it, we're really gonna adopt? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, we're gonna be parents! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are gonna be great parents. 
МОНИКА: And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Zack! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable. 
НЕДРУГ: No you didn't. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: No you did. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it. 
НЕДРУГ: for Friday's pitch . 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
