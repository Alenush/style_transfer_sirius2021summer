ДЖОУИ: Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, let me see. II believe I'm, yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
ДЖОУИ: Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I could fall asleep at a play.
ФИБИ: What is it?
ДЖОУИ: It's a one-woman play called Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life.
МОНИКА: It sounds interesting!
РОСС: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett.
ФИБИ: I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
ДЖОУИ: You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
РОСС: What? How come that you don't have to go!
ДЖОУИ: I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, sorry. Oops, sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, here you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, oooh, oh, ah. Can I ask you a question?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and, and not have it be a big deal?
МОНИКА: No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No reason.
МОНИКА: No, no, Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Who do you wanna fool around with?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nobody, forget it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe.
МОНИКА: You can't!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
МОНИКА: In the hall.
МОНИКА: You wanna fool around with Joey?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
МОНИКА: Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, off the top of my head. Don and Janet.
МОНИКА: Who, who are they?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know them from work.
МОНИКА: Both of them?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, one of them.
МОНИКА: Which one?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, what were the names I just said?
МОНИКА: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?
МОНИКА: What the hell are you cooking!
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
РОСС: There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
МОНИКА: What's so bad about that?
РОСС: It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
МОНИКА:: Ross?
РОСС: These aren't suede.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
НЕДРУГ: No.
РОСС: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
РОСС: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
НЕДРУГ: It's a. It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
РОСС: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
МОНИКА: Is he gonna introduce us?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
НЕДРУГ: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
РОСС: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
МОНИКА: Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
РОСС: We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
РОСС: I don't think so.
НЕДРУГ: I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
РОСС: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is if you can't come on time, then don't come at all. An option that many of my students use. Shall we?
НЕДРУГ: You don't think we should wait for him?
РОСС: You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
НЕДРУГ: Professor Geller?
РОСС: Oh, damn it!
НЕДРУГ: Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: What's happenin'?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight.
ДЖОУИ: Stupid Jane Rogers!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are having a party tonight?
ДЖОУИ: Kinda have a, a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
ДЖОУИ: I do it every year.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You do that every year?
ДЖОУИ: I didn't have to tell you that! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe you guys went for that one!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
ДЖОУИ: You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then so you just invite me.!
ДЖОУИ: Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH, a soap opera roof party! I'm going to a soap opera roof party! Oh my God, oh my God! And it's out of my system!
НЕДРУГ: And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
РОСС: So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
НЕДРУГ: And that's not all I'm allergic to.
РОСС: Oh, it's not over!
НЕДРУГ: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts.
РОСС: So basically all nuts?
НЕДРУГ: Interestingly, no.
НЕДРУГ: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word interesting.
НЕДРУГ: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
РОСС: I've lost the will to live.
НЕДРУГ: Let's ditch him!
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
РОСС: Oh, ok, fine. But, ehm. I just have one question for you, ehm. When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll.
НЕДРУГ: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!
РОСС: Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
ФИБИ: Hi!
РОСС: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
ФИБИ: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas.
ФИБИ: Ah, ah.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me.
РОСС: Ranion's theory of species variegation?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
МОНИКА: So, did you two have fun?
РОСС: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny.
МОНИКА: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY! HI!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
РОСС: Really? Wh-what's wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know. I was watching this thing on TV this morning about. Newcastle disease, and I think I might have it!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and, other poultry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, who is this?
РОСС: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but. I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
МОНИКА: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure! Oh.
МОНИКА: You're not sick!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Yes, I am!
МОНИКА: Ok, then, why are you, all dressed up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
МОНИКА: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
МОНИКА: Ok, what is this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
МОНИКА: WHAT?
РОСС: Wh-what's going on?
МОНИКА: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!
НЕДРУГ: I thought you came to say you were sick.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok professor or detective?
ФИБИ: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
ФИБИ: And that horrible museum tour!
РОСС: No, I arranged that.
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
ФИБИ: We know about your party Joey.
ДЖОУИ: What party?
МОНИКА: The game's over! Take off your robe!
ДЖОУИ: Ok. I mean.
НЕДРУГ: No! Cover it up!
ДЖОУИ: Nice to meet ya!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
МОНИКА: I love you!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright, go, go get yourself a drink or something.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
ФИБИ: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where the hell is everybody?
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
МОНИКА: Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this best wishes crap. I want love.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
МОНИКА: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
НЕДРУГ: It was nice to meet you Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nice to meet you.
НЕДРУГ: Call me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
МОНИКА: We will!
МОНИКА: Look at you with all the guys!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
МОНИКА: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
МОНИКА: Please. Chandler is the love of my life, oooh leather pants! Have Mercy!
РОСС: So, eh, it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving. I just broke up with someeone.
РОСС: Ooh, so sad. Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
НЕДРУГ: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
РОСС: You, you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like, like calling Albert Einstein, er. Alby.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
РОСС: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
НЕДРУГ: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues.
РОСС: Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry, it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
РОСС: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
НЕДРУГ: A guy who won two.
РОСС: Two? Wha? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, for three years.
РОСС: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
НЕДРУГ:, no, bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
РОСС: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
НЕДРУГ: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
РОСС: Huh, huh, what a loser! Some more wine?
ФИБИ: Hey Ross!
НЕДРУГ: How is it going with Charlie?
РОСС: Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my, eh. average-sized brains out.
ФИБИ: Oh, What's the matter?
РОСС: She, she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I always loved that!
РОСС: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
ФИБИ: Worse?
РОСС: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians. Can we walk? Oh, you, you like that?
ФИБИ: No.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on! I think this is funny!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' Now would be a really great time for an intermission, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: oh yes, God yes!
НЕДРУГ: Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. How could he leave me?!?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I. I don't know, you seem lovely.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
РОСС: Nice to meet you.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! So what show are you on?
РОСС: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
ДЖОУИ: It's a science.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on Days. And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or.
РОСС: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
РОСС: I'd lead with that.
МОНИКА: That's it, just sign right on the bra.
ДЖОУИ: Monica!
МОНИКА: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
ДЖОУИ: What have you got there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think I am.
ДЖОУИ: Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug. This guy's Canadian. And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000 to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
ДЖОУИ: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you're so sweet.
ДЖОУИ: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who?
ДЖОУИ: Me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Really?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
ДЖОУИ: Gotcha.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Very funny. Joey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, how did you enjoy the play?
МОНИКА: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
МОНИКА: You really liked it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: fat, single and ready to mingle, I was uplifted.
МОНИКА: Oh really!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
МОНИКА: No!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did somebody sign your bra?
МОНИКА: So I got it when I was 13.
ФИБИ: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
РОСС: It's actually a 1,000,000 prize.
ФИБИ: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe PhD.
РОСС: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
ФИБИ: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny.
РОСС: And sexy.
ФИБИ: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
РОСС: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
ФИБИ: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
РОСС: Stop going through my stuff!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
МОНИКА: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Please, what about you and Chandler?
МОНИКА: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well hello!
МОНИКА: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
МОНИКА: Alright. I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm gonna do it.
МОНИКА: And I can't stop you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
РОСС: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
РОСС: I'm smarter than him!
ФИБИ: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
МОНИКА: Oh, you're so wonderful.
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death.
