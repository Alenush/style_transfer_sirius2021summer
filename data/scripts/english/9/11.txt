НЕДРУГ: Peter Tibbals Story by: Judd Rubin Directed by: Gary Halvorson 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life. 
МОНИКА: Well, I just lost my erection. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself? 
МОНИКА: You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start. 
МОНИКА: Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off! 
МОНИКА: I know!!! My erection is back! 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you! 
ФИБИ: Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ:: Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian? 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash. 
ДЖОУИ: If you want I could loan you some money? 
ФИБИ: Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show? 
ФИБИ: You could do that? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. 
ФИБИ: Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think. 
ФИБИ: Oh, really? 
ДЖОУИ: No it is awesome! 
РОСС: Hi guys. 
НЕДРУГ: 
ФИБИ: Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up? 
РОСС: Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute? 
ДЖОУИ: She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! 
РОСС: I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow? 
МОНИКА: Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How long was I in there? 
МОНИКА: Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea! 
МОНИКА: Don't you want to look through the rest? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though. 
МОНИКА: You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?" 
МОНИКА: I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey? Leave it to the pros. 
МОНИКА: I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: "The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones." 
МОНИКА: "Marriage. It's not for everybody." 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. 
РОСС: Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!? 
НЕДРУГ: Who the hell are you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm the hell person whose office this is! 
РОСС: Good one, Rach. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy? 
ФИБИ: Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, okay! You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle. 
ФИБИ: Okay, now. What? 
НЕДРУГ: And...Action!! 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! Cut! 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, don't be. 
ФИБИ: Okay, that helps. 
НЕДРУГ: And...Action! 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight. 
НЕДРУГ: And...Action! 
НЕДРУГ: So, do you have any other question about advertising? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood." 
НЕДРУГ: Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? That's great! 
НЕДРУГ: It's an unpaid internship. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid." 
НЕДРУГ: Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now. 
НЕДРУГ: Stop! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw. 
НЕДРУГ: Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. 
НЕДРУГ: I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me? 
РОСС: Rach we have a code brown situation. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can you please, please take care of it for me? 
РОСС: Alright, but you have to do one sometime. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue? 
НЕДРУГ: Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi Mr. Zelner. 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power. 
НЕДРУГ: Incidentally, when are you coming back? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Today. 
НЕДРУГ: You said two weeks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey. So, what did he say? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass." 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor. 
ДЖОУИ: That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray. 
ФИБИ: Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die! 
ФИБИ: Who dies? 
ДЖОУИ: Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job. 
ФИБИ: Yes, doctor. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, let's try this one more time. 
ФИБИ: Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming! 
НЕДРУГ: And...Action! 
ФИБИ: Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next? 
НЕДРУГ: The rest of the scene. 
ФИБИ: Okay, from the top, people! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me. 
РОСС: What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. 
РОСС: What about Emma? We don't have a nanny. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today? 
РОСС: Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, I don't know what else to do. 
РОСС: Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross? 
РОСС: Huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're pretty. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family. 
РОСС: So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
РОСС: Good-bye. 
МОНИКА: Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Ross is here so... 
РОСС: Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing? 
МОНИКА: We're gonna have sex. 
РОСС: I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something. 
МОНИКА: Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not. 
РОСС: Pants off Bing! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, they were popular when I left! 
НЕДРУГ: Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed? 
НЕДРУГ: That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up! 
НЕДРУГ: Fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in! 
РОСС: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits. 
МОНИКА: Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees. 
РОСС: Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan! 
МОНИКА: Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant. 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it. 
МОНИКА: What!? You faked it? 
РОСС: You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual 
ФИБИ: Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay. 
ФИБИ: Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress. 
ФИБИ: Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children. 
ДЖОУИ: Nice. 
ФИБИ: Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him? 
ДЖОУИ: No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight. 
ФИБИ: About what? 
ДЖОУИ: He slept with you and then never called you. 
ФИБИ: And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action! 
НЕДРУГ: So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm surprised to, but yet here I am. 
НЕДРУГ: Cut, cut! What are you doing!? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back. 
НЕДРУГ: Me too! 
НЕДРУГ: Me too! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow, you're here already. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything! 
НЕДРУГ: How do you fix the chair? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon. 
НЕДРУГ: Good, because it's in ten minutes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him! 
НЕДРУГ: You can do the presentation. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I can't, I have a baby. 
НЕДРУГ: I'll watch her. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why would you do that? 
НЕДРУГ: Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's really nice. 
НЕДРУГ: I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you. 
ДЖОУИ: Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay. But this is her last chance. 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables? 
ФИБИ: I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process. 
ДЖОУИ: You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it. 
ФИБИ: Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened. 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy. 
МОНИКА: You faked it? You couldn't have faked it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises. 
МОНИКА: Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while. 
МОНИКА: Like a month? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or a year? 
МОНИКА: Really, you want to wait a year? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year. 
МОНИКА: I really wanna have a baby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back. 
МОНИКА: No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I quit and you learn what I do? 
МОНИКА: It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby. 
МОНИКА: It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind? 
МОНИКА: Yes, please! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time. 
МОНИКА: I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up! 
НЕДРУГ: I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother. 
НЕДРУГ: I'm not your brother. 
НЕДРУГ: What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
