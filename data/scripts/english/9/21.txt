НЕДРУГ: Robert Carlock Story: Scott Silveri Directed by: Gary Halvorson Transcribed by: Eleonora, Pheeboh, Sebastiano amp Vanessa.
МОНИКА: It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
РОСС: Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
РОСС: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
РОСС: Why do you care so much?
МОНИКА: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know, and I, want him to hook up with lots of women! I just. All I'm saying is. I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
РОСС: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils.
ФИБИ: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism. Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, so. Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean.
РОСС: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it.
РОСС: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: I'm gonna get some more coffee.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
РОСС: Ok.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, a professor, uh?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious. That's not how she used it?
НЕДРУГ: I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm, well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
РОСС: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them, those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
НЕДРУГ: You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral.
РОСС: Yeah, I know the type.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
ФИБИ: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
ФИБИ: Oh, then I overpaid.
МОНИКА: Hey, what's this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
МОНИКА: Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting.
МОНИКА: Do you wanna go hunting?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I would like to have the option!
ФИБИ: What's up? Hey, Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ФИБИ: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these big massage places! They're putting people like me out of business!
МОНИКА: And she wants to go hunting, too!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
ФИБИ: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about, it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us, the hollow shells.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't care about any of that!
ФИБИ: Well, do you care about friendship?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ФИБИ: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe! Fine, I won't use it!
ФИБИ: Promise?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I promise.
ФИБИ: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I am going hunting!
МОНИКА: Hey honey! I missed you today!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah?
МОНИКА: Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well. Maybe we could.
МОНИКА: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We really need to take those tests?
МОНИКА: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
МОНИКА: What is the big deal?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's weird! In a doctor's office?
МОНИКА: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
МОНИКА: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
МОНИКА: OH!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
ДЖОУИ: Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
ДЖОУИ: Heeey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Come on in, how are ya?
НЕДРУГ: I'm good!
ДЖОУИ: Can I offer you a drink?
НЕДРУГ: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book.
ДЖОУИ: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!
НЕДРУГ: So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if you need a tour guide.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
ДЖОУИ: Ok!
НЕДРУГ: And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
ДЖОУИ: I know, yeah!
НЕДРУГ: And first, I have to see the MET!
ДЖОУИ: Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
ДЖОУИ: Which one, they all suck!
НЕДРУГ: The museum!
ДЖОУИ: I don't think so.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi there!
НЕДРУГ: Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
НЕДРУГ: This has been torn up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And, taped back together.
НЕДРУГ: Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: Have a seat through the glass doors.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: through the glass doors.
НЕДРУГ: Through the glass doors.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright-y then.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
ФИБИ: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, everyone is booked!
ФИБИ: But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
НЕДРУГ: Then why you work here?
ФИБИ: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I think this is a great place to work!
ФИБИ: Ok, are they listening?
ДЖОУИ: Ross!
РОСС: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: I need to talk to you about Charlie.
РОСС: Oh, do you, do you really?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I'm. I'm kind of having a little problem.
РОСС: Look, if you don't know what the word acrimonious means, just don't use it!
ДЖОУИ: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo.
РОСС: Get to the problem!
ДЖОУИ: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
РОСС: Are you wearing two belts?
ДЖОУИ: EH, what do you know!
РОСС: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
ДЖОУИ: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
РОСС: You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
ДЖОУИ: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
РОСС: Fine.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks.
РОСС: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
ДЖОУИ: The Metsss!
РОСС: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
РОСС: Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
ДЖОУИ: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
РОСС: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
ДЖОУИ: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
РОСС: But I'm not! You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
РОСС: Ok.
ДЖОУИ: You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
РОСС: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
МОНИКА: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
НЕДРУГ: Mr. Bing? Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
МОНИКА: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I guess!
МОНИКА: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
НЕДРУГ: OH MY GOD!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, Come on!
НЕДРУГ: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
МОНИКА: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why are you here?
НЕДРУГ: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no no. I mean, why? why is she here?
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What!?
МОНИКА: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd love to stay, but I have eh, got a hot date.
НЕДРУГ: Please, go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it just fell off.
ФИБИ: Hello ja, it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
ФИБИ: Okay, then I'm Swedish.
МОНИКА: So, what's your name?
ФИБИ: It's a normal Swedish name. Ikea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what an interesting name.
ФИБИ: Ja!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know I.
ФИБИ: Time for your scalp massage!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. I really love your.
ФИБИ: Is something wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's just that uhm, it feels so good. Ikea. Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
ФИБИ: Uhm. Stockholm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
ДЖОУИ: Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
РОСС: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
РОСС: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt MONAY. I just. I wrote that out phonetically for you.
ДЖОУИ: Phonetically?
РОСС: Yeah, yeah that means, you know? We just, we don't have time for this.
ДЖОУИ: Ok.
РОСС: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
ДЖОУИ: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on Days I had to say Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.
РОСС: Wow. What does that mean?
ДЖОУИ: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means you're gonna get eaten by a bear.
РОСС: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
ДЖОУИ: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy!
РОСС: Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
ДЖОУИ: Come on! you.
РОСС: No!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not, gone?
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! yeah. The hard part is over!
НЕДРУГ: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I haven't. I haven't even thought about the results yet. I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to, come here and do. 'that'.
НЕДРУГ: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was a Wendy's!
ФИБИ: Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, Ikea, what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
ФИБИ: Oh, Ja! Ja!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yah! She's, uhm, not very good though.
ФИБИ: Uhu, uhu, and why do you think that is?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar.
ФИБИ: Or, maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: You know it's me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
ФИБИ: How can you come here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How could you not tell me you worked here?
ФИБИ: I don't have to tell you everything!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
ФИБИ: Tips not included.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
ФИБИ: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know, you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
ФИБИ: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good for you Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Ok.
ФИБИ: Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
РОСС: Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
РОСС: Respectfully, professor R. Geller. Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey, how was the Met?
НЕДРУГ: The museum was amazing!
РОСС: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
РОСС: What do you mean?
НЕДРУГ: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
РОСС: Wait a minute, when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
НЕДРУГ: No, we went to the left.
РОСС: Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it's fun.
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well it would be weird.
РОСС: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
НЕДРУГ: Well. I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone. I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
РОСС: Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I guess that's true.
РОСС: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
НЕДРУГ: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
РОСС: That was going to be my next argument.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: You're ready?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
РОСС: Glad I could help man.
ДЖОУИ: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but. I made it work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
МОНИКА: Hey sweetie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Doctor Connelly just called.
МОНИКА: With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said Doctor Connelly just called. If it was good news you would have said Doctor Connelly just called! But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually it's both of us.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
МОНИКА: Oh, what does that mean?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means.
МОНИКА: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry.
МОНИКА: I'm sorry too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we're gonna, we're gonna figure this out.
МОНИКА: I know.
НЕДРУГ: Good morning Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Good morning receptionist.
НЕДРУГ: Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.
ФИБИ: Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?
ФИБИ: Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
