НЕДРУГ: This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler Bing.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's up Joe?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the WizzardsKnicks game, courtside!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Courtside? Oh my God.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
МОНИКА: Hello?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
МОНИКА: Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. That's not the way to convince you.
МОНИКА: Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me. So, if you could just realize it on your own.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.
МОНИКА: Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, ah, ah. I'll think of something.
РОСС: Wow! Wow, You look, uh. It's just, ah. That dress, uh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
РОСС: Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.
РОСС: Oh right, right. So, are you, ah, you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
РОСС: Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe's Mike?
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn't know you guys hung out.
РОСС: We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
РОСС: I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced I have some experience in that area.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross.
РОСС: Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: So. Welcome.
НЕДРУГ: I got beer.
РОСС: I got bottled breast milk.
НЕДРУГ: Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
РОСС: Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.
НЕДРУГ: Ah? Do you have one here?
РОСС: No.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: Um, ah, you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah. Phoebe said you. You've been divorced?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't. I don't really like to talk about it.
РОСС: That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
НЕДРУГ: So, you're a paleontologist, right?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: My cousin's a paleontologist.
РОСС: Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is wearing a sexy negligee. She pours two glasses of wine as Chandler enters with a carry-on suitcase. He sets the case by the door.
МОНИКА: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Welcome home.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well, look at you.
МОНИКА: Yeah. What do you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it looks great. It's just that, well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath. So.
МОНИКА: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See what I mean.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! How come the door's locked?
МОНИКА: Just a second.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no, no, no. Joey can't know that I'm here.
МОНИКА: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game. So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
МОНИКА: So, you lied to him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Achhh. It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. Except with you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Open the door. What's going on?
ДЖОУИ: What are you. Why are you dressed like that?
МОНИКА: Oh, because, um, well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days. So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
МОНИКА: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation. You know, like, Hi, How do I look? Really sexy. Could I BE any more turned on?
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out?
МОНИКА: Because, one of them is for you.
МОНИКА: Cheers. Okay, buh-bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it's funny. I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself. Hi ya.
МОНИКА: You might want to keep practicing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's Joey. Hey Joe.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, come home!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Why?
ДЖОУИ: COME. HOME.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look I, I can't. What's going on?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh. I think Monica's cheatin' on ya. I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
ДЖОУИ: All right look. If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: NO!
ДЖОУИ: I just heard him!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you, hear him, now?
ДЖОУИ: No. All right, I'm going in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Wait!
ДЖОУИ: I heard him again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, look. Just stay there. I'm coming home.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Great. I'll see you when you get here. I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that really necessary?
ДЖОУИ: Absolutely. You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
НЕДРУГ: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle. Ross stares off to the side.
РОСС: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?
НЕДРУГ: Eleven minutes. And now twelve. So, do you like the beer?
РОСС: I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager.
НЕДРУГ: huh. What's the difference between beer and lager?
РОСС: I don't know. We could look it up.
НЕДРУГ: Things are about to get wild.
ФИБИ: Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
ФИБИ: I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, um. I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a, ah, little thing.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little, um, eye-contact.
ФИБИ: Eye-contact?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mm-hmm.
ФИБИ: I hope you were using protection.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me. Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Should we send them something back?
ФИБИ: Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.
ФИБИ: So? What if they do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b, baby and a Ross.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as eye-contact.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.
МОНИКА: I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
МОНИКА: Yes, because all good plans start with, I'll go down the fire escape.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
МОНИКА: Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm just going to wait for a little while.
МОНИКА: Scary pigeon's back?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's huge.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.
НЕДРУГ: Spuds is your grandmother?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's my bubby!
НЕДРУГ: So, we're on our way to a couple of parties. Um, maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
ФИБИ: Yeah. I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.
НЕДРУГ: All right. It's no big deal.
НЕДРУГ: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um.
НЕДРУГ: Then, can I have your number?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, no.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh sure.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ФИБИ: Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.
ФИБИ: What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Me too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Me neither.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. That works for me.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thanks.
ФИБИ: But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wha, hey!
ФИБИ: Better!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just, move on with my life.
ФИБИ: Really? You're moving on from Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
ФИБИ: Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.
ФИБИ: Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone. Dead on.
НЕДРУГ: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Mike are sitting on the sofa. Ross is fidgeting with the cuff of his sweater while Mike blows his cheeks out. Ross blows a piece of fuzz from his finger.
НЕДРУГ: Ya know, I'm going to take off.
РОСС: So soon?
НЕДРУГ: Well, yeah.
РОСС: Okay. Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, you mean lager.
РОСС: Ah yeah. Good times.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Hello?
ФИБИ: Hey, Mike, it's me. Listen, is um, is Ross near you?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, no. I just left.
ФИБИ: Well, you have to go back in.
НЕДРУГ: Wha? Go back? To the land where time stands still?
ФИБИ: I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to intercept all his calls.
НЕДРУГ: I can't do that!
ФИБИ: He says he can't do that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh give me, Hi, Mike? Hi. Listen. I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what? If you do this I. Phoebe will, do anything you want. Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
ФИБИ: All right. Hello? Hi. I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
НЕДРУГ: All right. I'll do it. But really, how much dirtier can it get?
ФИБИ: Oh, Mike. Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Hey buddy.
РОСС: Uh, hi.
НЕДРУГ: Um, can I come back in?
РОСС: Why?
НЕДРУГ: I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.
РОСС: But you left.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
МОНИКА: Chandler! You're home!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.
МОНИКА: What are you saying?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey said that you're in here with another man.
МОНИКА: There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
ДЖОУИ: All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is he doing?
МОНИКА: I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
ДЖОУИ: Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.
ДЖОУИ: Why do I smell men's cologne?
МОНИКА: I think that's you.
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's nobody here Joe.
ДЖОУИ: I guess not.
МОНИКА: I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.
МОНИКА: Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
НЕДРУГ: So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it.
РОСС: Maybe you should look up fascinating.
НЕДРУГ: I'll get it. Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking. It's for you.
РОСС: I don't understand what just happened here.
ДЖОУИ: What's going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know. I didn't think you'd understand.
ДЖОУИ: What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, Duh.
МОНИКА: Joey?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
МОНИКА: You can go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? You're gonna be okay?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
МОНИКА: It's gonna be so hot!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, bye.
МОНИКА: Have fun.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. Here's your ticket.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks man.
ДЖОУИ: Where are you going?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Game's tomorrow night Joe.
НЕДРУГ: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Phoebe enter.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
РОСС: Oh God.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: I'm so glad you're back.
ФИБИ: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. So, what did you guys do?
РОСС: Oh, you know, we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
НЕДРУГ: It's true. I did.
ФИБИ: Well, good bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That was fun Pheebs.
ФИБИ: I know. That was fun.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See you guys.
РОСС: Rachel, lock the door. Lock the door, seriously.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh shoot. I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks. Wait, wait. Sorry. Did he call? Did that guy call?
НЕДРУГ: No. Just his mom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, around 8:30?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then, again at 9:00?
НЕДРУГ: uh-huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Hello. Ah, no, she's not here right now. Can I take a message? Bill from the bar? Okay, Bill from the bar. I'll make sure she gets your number.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aaah.
РОСС: So, ah. So, how was it? Uh, did you guys. Did you guys have a good time?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it was so much fun. It felt so good to be out.
РОСС: Uh, Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
РОСС: Never mind.
РОСС: Hey you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.
НЕДРУГ: Stout. That's a kind of beer.
