МОНИКА: Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
МОНИКА: No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
МОНИКА: What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is the point of having them if we never use them?
МОНИКА: Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will explain it to her.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
ДЖОУИ: wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap. TV announcer: Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo! TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives. Joey's eyes become large and he stands up.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you going to do?
ДЖОУИ: I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani. Like, like I was some kind of idiot.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you proved them wrong.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Opening Credits Ross and Rachels Apartment Ross and Rachel are putting baby stuff together like they're going to be.

РОСС: That was me.
НЕДРУГ: No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.
РОСС: Still me.

РОСС: Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. All me. Monica and Chandler's Apartment.
МОНИКА: Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.
МОНИКА: I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
МОНИКА: well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
ФИБИ: Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
ДЖОУИ: Hey happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey, what's going on Joe?
ДЖОУИ: I. I. I need a good lie.
ФИБИ: Oh okay. How about the whole man walking on the moon thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
ФИБИ: Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
ДЖОУИ: I do not.
ФИБИ: Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
ДЖОУИ: Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's and he said. He said. Joey you stink at lying. What am I going to do?
ФИБИ: Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
ДЖОУИ: Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
ФИБИ: Sure, what, what was the work thing?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his.
ФИБИ: Pick up grandma at the airport?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man. Ross and Rachel's Apartment.
НЕДРУГ: Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to get your real nose?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Amy! Yes I do. I really do.
НЕДРУГ: Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
РОСС: Sure, we don't live there but.
НЕДРУГ: Seriously? Its, its just these rooms? I thought you were a doctor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
НЕДРУГ: Ew.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God she is unbelievable.
РОСС: I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
НЕДРУГ: Stupid Thanksgiving.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What happened?
НЕДРУГ: My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.
РОСС: Don't say that.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
РОСС: Sure, you want to go upstairs?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um look I was thinking. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
РОСС: You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
РОСС: Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you know what? She may need one. We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
ДЖОУИ: Hap. Hap. Happy Thanksgiving.
РОСС: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hey you.
МОНИКА: So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah I. I think so. sticks her hand out to shake hands with Phoebe and says to her It's nice to meet you Emma.
ФИБИ: PhoeBe.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. That's a funny noise.
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, I still need some help here.
ФИБИ: Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
ФИБИ: You are a terrific actor.
НЕДРУГ: Hey. Hey where's the baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh we just put her down for a nap.
НЕДРУГ: Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.
РОСС: Thank you Amy.
НЕДРУГ: no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.
ФИБИ: Thats a great movie.
НЕДРУГ: Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily. Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel and Ross.
РОСС: Emma.
НЕДРУГ: Emma, Ross wants you.
ФИБИ: PHOEBE.
НЕДРУГ: Why does she keep making that noise?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.
НЕДРУГ: Well who would?
РОСС: Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
МОНИКА: yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.
НЕДРУГ: I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
НЕДРУГ: Connected? I mean, to what? She's, she's a lump.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two, that you two.
НЕДРУГ: This guy? Seriously? Later in the day.
МОНИКА: Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china, um and its very expensive so please be careful.
РОСС: Woah. Woah, nearly really drops the plate and more seriously Woah.
МОНИКА: Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
МОНИКА: No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe I won.
НЕДРУГ: Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica is Ross' sister.
НЕДРУГ: No, Ross' sister was really fat.
МОНИКА: That was me.
НЕДРУГ: No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly, you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate.
МОНИКА: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this. Monica holds a turkey leg up in the air over the plate trying to cut meat off with a knife.
МОНИКА: Now see, this way you protect the plate, and lets face it you have fun.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, if crazy plate lad. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well actually.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually what?
РОСС: well, its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: Hurts, doesn't it?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, who has to die for me to get her? Everyone is looking around and at Joey with looks of 'what?' on their faces Commercial Break.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
РОСС: No, that that is not what we're saying.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well what is wrong with me? Am I, am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just, you're more the fun parent.
РОСС: Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin, someone who can be firm and strict.
МОНИКА: Thats not how you see me, is it?
ФИБИ: No you're all about the fun.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
РОСС: No, you both are equally capable. Its just, you're strongest when, when you're together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
РОСС: Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
ДЖОУИ: I lie better then that, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
ФИБИ: There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
МОНИКА: Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
МОНИКА: Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
МОНИКА: No you learn these things. You grow into it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
МОНИКА: I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad, at the fun parts and the hard parts.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying Go to your room! You're grounded?
МОНИКА: Can you hear me say You're grounded?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said that to me last week.
МОНИКА: How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.
ДЖОУИ: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me. And they all got to meet Santa!
ФИБИ: It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
ФИБИ: Ooh, what happened?
ДЖОУИ: Oh. My sister's raccoon.
ФИБИ: No! Nothing with a raccoon.
ДЖОУИ: Arg. Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door.
МОНИКА: Oh wait. What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Setting the table.
ФИБИ: Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
МОНИКА: Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy, yeah, thats the techinal term. He goes to Chandler.
РОСС: Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok.
НЕДРУГ: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: UCHH!
НЕДРУГ: You know, this, this is classic Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah right. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
НЕДРУГ: This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What carrer?
НЕДРУГ: Um. I'm a decorator.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
НЕДРУГ: Why can't you ever be supportive?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sup. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Yeah. Well. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did the first time! Oh. Oh. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
РОСС: Emma.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
НЕДРУГ: How hard could it be? You do it.
ДЖОУИ: ooh oooh.
НЕДРУГ: Do you want to know why you don't want me to have the baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: uh huh.
НЕДРУГ: Because you don't want me to be happy. You, you have always been jealous of me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
НЕДРУГ: Uh. To name a few. You know. You know. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
НЕДРУГ: Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30 discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
НЕДРУГ: You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
РОСС: Too far, Amy. Too far.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You take that back.
НЕДРУГ: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Take it back!
НЕДРУГ: No! What are you going to do? Make me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Heey man, I work out.
НЕДРУГ: So do I.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do pilates.
НЕДРУГ: I do yoga.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bring it on!
МОНИКА: Put the plates in the boxes! Put the plates in the boxes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you just push me?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, yeah I think I did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright. Thats it!
МОНИКА: Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel and Amy 'fighting'. They're really just trying to slap each other and just keep slapping their hands.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!
ФИБИ: Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
ДЖОУИ: What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them. Amy starts spitting on Rachel's hand and Rachel is saying ew and pushes her away.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ew! Gross. Amy runs towards Rachel and Rachel puts her arm out, hand on Amy's head and Amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, Rachel is moving backwards towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon, I'm so sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
РОСС: Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? Well thanks.
РОСС: So, so now do I get Joey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you okay Mon?
МОНИКА: uh huh. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
ФИБИ: It's all right. You can mourn.
МОНИКА: Thank you. It was so beautiful. gets up and walks towards the front door I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
ДЖОУИ: Actually its not pies, its just pie.
МОНИКА: I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Amy, it got a little of control. Um, and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh, if it really means that much to you.
НЕДРУГ: So you're going to give me the baby?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh. No. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
НЕДРУГ: You are not going to regret this. they hug and Rachel has this disgusted look on her face and then Emma starts crying.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She needs changing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no no no. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well, what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first. top of box so thoroughly, there isn't an inch of cardboard which isn't.
ФИБИ: Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope.
ФИБИ: Broke them all, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep.
ФИБИ: You gonna tell her?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nope. Hey, so I'm gonna, put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
МОНИКА: Like only if the queen comes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe not even then.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
ФИБИ: No problem! Next week: stealing. Chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.
МОНИКА: Bye plates!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? Chandler walks back, looking angrily at Joey.
МОНИКА: What? Something happened with the plates?
ДЖОУИ: Uhm. Yeah, this uhm, raccoon came in.
