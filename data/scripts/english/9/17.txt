ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Ready to go?
РОСС: Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doin'?
РОСС: Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless.
РОСС: It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing, remember Andrea Rich?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
РОСС: Uh uh, well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bet she'd sleep with you now.
РОСС: No. I already e-mailed her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me see what you wrote about yourself: Doctor Paleontology, two kids. You split with Carol because you have different interests?. I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
РОСС: You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: What do you think you learned how to do in the last two minutes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe we finish this for him! Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had, aaand SEND!
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, what do, you can't do that to him!
РОСС: Alright, let's go!
ДЖОУИ: Dude!
РОСС: I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
ДЖОУИ: aaand SEND!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! How was basketball?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no! Who did that?
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, hey. Rach, what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, of course, yeah, it's a stuffed animal, you know, it's for kids, not for adults. I know that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
ДЖОУИ: Rachel, let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Oh, Emma loves him!
ДЖОУИ: Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
ФИБИ: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hey Phoebe, how you doin'? You feelin' better?
ФИБИ: Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I'm so sorry!
ФИБИ: Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it, but. I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not gonna need my help?
ФИБИ: Well no, when I get to the point where, you know. I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike. I'm gonna come to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3. 4! I've just thought of a fourth.
ФИБИ: Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future, but, pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
МОНИКА: Ok, you got it!
ФИБИ: Unless. Maybe it's too crazy about this. Alright so, you know, there is no future, but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
МОНИКА: Really? If that's what you want.
ФИБИ: That was a test and you just failed.
МОНИКА: Damn it! Rookie mistake!
РОСС: I have sex with dinosaurs?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I believe I read that somewhere!
РОСС: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long. It's not funny!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I respectfully disagree.
РОСС: I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
РОСС: You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't have a page.
РОСС: Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!
ДЖОУИ: Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel, with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ:: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
ДЖОУИ: It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
ДЖОУИ: There you go sweetie. This isn't over.
МОНИКА: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as. gay as the day is long?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
МОНИКА: But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
МОНИКА: Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross, oh yeah, this will show him, here we go.
МОНИКА: What are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you'll see my friend.
РОСС: I'm dead?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And so young.
РОСС: Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, how you died was funny.
РОСС: Oh please, hit by a blimp?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It kills over one americans every year.
РОСС: Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my, my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
РОСС: You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
ФИБИ: God, I wish Mike were here.
МОНИКА: Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
МОНИКА: What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
ФИБИ: I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing, why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
ФИБИ: Here.
МОНИКА: And now your cell.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: This is your cellphone?
ФИБИ: Yes.
МОНИКА: This is your current cellphone?
ФИБИ: Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, where's your purse?
МОНИКА: No, no! Give it to me!
ФИБИ: You can't have it.
МОНИКА: Give it to me!
ФИБИ: No.
МОНИКА: I'll go in there.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah.
МОНИКА: Phoebe come here.
МОНИКА: Haha!
ФИБИ: Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, it's not a girl, it's, a brand new Hugsy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail.
ДЖОУИ: Make the transfer!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
ДЖОУИ: But he's the same.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
ДЖОУИ: But he's the same.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, come on!
ДЖОУИ: He's the same!
ДЖОУИ: You're not the same!
МОНИКА: Haha!
ФИБИ: You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
МОНИКА: So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
ФИБИ: Those are my shoes.
МОНИКА: Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
ФИБИ: Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
МОНИКА: Who's that?
ФИБИ: I ordered Chinese food.
ФИБИ: What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
МОНИКА: What are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe called me.
МОНИКА: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, I broke down. I wanted to see him.
МОНИКА: Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
ФИБИ: There is a speakerphone on the base unit.
МОНИКА: Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
НЕДРУГ: Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see.
МОНИКА: This doesn't concern you!
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
МОНИКА: Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
ФИБИ: Not if nothing happens. Why can't, why can't we just hang out as friends?
МОНИКА: Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.
ФИБИ: Sit down.
МОНИКА: Oh wow wow wow! Make room for your friend!
НЕДРУГ: So how've you been?
МОНИКА: I've been pretty good!
НЕДРУГ: You look really beautiful.
ФИБИ: Thanks, you look good too.
МОНИКА: Oh no no no no, this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
ФИБИ: So how's the piano playing going?
НЕДРУГ: Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
ФИБИ: I've missed you too.
МОНИКА: You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize, don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
РОСС: uhu uhu, check this out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out, and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
РОСС: Eh.actually no, I don't need to because your little Ross is dead joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, come on, you know that's not true.
РОСС: What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
РОСС: I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead. This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
РОСС: You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
РОСС: Exactly!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, what're you, what're you, what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
РОСС: No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, don't press send, don't press se.!
РОСС: oh, too late, too late! It's sent, oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
ДЖОУИ: Original or crappy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Original.
ДЖОУИ: No, sorry haven't seen him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then what's that big lump under your covers?
ДЖОУИ: It's Monica, ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's not Monica!
ДЖОУИ: Alright! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God.
ДЖОУИ:, she's being unreasonable!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
ДЖОУИ: It does?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
ДЖОУИ: Really? She, she loves me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't, but whatever.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if. If Hugsy means that much to Emma then, well she can have him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oooh, you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!
ДЖОУИ: Look forget it forget it. I can't do it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you gonna, you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
ДЖОУИ: How do you think I got him in the first place?
МОНИКА: Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
НЕДРУГ: I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
ФИБИ: I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
НЕДРУГ: It can't be any harder than this. I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I. I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time. I never would have stopped.
МОНИКА: Kiss him, you fool!
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
ФИБИ: Oh, I missed you so much!
НЕДРУГ: I knew you'd be here!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, crap!
ФИБИ: Who is this?
НЕДРУГ: My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
МОНИКА: Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
НЕДРУГ: Well, you are not doing a very good job!
МОНИКА: Excuse me?
НЕДРУГ: What's with the kissing?
МОНИКА: Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
МОНИКА: You didn't hear the speech!
НЕДРУГ: I've heard the speech: if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her.
МОНИКА: Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
НЕДРУГ: You're weak!
МОНИКА: You're, weird!
НЕДРУГ: Your pants are undone!
МОНИКА: Oh!
НЕДРУГ: Where did they go?
МОНИКА: Damn it!
НЕДРУГ: Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
МОНИКА: And I blame you too.
РОСС: It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There you go! Someone came!
РОСС: Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
МОНИКА: Hi, glad you could come.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please, come in.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes, yes, let me, take your coat.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks, uh. I'm so sorry about Ross, it's.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: At least he died doing what he loved, watching blimps.
РОСС: Who is he?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Some guy, Tom Gordon.
РОСС: I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
МОНИКА: So, did you know Ross well?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
МОНИКА: Yes, he is. Me.
НЕДРУГ: What? You. You. Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, listen. Call me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok!
РОСС: I'm dead and no one cares?
МОНИКА: I look like a man?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
РОСС: It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica, it's probably the way you stand!
РОСС: Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it. I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
РОСС: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
НЕДРУГ: Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kori? Kori Weston?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! You look amazing!
НЕДРУГ: And you are.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
МОНИКА: You are married though.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
НЕДРУГ: We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
НЕДРУГ: I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
РОСС: But you didn't! I'm still alive! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
НЕДРУГ: You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
РОСС: Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!
