ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
МОНИКА: I know. God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
МОНИКА: I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
МОНИКА: Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know, finding gold.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef, what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
МОНИКА: Ok worse case scenario is we borrow some money from my parents.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! We're not borrowing money.
МОНИКА: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was, well to always knock before going into the pool house, but the other thing was never borrow money.
МОНИКА: Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna go.
ФИБИ: Why?
НЕДРУГ: I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
ФИБИ: Oh you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
НЕДРУГ: I put that tube top on as a joke.
ФИБИ: I want you to stay.
НЕДРУГ: I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can.
ФИБИ: Why don't you turn them inside ou.
НЕДРУГ: Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
ФИБИ: I'll miss you.
НЕДРУГ: Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
ФИБИ: Great! Ok. I'll go get the tube top.
НЕДРУГ: No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now, and partly because I live above a known crack den but, mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So, do you want to move in together?
ФИБИ: Wow, Mike Hannigan. You sure know how to make a girl say Hell yeah!
НЕДРУГ: So we're doing it?
ФИБИ: Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ФИБИ: I've always wanted to live with a guy. Pick up your socks! Put down the toilet seat! No! We're not having sex anymore! It's gonna be fun!
МОНИКА: Hey Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Listen. I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
ДЖОУИ: I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good. But wrong.
МОНИКА: Ok first of all. It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
ДЖОУИ: Aww, I don't know Monica y'know, erm, lending friends money is always a mistake.
МОНИКА: But Chandler lent you money!
ДЖОУИ: And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
МОНИКА: Come on. I just need it for some rent and.and some other bills.
ДЖОУИ: Oh how much?
МОНИКА: Two thousand dollars?
ДЖОУИ: Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: That's right I am!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi you guys!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Oo what's in the bag?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh er, well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Oh baby-proofing. Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like. Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs! or er. Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again! Huh!
МОНИКА: Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. I was just going to do this myself.
ДЖОУИ: You're gonna do it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, women can. You can't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
МОНИКА: You're a pig. And you can't do this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
ДЖОУИ: The hardware store is right down the street.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There is a hardware store right down the street?
ФИБИ: Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe and I are moving in together.
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations! Good for you! Great!
ФИБИ: I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
МОНИКА: Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing This is what my sister would look like.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, she's not so cute.
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
ФИБИ: Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
НЕДРУГ: Yes dear.
МОНИКА: Is that a bit you guys do?
ФИБИ: Uh huh we're playing you two.
МОНИКА: We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes dear.
РОСС: I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean. I'm happy for you guys.
МОНИКА: I hear wedding bells.
ФИБИ: Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know. I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut you know.near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior. Oh my god I do.
РОСС: Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
ФИБИ: I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
НЕДРУГ: You ready to go?
ФИБИ: Yeah! You bet roomy!
МОНИКА: Don't you mean.groomy?
НЕДРУГ: What are you talking about?
ФИБИ: Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.
ФИБИ: China patterns!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is easy. Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen er. I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
ДЖОУИ: I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? What do you mean you know?
ДЖОУИ: Err. I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Right.
ДЖОУИ: That's the fastest I have ever thought!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Anyway, err. I need to borrow some money.
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
ДЖОУИ: Err. Well I. Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh ok.
ДЖОУИ: I am on fire!
НЕДРУГ: Listen this is really nice. Do you. Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
ДЖОУИ: Err. Kind of.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
ДЖОУИ: Oh no no no no no. It wasn't. It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Something personal.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me.
ДЖОУИ: Boob job.
МОНИКА: I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
ДЖОУИ: Well it's. It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
НЕДРУГ: Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little groomy joke.
ФИБИ: Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
НЕДРУГ: I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is, maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
ФИБИ: Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
ФИБИ: What do you mean?
НЕДРУГ: Look. Phoebe, II love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
ФИБИ: Oh. Wow.
НЕДРУГ: It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
ФИБИ: Was it really that bad?
НЕДРУГ: At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.
ФИБИ: Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
НЕДРУГ: Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
ФИБИ: But it's just.
НЕДРУГ: Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
ФИБИ: Oh!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
ФИБИ: No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
НЕДРУГ: Trust me, I will never.
ФИБИ: Yeah I get that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: So you gave in and decided to call someone?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
НЕДРУГ: You're all set.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm. Your game.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Rach! There she is. My perfectly proportioned wife.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
МОНИКА: Thank you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no.don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not, two, single things.
МОНИКА: Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
МОНИКА: Ok. You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well yes yes. You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean. I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
МОНИКА: I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
МОНИКА: Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No you really think that's what it is?
МОНИКА: You heard him! No bigger! You're perfect! Just don't get any bigger! Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!
ФИБИ: Hi.
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
РОСС: Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
ФИБИ: No. I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
РОСС: Why?
ФИБИ: Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
РОСС: Never?
ФИБИ: Never.
РОСС: wow, are you still going to move in with him?
ФИБИ: I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
РОСС: Yeah, marriage, stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
ФИБИ: That's not how you really feel is it?
РОСС: No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
ФИБИ: Seriously? You divorce-o?
РОСС: If you have to call me name, I prefer Ross the Divorcer. It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian, and once afterward. I'm sorry.
ФИБИ: It's ok that's how you feel.
РОСС: But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
ФИБИ: I do love Mike.
РОСС: Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
ФИБИ: Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
РОСС: The Divorcer, to the rescue!
ФИБИ: It's not cooler.
РОСС: Yeah I just hurt it.
ДЖОУИ: Rach?! Rachel!? So I can't do anything I like?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Rach! Ah. Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
МОНИКА: Honey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
МОНИКА: About that? Erm. I'm going to change.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But honey you don't have to.
МОНИКА: I'm going to get bigger!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey I. I love your breasts the way they are!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Argh. fascist.
МОНИКА: Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: your ass?!?!?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They do that?
МОНИКА: It's kind of a package deal!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
МОНИКА: I thought I was something that we both wanted!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
ДЖОУИ: Because she is!
МОНИКА: Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
ДЖОУИ: Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
НЕДРУГ: It's over Joe!
ДЖОУИ: OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
РОСС: Hey! What do you guys think about this. Ross: The DivorceForce.
ФИБИ: Better.
НЕДРУГ: Very cool.
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
РОСС: Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
ФИБИ: What do you mean?
РОСС: Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
ФИБИ: They are awfully boxy.
РОСС: I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so, normal.
ФИБИ: Uh huh.
РОСС: Hey hey, can I help?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well! We er.climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul, but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
РОСС: You know sometimes your words, they hurt.
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
ФИБИ: Just one last time erm, the marriage thing, there's no wiggle room? None at all?
НЕДРУГ: No but. You don't want to get married either right?
ФИБИ: Right. Except that I do want to get married.
ДЖОУИ: Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
НЕДРУГ: You wanna get married?
ФИБИ: Someday.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aaaaand, hernia.
ФИБИ: I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
НЕДРУГ: But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
ФИБИ: Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
НЕДРУГ: I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
ФИБИ: But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
НЕДРУГ: Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
ФИБИ: Are you gonna change yours?
НЕДРУГ: No.
ФИБИ: Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
НЕДРУГ: But I don't want this to end.
ФИБИ: I don't want it to end either.
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, so. Goodbye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye bye Mike! Cya mike! Bye mike! Bye bye now!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm so sorry Pheebs.
МОНИКА: We're all sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
