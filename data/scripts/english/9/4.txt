НЕДРУГ: I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house.
НЕДРУГ: well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
НЕДРУГ: hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
НЕДРУГ: of course she has… if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
НЕДРУГ: but you did say it
НЕДРУГ: yes, yes I did… and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-à-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her… super-serious relationship with… Vicrum.

НЕДРУГ: so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
НЕДРУГ: well that's not even the weird part… I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
НЕДРУГ: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
НЕДРУГ: yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
НЕДРУГ: what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
НЕДРУГ: and who's fault is that.
НЕДРУГ: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night
НЕДРУГ: HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
НЕДРУГ: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
НЕДРУГ: yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
НЕДРУГ: Interesting… all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it OH SALT BLOATY!
НЕДРУГ: Joey, Joey.
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
НЕДРУГ: No… wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
НЕДРУГ: It's open.

НЕДРУГ: HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!
НЕДРУГ: YAY! quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
НЕДРУГ: What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
НЕДРУГ: oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that…
НЕДРУГ: WHAT!
НЕДРУГ: umm… that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
НЕДРУГ: WHAT! WHY?
НЕДРУГ: well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
НЕДРУГ: If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!
НЕДРУГ: well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
НЕДРУГ: Good yeah just be honest with him.
НЕДРУГ: yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave… which he will and that's ok… so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be… it'll be fine… it'll be fine… I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh
НЕДРУГ: I'll get it
НЕДРУГ: ok
НЕДРУГ: You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?
НЕДРУГ: Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called.
НЕДРУГ: so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.
НЕДРУГ: Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: How could you not remember that we slept together?
НЕДРУГ: What! When?
НЕДРУГ: I dunno!
НЕДРУГ: I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
НЕДРУГ: come on, come on, search your brain all right… it was a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
НЕДРУГ: no it's not ringing any bells.
НЕДРУГ: my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
НЕДРУГ: Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
НЕДРУГ: Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it. so were good. I'll let myself out.
НЕДРУГ: …and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
НЕДРУГ: yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
НЕДРУГ: that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
НЕДРУГ: I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
НЕДРУГ: I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but… maybe me.
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me… although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
НЕДРУГ: ok I can't do this.
НЕДРУГ: what's wrong?
НЕДРУГ: well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so… if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me.
НЕДРУГ: uh huh
НЕДРУГ: so you don't think I'm a total freak
НЕДРУГ: No… well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
НЕДРУГ: I guess so, can I… can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
НЕДРУГ: Definitely
НЕДРУГ: This is Vicrum.
НЕДРУГ: Hi honey I'm home!
НЕДРУГ: Hi, how was your flight?
НЕДРУГ: oh it was great.
НЕДРУГ: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I… have a little surprise for you.
НЕДРУГ: well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
НЕДРУГ: Ok This is how much I love you.
НЕДРУГ: Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
НЕДРУГ: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
НЕДРУГ: no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
НЕДРУГ: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
НЕДРУГ: does what always have to be sharks.
НЕДРУГ: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
НЕДРУГ: What's going on?
НЕДРУГ: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
НЕДРУГ: let ME be a part of this!
НЕДРУГ: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa… angry sharks turn you on!
НЕДРУГ: no they don't
НЕДРУГ: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
НЕДРУГ: OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn
НЕДРУГ: really?
НЕДРУГ: yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
НЕДРУГ: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
НЕДРУГ: You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
НЕДРУГ: Im very, very drunk right now.
НЕДРУГ: see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her? Phoebe: you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
