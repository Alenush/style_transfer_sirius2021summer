ДЖОУИ: Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
РОСС: Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
ДЖОУИ: Mmh-mmh.
РОСС: Can you say Barbados?
ДЖОУИ: Barbados!
РОСС: Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh. I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you have anything that would, get us out of them?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah Ross, I mean, we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, island's stuff.
ФИБИ: I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
РОСС: Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
ФИБИ: No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
РОСС: Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
РОСС: It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
НЕДРУГ: Wow! This place is beautiful!
РОСС: Look at all these paleontologists!
ДЖОУИ: I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
ДЖОУИ: I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
НЕДРУГ: Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
ДЖОУИ: That, never happens.
НЕДРУГ: I've been following your career for years, II can't wait for your keynote speech.
РОСС: Wow! This is very flattering, uh.
НЕДРУГ: I would love your autograph.
РОСС: Uh, uh. Sure! Um. Dear.
НЕДРУГ: Sarah.
РОСС: Sarah. I dig you, Uh? Doctor Ross Geller.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you so much!
РОСС: Yeah, oh and Sarah. I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
НЕДРУГ: Are you a paleontologist?
ДЖОУИ: No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called The Days of Our Lives.
РОСС: Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives, there's no the.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, Ross! It's. It's fun, yeah! No, II play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
ДЖОУИ: You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at?
МОНИКА: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
МОНИКА: See?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that's the same as it has something to do with wind.
МОНИКА: Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
ФИБИ: Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now, tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
ФИБИ: Mike? Who's Mike?
НЕДРУГ: Mike is your ex, uh, boyfriend!
ФИБИ: That's right! Oh, yeah. Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That'sThat's, a blast from the past!
НЕДРУГ: It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
ФИБИ: Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She does?
МОНИКА: Let's get you out of here!
МОНИКА: At least you took me down with you!
ФИБИ: I'm sooo sorry! I just. I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. WhyWhy do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
МОНИКА: I guess, in time.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
ФИБИ: You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
НЕДРУГ: Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wouldn't read too much into it.
НЕДРУГ: Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or. Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, I just. I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously, we're gonna do this?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, uh. I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know. Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
НЕДРУГ: That's great! That's great! II'll propose to her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't mean now.
НЕДРУГ: Why not? It's brilliant! Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding. Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
НЕДРУГ: How do you think I should propose?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: David, I'm pretending to read here!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
НЕДРУГ: I didn't mean a thong. I meant thongs.
ДЖОУИ: You really should have been more clear about that!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! ah! eh. Britney Spears!?
РОСС: Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
РОСС: Yeah, what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
ДЖОУИ: You could say: Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?
РОСС: Ready to go?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Wha? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
НЕДРУГ: Oh I can't. I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
ДЖОУИ: Will you wear a thong?
НЕДРУГ: I will if you will.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you got yourself a very weird deal!
РОСС: I'm good, I have dinner plans.
НЕДРУГ: So you'll be ok?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.
РОСС: Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
ДЖОУИ: No, why?
ДЖОУИ: Oh man!
НЕДРУГ: There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
ДЖОУИ: I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
МОНИКА: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do! Want a hint? huh? I do I do.
МОНИКА: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: David is going to propose to Phoebe.
МОНИКА: What? Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
МОНИКА: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
МОНИКА: They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say No, David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, that's some bad advice!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey what's going on?
ДЖОУИ: Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
МОНИКА: Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
ДЖОУИ: Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.
МОНИКА: Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
ФИБИ: Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
МОНИКА: And make sure our room isn't next to theirs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.
ФИБИ: Not Joey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
МОНИКА: Yeah, right!
НЕДРУГ: So, um. I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's um, one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is um, is quite poor.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
МОНИКА: Ok!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
МОНИКА: See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That would be advice!
МОНИКА: Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: I need to talk to you.
ФИБИ: Are you leaving The Supremes?
МОНИКА: Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
ФИБИ: Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
МОНИКА: What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha. What about Mike?
ФИБИ: Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: Mike, do you take Phoebe. You know, it's every girl's dream!
МОНИКА: Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
ФИБИ: Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike. David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
РОСС: By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
НЕДРУГ: It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
РОСС: Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet.
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys!
РОСС: The chocolates aren't here yet.
ДЖОУИ: Damnit!
НЕДРУГ: Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read?
РОСС: If you want to check your email, just ask!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? May I?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
НЕДРУГ: Actually the wet season is June to December.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not the time Charlie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
ДЖОУИ: Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your computer, I don't know wha, everything's gone!
РОСС: Wha, what do you mean?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
РОСС: What, oh my God. What did you do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
РОСС: Why, why would you open it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it didn't say This is a virus!
РОСС: What did it say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nude, pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
РОСС: What, what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
РОСС: NO! I don't!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now.!
ДЖОУИ: It's really gone?
РОСС: Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just feel awful.
РОСС: Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but, you know, you and Monica have the same I'm gonna kill you look? I can usually make it go away by kissing her.
РОСС: Get out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
РОСС: Well, what do you do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I usually go, play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
РОСС: I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
ДЖОУИ: I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
РОСС: I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
НЕДРУГ: Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
РОСС: Wha, what you really think we can do that?
НЕДРУГ: Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.
ДЖОУИ: Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh.
РОСС: Alright, ok, let's do it. Um, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating, um, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the, eh, there's the overview of the Triassic.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a Galaxy far, far away?.
НЕДРУГ: Hello?
МОНИКА: Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole I never want to get married thing and step up!
НЕДРУГ: Who is this?
МОНИКА: This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say yes but I know she really wants to be with you!
НЕДРУГ: He, he's gonna propose?
МОНИКА: I. I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
НЕДРУГ: Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
МОНИКА: You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!
МОНИКА: Well, I hope you're happy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
МОНИКА: Phoebe is going to say Yes to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe is going to say yes? That's, that's great!
МОНИКА: No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And there's not chance that will work?
МОНИКА: No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
МОНИКА: Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This vacation sucks!
ДЖОУИ: I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we, we can't do anything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
ДЖОУИ: Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We can't. We're not pharmacists!
ДЖОУИ: I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and. Eva Trorro, womba.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kate Miller?
ДЖОУИ: Kate Miller it is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And, that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
ДЖОУИ: In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
РОСС: Yeah, that's it?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Oh my God, we did it!
НЕДРУГ: Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
РОСС: Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
РОСС: Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
РОСС: Oh my God, I love you.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son, or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
РОСС: That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
НЕДРУГ: Your first marriage?
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: You're married more than once?
РОСС: No.
НЕДРУГ: So, why did you break up?
РОСС: Oh, it was, it's complicated, you know? She, she was, eh, gay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, this is so cool!
РОСС: Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
НЕДРУГ: No, it's just. I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
РОСС: Hey! High-five!
НЕДРУГ: Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
РОСС: My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
НЕДРУГ: Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: Oh, I knew all along.
РОСС: I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay.
НЕДРУГ: I know!
РОСС: And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
НЕДРУГ: I didn't do that.
РОСС: Me neither.
ДЖОУИ: Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
ДЖОУИ: Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts.
ДЖОУИ: But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
ДЖОУИ: There it is, you're blushing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
ДЖОУИ: You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
ДЖОУИ: Tell me who it is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
ДЖОУИ: What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, who is that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do ya?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
ДЖОУИ: Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
РОСС: Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.
НЕДРУГ: I had a great time.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Later! La.
НЕДРУГ: So, shall we?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. See you, bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Good night.
ДЖОУИ: Night.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, good night!
МОНИКА: I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have, something I wanna say.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh. Spit it out, David!
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Phoebe, uh, you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
ФИБИ: Sure, ok, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, Mike!
НЕДРУГ: It's David, actually!
ФИБИ: No, Mike's here.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Mike!
НЕДРУГ: Hi David. Chandler. Monica. Oh!
МОНИКА: IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
НЕДРУГ: Hi Phoebe.
ФИБИ: What are you, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: I have a question I need to ask you.
НЕДРУГ: I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
НЕДРУГ: Actually yeah, that'll be great.
НЕДРУГ: That's fair, you've had a long trip.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
НЕДРУГ: Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
МОНИКА: You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring.
НЕДРУГ: I have a ring.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, will you marry me?
ФИБИ: No!
НЕДРУГ: Um. Ha ha!
ФИБИ: I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
НЕДРУГ: We can have any future you want.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, I'm gonna take off.
ФИБИ: David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Just so I know, if I had asked first.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
НЕДРУГ: Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!
НЕДРУГ: Is it ok if I hug you now?
ФИБИ: Yes!
МОНИКА: BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
МОНИКА: I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
МОНИКА: The sun is out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
МОНИКА: Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo!
МОНИКА: Damn it!
РОСС: Walls are pretty thin, guys!
РОСС: Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan, so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
РОСС: Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not to mention the cold sores.
РОСС: And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
РОСС: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ДЖОУИ: He said erectus!
НЕДРУГ: You're, you're kidding, right?
ДЖОУИ: No, he really said it.
РОСС:, and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus.
ДЖОУИ: Erectus?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Homo.
РОСС:, in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
РОСС: Oh, thanks guys!
НЕДРУГ: I thought, it was wonderful!
РОСС: Oh!
НЕДРУГ: Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone, so, young, and.
РОСС: Ok, now, now we're just holding hands!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! Well, uh, we're gonna hit the beach?
МОНИКА: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was really, great!
РОСС: Oh, thank you so much!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and so funny!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
РОСС: Ok! All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
НЕДРУГ: Oh. I'm back!
РОСС: Ok! Uh, excuse me? Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
РОСС: Hey! Well?
НЕДРУГ: You were incredible!
РОСС: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: You blew them away!
РОСС: Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean, uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
НЕДРУГ: I was not!
РОСС: No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
РОСС: I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
РОСС: Look, I took it too far!
МОНИКА: I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!
ФИБИ: Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
МОНИКА: So, what are we gonna do today?
НЕДРУГ: They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
МОНИКА: Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't think so!
МОНИКА: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
МОНИКА: I'm not always that bad!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
МОНИКА: I punched you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And?
МОНИКА: Phoebe?
ФИБИ:, and?
МОНИКА: I clunked your heads together!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! There you are!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it. I'll do it alone, but. I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you.
НЕДРУГ: You know. I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ:, is it weird that it's not with each other?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! A little bit, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: I think we need to talk.!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I think we do, about what?
МОНИКА: C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
ФИБИ: All right, all right. I'll play if we don't keep score!
МОНИКА: But then how do we know who wins?
ФИБИ: Nobody wins!
МОНИКА: So, we're just four losers. SUPER!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not playing with you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I'm out.
НЕДРУГ: I'll play ya!
МОНИКА: OK!
ФИБИ: Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
НЕДРУГ: I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
МОНИКА: Sure! Got to!
МОНИКА: Aww!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, by the way. I'm awesome!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh dear God, there's two of them!
НЕДРУГ: You're ready to play?
МОНИКА: Hell, yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you know this about him?
ФИБИ: No idea! I though he was soft like you!
НЕДРУГ: Wanna make it more interesting?
МОНИКА: How much were you thinking?
НЕДРУГ: Ten bucks a game?
МОНИКА: Make it fifty!
НЕДРУГ: I'll make it a hundred!
МОНИКА: One thousand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK!
НЕДРУГ: To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
МОНИКА: No. Either of you girls got a quarter?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
ФИБИ: Monica, you call it.
МОНИКА: Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
ФИБИ: Tails!
МОНИКА: Ow, what are the chances!
МОНИКА: Ha! My point!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
ФИБИ: He was a lawyer!
НЕДРУГ:, all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Weather bitch!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's open! Hi, Joe!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, is everything ok?
ДЖОУИ: Uh. Charlie and I broke up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooooo, why?
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's crazy!
ДЖОУИ: No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
РЕЙЧЕЛ:, yeah, it's true.
ДЖОУИ: I mean, she should be with someone like. Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, hey!
ДЖОУИ: Ok, Rach!
ДЖОУИ: I feel so stupid, you know? Why, why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: WWhat are you, what are you talking about?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like. What the hell is my problem? OH!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, uh, maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl.
ДЖОУИ: I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I'm not talking about her.
ДЖОУИ: But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know? Forget it!
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, IIII don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
ДЖОУИ: Ok! All right, well. I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll. I'll see you later!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure!
ДЖОУИ: You like me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
ДЖОУИ: That's a huge thing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
ДЖОУИ: What, for how long?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Only like a month!
ДЖОУИ: A MONTH?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What the. DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about, you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
ДЖОУИ: I just have one question!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shoot!
ДЖОУИ: What the hell are you doin'?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know. I mean, aren't you just a, little curious, what that would be like?.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as, as. George!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who?
ДЖОУИ: CURIOUS GEORGE! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, he had a paper route.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
ДЖОУИ: No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no, this, this can't happen!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But can it, just, happen a little bit?
ДЖОУИ: NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But why, why not?
ДЖОУИ: Because, look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
ДЖОУИ: I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right. I'm sorry.!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
ДЖОУИ: NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li, hey, like you said: no big deal!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not a big deal!
ДЖОУИ: NO BIG DEAL!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's so not a big deal!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, I.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: AAAHHHH!
МОНИКА: Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
НЕДРУГ: Do you?
МОНИКА: Ah, yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Do you?
МОНИКА: Ah, yeaaah!
НЕДРУГ: DO YOU?
МОНИКА: AH YEAAAAH!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you really find this attractive on him?
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you, you're not even, a little turned on by Monica, right now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
ФИБИ: C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
МОНИКА: Oh, damn it!
ФИБИ: I sleep with him!
НЕДРУГ: Game, point!
МОНИКА: Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
НЕДРУГ: You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
МОНИКА: NO, NO, NOOO!
НЕДРУГ: And that's how it's done!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
МОНИКА: Best out of three?
НЕДРУГ: That's what I'm thinking.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
МОНИКА: Serve the ball, chump!
НЕДРУГ:: Serve the ball, chump.
ФИБИ: Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
НЕДРУГ: I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
РОСС: Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
НЕДРУГ: Jarvis?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you're back, this is my wife, Nancy.
РОСС: Get Out!
НЕДРУГ: Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
РОСС: Yes, please! So, what's going on?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, well. Joey and I broke up.
РОСС: Oh my God, wh-what happened?
НЕДРУГ: Joey is a great guy, but we're just, so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
РОСС: I knew that was him!
НЕДРУГ: Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
РОСС: Hey, you ok?
НЕДРУГ: I guess. There was um, there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else.
НЕДРУГ: Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
РОСС: Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
НЕДРУГ: Or we could throw you both in now!
РОСС: Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I, you-you will have to catch us first. GO, GO, GO!
НЕДРУГ: Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, look! Enough is enough!
МОНИКА: No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
МОНИКА: I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But.
МОНИКА: Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about the obsessive cleaning?
МОНИКА: That's just good sense!
МОНИКА: Aww!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You ok?
МОНИКА: No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
НЕДРУГ: So you forfeit?
ФИБИ: Mike wins?
МОНИКА: I can't believe it! I lost!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you didn't.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I'm gonna play for ya.
ФИБИ: You can't do that!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
ФИБИ: Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
МОНИКА: Honey, you don't have to do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
МОНИКА: But, you suck!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're welcome, sweetheart.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
НЕДРУГ: Ok!
МОНИКА: Oh my God! You're good!
ФИБИ: It's like watching porn!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that's, how, it's done!
МОНИКА: Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
МОНИКА: Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know.
МОНИКА: This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's why!
НЕДРУГ: Thanks!
РОСС: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Are they still looking for us?
РОСС: Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
РОСС: I don't think they saw us.
НЕДРУГ: I don't think they did.
НЕДРУГ: Um, so, I started to say you something earlier, um. There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I, was starting to have feelings, for someone else.
РОСС: Oh. Can I, can I ask who?
НЕДРУГ: I think you know.
РОСС: I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so.
РОСС: I'm sorry, we, we can't.
НЕДРУГ: All right, all right.
РОСС: I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
