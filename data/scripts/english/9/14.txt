ДЖОУИ: Morning, roomie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
ДЖОУИ: Fifth day's a charm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
РОСС: Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so.
ДЖОУИ: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye!
РОСС: Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
ДЖОУИ: No, hey, it's been great.
РОСС: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump.
РОСС: Yeah, that'll do it.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! So, how are you?
РОСС: I'm, I'm okay.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РОСС: Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
ДЖОУИ: Well, actually it.
РОСС: No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
ДЖОУИ: Wow, really?
РОСС: Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me.
ДЖОУИ: Sure, I know lots of girls.
РОСС: Yeah? Any names come to mind?
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, names?
ФИБИ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
ФИБИ: What you got?
НЕДРУГ: Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots. Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
ФИБИ: Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
ДЖОУИ: I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
ФИБИ: Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
ДЖОУИ: Why are they doing this?
ФИБИ: I don't know. They're so perfect for each other it's crazy.
ДЖОУИ: You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
ФИБИ: I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
ДЖОУИ: I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
ФИБИ: I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
ДЖОУИ: Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids someone's gotta carry on the family name.
ФИБИ: You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down she's still in the bedroom.
ФИБИ: So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
ДЖОУИ: I know that just pushes them further and further apart.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, that's a great plan!
ФИБИ: Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan-laugh.
ДЖОУИ: Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
МОНИКА: Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
МОНИКА: Oh my god.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? What's the big deal?
МОНИКА: Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
МОНИКА: You want a job? Turn off Oprah, and send out a resume!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
МОНИКА: Oh, it's perfect.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah. Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
НЕДРУГ: Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
ФИБИ: Ooh, Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey. I'm so excited I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
ДЖОУИ: All right! Who is he?
ФИБИ: Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah.
ДЖОУИ: She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
ФИБИ: A teacher?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies. And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
ФИБИ: Well, Ross does. What. You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
ДЖОУИ: Oh my god, you're right!
ФИБИ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: She even reads for pleasure!
ФИБИ: How do you even know a woman like that?
ДЖОУИ: What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
ФИБИ: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
ФИБИ: So now what do we do?
ДЖОУИ: Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
ФИБИ: What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
ДЖОУИ: Ooh. I hear that's bad.
ФИБИ: Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, yes, The Plan!
ФИБИ: It's not Santa's plan. No, it's.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
ФИБИ: No, I think we killed it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler funny is all I have!
МОНИКА: Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't do that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Today is the sixth.
МОНИКА: No, it's not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, it's also 2003.
МОНИКА: Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tough crib.
МОНИКА: Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
МОНИКА: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
РОСС: Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
РОСС: Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
НЕДРУГ: Can I get you another glass of wine?
РОСС: Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
НЕДРУГ: Got stood up, huh?
РОСС: Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
НЕДРУГ: Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
РОСС: No!
МОНИКА: We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
МОНИКА: So, let's do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I - I don't think I can.
МОНИКА: Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because of Emma.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry.
МОНИКА: Unless. Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start, canoodling in it.
МОНИКА: Canoodling?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I can't say hump or screw in front of the BABY.
МОНИКА: I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
МОНИКА: I guess you're right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
МОНИКА: But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
НЕДРУГ: I - I just have to say this you're really beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: I'm kind of funny looking.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich! Well, I'm not!
НЕДРУГ: So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs. That ain't gonna happen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, come on, Steve let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
НЕДРУГ: I lost it. To drugs.
НЕДРУГ: I silk-screen t-shirts now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? What's that like?
НЕДРУГ: It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
НЕДРУГ: Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
НЕДРУГ: I do like my hair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ФИБИ: Hello?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
ФИБИ: Hey, Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
ФИБИ: You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
ФИБИ: Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's not stoned.
ФИБИ: Did he go out for a cigarette?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, four times.
ФИБИ: My dear, sweet Rach.
НЕДРУГ: Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
ФИБИ: By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
МОНИКА: She's asleep. Chandler?
МОНИКА: What are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Emma was doing it!
МОНИКА: She's asleep.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can.
МОНИКА: Yes, but we have to be fast.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I'll try.
ДЖОУИ: Hello?
ДЖОУИ: Emma? Hey! Hi!
ДЖОУИ: How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
ДЖОУИ: You can't have SEX, when you're taking care of the BABIE!
НЕДРУГ: I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
РОСС: Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
НЕДРУГ: Look you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
РОСС: Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh.
РОСС: Just the crab cakes.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
НЕДРУГ: Just get out of here, okay?
РОСС: What's - what's going on?
НЕДРУГ: Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
РОСС: What? You - you're making money off my misery?
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
РОСС: This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
МОНИКА: Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think we may have really done it this time.
МОНИКА: Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You may wanna get some more of those too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Emma?
МОНИКА: Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
МОНИКА: Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: I - I can't believe I’m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don't touch my coat!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, Rach, how's it going?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
НЕДРУГ: Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
МОНИКА: Hey, did you stop by here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, then.
МОНИКА: Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What do you mean, there you are? Where was she?
МОНИКА: Oh, we were playing peek-a-boo. She just – she loves it when I'm dramatic.
НЕДРУГ: Why the hell did you take her?
ДЖОУИ: Because you two were having sex!
МОНИКА: No, we weren't!
ДЖОУИ: Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no.
МОНИКА: No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I gotta! Unless.
МОНИКА: Unless what?
ДЖОУИ: Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Why?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your family name is Tribbiani.
ДЖОУИ: You almost had me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, uh.
НЕДРУГ: Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but. Would you like to make love to me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really, really not.
НЕДРУГ: Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
РОСС: Hey, what's wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just had a rough night.
РОСС: Oh. Crab cake?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Eww!
РОСС: Well, what happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, I. It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but.
РОСС: Monica told me you had a blind date.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: I did, too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
РОСС: Why does everyone keep saying that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
РОСС: That bad?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
РОСС: Female body inspector? What size is that?
ФИБИ: Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
ДЖОУИ: It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
ФИБИ: Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
ФИБИ: Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
ФИБИ: Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
РОСС: The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
РОСС: Wait a minute you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
ДЖОУИ: We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
ФИБИ: Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
ДЖОУИ: Where?
ФИБИ: Mexico!
