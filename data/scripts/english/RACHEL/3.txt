Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy. Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi. How come you didn't come over earlier? Yeah, I just have to get dressed. Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing. You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear? Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind. What?! Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened? Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket? No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on. Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress? Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?! Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night. Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep. Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days. Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight. No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you. Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants? But I... All right. I'm not gonna gooo. No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going. Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. It's fine. I'm not mad. I'm just not going. Right. Um, hum. No. Right. Right, and the humiliating. Um, hum. Right. Yes, Ross. No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting. I think you *should* drink the fat. No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go! You were really gonna do that, weren't you? You were gonna drink the fat. And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds. Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way.... I'm going commando, too. I didn't know there were docks. Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed? Monica's making jam. Mon? 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.' What? What, what, what? Oooh. Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey. Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it. Nooo! Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on. Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work. All right are you guys gonna come down? Good luck Chandler. Bye hon. You're so pretty. Well, what happened to your jam plan? Are you serious? Down at the docks again? Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy. When did you go to a sperm bank? Phoebe, what are you doing? Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that. Oh my God, what happened? Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun. Ross's what? Honey, you got a little thing on your... Yeah. Hello. Noo way, Kevin. Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll? What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice? Men are unbelievable. Amazingly, that makes sense. Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents. Very nice touch. Unbelievable. Honey, this will help. Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it? Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases. Yeah, you do. This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof. Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof. Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser. Oh. G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that? Yeah, it is. Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented. Yeah. Yes, and grumpy. He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now. Hey Pheebs. Any sign of your brother? I thought you only met him once? Well relax, he'll be here. Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing. Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league? Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson. Hardy Boy. What about you honey, who would be on your list? Hi! Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans? Three of your five, what? Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. So? Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography. Well, it's about time. All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice. Oh! Come on! Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak. Oh-oh, you lie. Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate. Okay. Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn. Excuse me, there was no time! Does anybody need more coffee? Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is. That’s all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh? Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. Yeah, I know. Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some... meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see. Yeah, so? Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much. Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody? Oh, but that’s okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city? Okay! Bye! Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. What? Oh, sorry. Um, Barry. I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda. 'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.' Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay. Ross, my father doesn't hate you. But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like. Thank you. Hi Daddy! You remember Ross. Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster. Okay. Aw honey stop! It's not that bad. Yeah. That's Daddy. Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers. So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change. Well um, I don't. Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that. Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't. You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone. Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. Um. yeah. All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here. Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! Hi Daddy. What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here. What?! He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor... Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. Well that's his last name. It's Robert Bobby. And um, excuse me, he helps me. With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other. What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter. I'm sorry, let her? No. Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet. Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? Phoebe, what? Umm...what?! And all these people actually died? Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go. I promise. Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him. Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me? Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored. Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?! We're not?! All right, I like that. So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump. I cannot push it in! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Or. We could put a hat on his head. We need a hat.. Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!! Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though. Okay. Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today. Right. See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I? Okay, I heard that. Uh-huh. Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now. Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it. Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?! I also said number one. Hi! He's perfect, he's never been better. Well maybe he's just taking a nap. Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive. Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child. I did! I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing! I hope it's still funny when you're in hell. I'll get the hat. Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device. No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. Oh! That would be sooo much fun! Let's do it! Ross? Do you wanna play football? Um, there was a Geller Cup? Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. That almost hit me in the face. Monica, I'm your best friend. Ross! You don't pick me! You're stuck with me! Are you okay? Over here! I almost caught that one! Wait, what am I gonna do? Wait, how long? Okay. Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle. Can I see that for second. Now, does it really matter? All right, so are we not having dinner at all? I went really long. I can not believe your trading me!! Are you gonna let me play? Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!! No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me. God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too. Thank you! Break! I'm so sorry! Are you okay? I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do. Okay. I got a touchdown! We did it!! We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something. Oh shoot! I work Monday nights. What? Yeah. Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new? Eh, do you believe that? I'm gonna get back to retraining. Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too. Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry. I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks. Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that. Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts. The fear? Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'? I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here. Yeah. Can't I just look at the handles on them? Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice. Gunther, I quit. Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers..... Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?! I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!! No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting. You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear.... No. Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey. Thanks. Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me. I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans. Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you! I got the job! Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy. Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again. Wow. Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor. Good luck. Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan. I know! Op. Oh, you got me. Oh, that sounds great. Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much. Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it. Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in. Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom. Hi! Is my misery amusing to you? It's not funny, this is actually my job. Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger. Yes?! Do you want my pickle? The most unbelievable thing happened to me today. Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview! I know! Uh-huh! Yeah! His name is um, Mark something. What!? To be nice. I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell. Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job. I mean that's unbelievable. Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. That's all right. Hey. Did he call? Did Mark call? Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe? Music. Very nice. So, how are you? Oh yeah, what's it about? Yeah, I do. I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call. Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy. Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview! He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it. I got to figure out what I'm going to wear. Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo! Hey! What are you doing here? Oh. Hi. Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up. Me too! I know. Yeah. Yeah. Hi Mark! Oh, I did! Oh my God!! Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down. Honey, I'm sorry. Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes? Tell him. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox? Oh. Yeah. What kind of discount do we get? Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call. Hi honey! Oh, he's just goofing around. Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants. Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you! Ow! Ross!! Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic. Yes. All right Ross!! I get it!! You're hurt! Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do. Ohhh! That is soo sweet! Ross! So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? Right. Hello. A big idiot. Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now? Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. Where ya going? Ohh, with who? There was a woman at the... The stripper?! You have a play date with a stripper?! Sure, is she married? Oh. Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I... Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. Oh my God, I gotta go to work! Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late. I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay? For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work... I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past. Right. Somebody got in late last night. When did this happen? Monica, what are you doing? Hey. Do you have any ice? Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day? Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer? How often do you read it? Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining? Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women. All right. Okay. Yeah. Oh, Danny just went into room 217. Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it! Joey! I can't believe you just did that! All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy. Eh. Beth dies. Um-hmm. What?! No. She doesn't die. Because, I wanted to hurt you. Oh my.... Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up. What? Awwww. Joey? Do you want to put the book in the freezer? Okay. Hi, sweetie! I've got some bad news. I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. Nooo, he's leaving for a better job. Well we're gonna miss you around here. Yeah, you bet. Funny book? Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind. Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark. Oh my God!!! Ross!! Because, he's my friend. Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. Really!? Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What? Oh. Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks! Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!' Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah. Oh, that is so... Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark? It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life. Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay? What?!! Hello. Oh, hi. Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night. No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with. No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding. Oh!! My God, what are you doing here? Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis. Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop. But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone! Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I... None for me. I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!! Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing? Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop. I don't have ten minutes!! Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't! Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later. Good bye! Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger! But I told you, I didn't have the time! Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit me job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? Just a job! Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that... Well neither do I! Oh my God. Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard. I don't know, I don't know. Look, maybe we should take a break. No. A break from us. Hello! Oh. No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi! Yeah. Well, umm..... Yeah, I'm fine. No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay. Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry. Oh. Okay, bye. Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break. No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there. Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over. Hello. Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called. Nobody. Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home. You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend? Oh my God. Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. No. A break from us. Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break. Nobody. Umm, honey, look he just came over to.... Hey. Well, we never actually got to dinner. No, we kinda broke up instead. God, Monica it’s on the ceiling. Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over. No. No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work. Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine. So, I love you. And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30. Bye. Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now! Just get away from me! A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?! Ross, you had sex with another woman! Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! Just get out! Now!! Okay! All right! How was she? Was she good? Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she? Good different? Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?! And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! We were on a break! You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality? Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake! God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!! Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again. All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me? You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.... I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza. Fine. Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza. With ah, extra anchovies. Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce? Well, I should think so. You slept with someone. That’s.... That is neither here nor there. No Ross!! Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay? I think you should go. I really think you need to go now. Yeah, what the hell did I know! No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever. Then how come it is? Hey! Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee. Closer than here? Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee. Is he here? Oh. Here’s your moisturiser. Hi! You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right? Oh, well okay. Well, there you go. Hm-mm. Ohh! Oh, it’s okay. And heels. No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules. Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?! Okay. No. Thank you. Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ Well, if everybody’s going. What?! What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra. No, I stuff outside the bra. Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there. What, what’s it, what’s going on? So you know how to fix it? Great! Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27. I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here. Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us. No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here! No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else. Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!! What is he doing here?! All right!! Fine! Fine. Ask me what? You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come. Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier. All right, let’s go! Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else? Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine! What?! Really Joey? No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here. Yeah. Thank you. Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since. What’s your problem? Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City. Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks. Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this. Oh my God!! Great! Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. I think you should definitely go out with this guy. Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger? All right. Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya? Yeah? Thank you. Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable. We use it!! Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire. Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting. Oh yeah, sure, that too. Oh my God! The millionaire’s here! Hi!! Just one drink?! Thank you. Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!! Oh, okay. Wow! Umm.... I know. Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no. I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something. I don’t have any issues with my Father. Hi! Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here. No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think? Yeah? Good. Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop. Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug. You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt! Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty.... Petty... Petty... Small... You are so just doing this out of spite. Huh? You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore! yeah-yeah-yeah!! Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’ Y'know what? I can’t do this. Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you. Oh God. I’m sorry about this. You sure? Hey! Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair. Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... No. Nothing. Hey, Sophie! Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here. Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office? Summer catalogue! Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna. Bye, Chandler. Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore. No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone! Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too? Hey! I need to talk to you! Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler. Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you... That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all? Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me. Wow!! What’s this? All right! O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. Hmm. What?! Oh, I.... Oh, I know... Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her? You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’ Well, they always called. No. Sorry. Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. Well... No. I... Call her! Call her now! Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy! Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her! Well then you’re going to have to take her out again. I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! That’s fine! I know. Sophie’s desk. Chandler!! Are you gonna call her! Chandler!! Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates? What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass? And you’re still not attracted to him at all? Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher. Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday. I know. Ow!! Got a job on a river boat? Oh I see, so this suit is making a point. Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like. Yeah, come here! Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?! Oww! Oww! I’m fine, I’m fine. Yes I am! Look, I’m fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa! No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet. Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then. But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready. Look, either help me or go. Okay, but before you go, could you help me first? Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? Okay. Let’s use this brush. Yeah. Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. Oh-ho! Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye! Okay, just sweep it. Right. Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t... We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle. Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this? Blow it. Sophisticated like a hooker? Sure. Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing. Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed? Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around. I don’t want you to see me naked! Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird. What? Ross! Stop that! Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more! Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out! Rosss... All right. Fine. O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay? That’s it. Ow!!! Oh-ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Okay, I do. I really do. Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me? Okay. Thank you. Oww!!!! God! I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this. Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right? Okay. What thing? What thing? What thing? What is this thing? Oh my God! Ross, why didn’t you tell me that? I cannot believe you. That is the sweetest thing, I just.... Okay. Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening. Um-hmm, yeah. See ya. Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago. What’s Flimby’s? Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on! No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so. I meant, me plus one! Okay, bye-bye! Okay, I need a date! Oh, hi! How are you? Hey. Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!! Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.

You don’t?! Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men. What’s your favourite thing about summertime? Yeah! Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer? Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old. Phoe-be!! Hey guys! What's... Hi! Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before? Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher. What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you. Hi! And? Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them? So Pheebs, pick one of them. This place is amazing. Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!! Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!! Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we’ve got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it. Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian! OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet. Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist. Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. Oh my God. You didn’t break up with that fireman? Wow! How’d it go with Pete?! So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker? Why?! What is it? Yes!! Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob. Yeah. Oh, ah with who? Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again? Oh! That’s fine. Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies? This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You’re Bonnie? Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you. Oh, that must be it. You said she was bald. How could you not tell me that she has hair? Ohh, well, this is just perfect! Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head! Why, does she have a bad personality? Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl. Phoebe! Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is?

We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!! Yes. Yes. I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! What? Oh! Oh, I can’t watch this. I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex? That is so cool. Ohh, big, fat bummerrr. Hey! Ross gave it to me. Ohh, thank you. Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back. Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! Allll done! Okay, who's next?! Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before. Yes! Just once! Take it like a man, Ross! Oh, come on! Really?! Oh, yeah. Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers! All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas! I'm just making margaritas. What?! Oh, come on! Monica, please? He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something... Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?! Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night? Oh, great. I'm going for a walk. Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.

Now go shave that head! Aww Pheebs, that sucks! Hi! That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge. Hey! Come on see, she doesn't look that bad. I don't know. All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else? Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! Noo. Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me! Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so... I just, I feel, I-I just... I feel... Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
