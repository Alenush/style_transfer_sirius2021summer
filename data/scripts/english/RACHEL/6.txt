Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! Wait! Okay! Ohhh! I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on? Really?! Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot. Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid. I don’t know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night. Who got married?! No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous! Oh my God. No! Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? Hey, hubby! Uh-huh. Okay! So, we’ll just stay married. And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding. What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?! Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me. You are asking me to be your wife! Hey! No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married. Oh b-b-but it is! Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will! Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower? Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the... All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment? Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? Pheebs? Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment? Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. Oh? Yeah! Sure! Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie. Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica. Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?! What was that?! I haven’t seen it yet! Noooooooo!! Hey! Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel. I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky! What? Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys! And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together! And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late. Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God! Come and knock on my door.... Hey roomie! Are you pregnant?! Um-hmm. Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that. Okay. Sure? Thanks. Monica, where did you get these?! Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! Hey! Okay! Okay. What the hell is that? Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate! Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time. Are you okay? You’re not blinking. Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era. What is the matter with you?! All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe. Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry. But I... It is? Really? I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore? What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! I mean it’s the end of an era! Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing. Thank you. Pheebs, I wanna ask you something. Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful... ...how about I move in with you? You have a roommate?! Oh, that’s true. Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place. Pheebs, I have to ask you... You’re just staring into space. This one? Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full! Hey. Yeah! Why? That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you! Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you! Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything. What?! Oh my God! Are you serious?! I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you! Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero! Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! Hey! Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in. No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here! No-no, I’m staying put. Why, where are you going? Hi! Oh wow. Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird? Well, because of us! Because of our history. No? No! Not at all! Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating. Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend. But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky." Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied. No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out. Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy? Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back. All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later. Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s. So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine? And? Look at that! What?! No-no, I bought those. Yeah. Well, who wouldn’t?! And Mrs.?! What?!! Ohh! Oh God! Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you? Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring? Some uh, some visual aides. Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing? Pheebs, what-what are you doing? Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down? Monica! Did-did you take these back? Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they? Yeah. Nice try! Hey! Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before. Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes. Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches. Yeah, and not a very good one. Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice this time of year. No! They are mine! You stole them from me!! Yeah that seems fair. We never use them. Well? Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening! Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you. Really? Really?! Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you to come on board with us full time! Hey! Really?! How do you know? Oh, I’m sorry. Hello? Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message? Ross got married again? Nooooooo!!!!!!!!! Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!! I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!! When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married. So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now. Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs. Well there’s an idea!! That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for? December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause. Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye. Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you! Op! You’re peeping! Ross! Y’know what, I just got, why? Why did you do this?! I don’t wanna hear "Three failed marriages!" Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry! Ugh! Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. Uh yes, heroin and crack. Well, you would know. Ross, please, I found the magazines! Ugh! Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record? Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think. What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?! All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one! And thank you for your time. This is totally your fault! Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!! Don’t call us that! Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried. Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything! Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you! Nothing. Uh-hmm. Okay Ross, we’re, wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession. Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess. Yeah, don’t push it though. I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this. I’m gonna need a copy of those. Pheebs, I was wondering... Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. Yeah, yeah, I know. Surprise!! No, no don’t get mad because look... this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da! Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades. You remember when we got these? I guess you weren’t there. I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving. I have one. Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. You get your messages! So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Ooh, your brother. Score! You know what else I’m not gonna miss? "I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!" "I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" "Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!" I’m unpacking! I’m not moving! Is that picture straight? Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?! Well it’s mine too! What else you got?! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! Great! Monica’s moving! Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! Yeah, I’m just mad! Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving. Oh really? Like what Monica? Oh yeah, good start Mon. Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet. Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that. Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold. Oh, it’s gonna be fine. But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler. Okay. Oh! I have your key. Here you go. Yeah. Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! Bye house! Bye Mon. Yeah. Hi... Rachel... Phoebe’s... leave... Wait, I-I just said "leave." Phoebe, come on that's silly. No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch. Okay. Everybody... Rachel, Phoebe’s What? Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?! Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing. Yeah and there's really cute guys there. OK! Now wait a minute. You just took all the words! Okay. You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man. Oh! I used to do that too! Aw, Mon... Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her. You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth. Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever! Ankle. No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can! No, wait Phoebe. Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you. Well, I-I should've told you the truth. Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little... Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy. Because they're people. Yes, but still. They're people, with eyes. I-I am not uptight...Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man. Hey! Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great! Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress? Hey. Yeah. Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore. I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren. Yeah. A year ago.. But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much. Sure. Oh my God. Did you talk to him? What? What!?! You kissed him? Phoebe are you serious? Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married? Phoebe... Oh, Kim, Hi. So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought. Ahh. So. Wow. The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh? So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year. That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please. What? Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy. Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!! To get you to make out with him!!! Ohh, hi, Kim. Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen. Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true. No. Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him. I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job. I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren. You were with Kenny today, weren’t you? Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do? I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t. That wouldn’t help me. Kim, hi. Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore. Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine." Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad. You and Ralph? Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle! Nothing? So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert? Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done? Her dancer friends? Really?! I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing. Look at it, isn’t it beautiful? It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top! The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought well, there’s mincemeat pie, I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place? And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste. Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees! No! Yeah? No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic. Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like. Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle? So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright? Okay... What’s up, Ross? Yeah! Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this. I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea. I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now. No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry. Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert. No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time! It sure is. Beef. Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste. Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers! Op! Wait, you dropped a pea. Well? Really? How good? Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it. ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this? Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you! I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle! You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad! That’s a good story, Grandpa. So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her! Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing. Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet. We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK? Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas? Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why? That’s right! Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag! Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you. We are so gonna find them this year. Yeah. Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats. Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing? Ha! Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey! Hey, this is hollow. This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!! Oh, this one’s for me! Ooh, let’s open them! Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine. Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade? ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then! I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. We are looking at a Playboy. Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’ You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy I don’t know. Monica, what are you doing? Well, people are different. What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover. Oh my... you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. I cannot believe her. Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place. All right, wherever you wanna go is cool. No. Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there. Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine. Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin. Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second. Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky. So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky? Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover. I am not a pushover! Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard. How-how did you lose your job here? He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right. Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him. No, I really shouldn’t say anything. No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him. What? That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back. Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover? Oh, I’m sorry. Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs. Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick? Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls? Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. Oh my God, Jill! This is Chandler. And you know Monica and Ross! And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey. Don’t!! Honey, what are you doing here?! Wow! What did he say? Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me. Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off? Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us? Hey! What’s goin’ on? Jill! Did you shop?! You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible! What’d you get? Oh. Apartment pants? No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get? A Pashmina? Really? Jill? Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that! All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the Pashmina. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. Hey! What’s up?! Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it. What?! With Ross and Jill? With Ross and my sister? With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross? Oh there is no way. Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t. I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me. Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front. That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university. Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out? I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys. Yeah. Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross? Are-are you saying he’s a geek? No! No I, no Ross is not a geek! What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him! Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant. Yeah but, he’s not your type. Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you? She-she died Jill. Hi! Well yeah. Really?! Oh so-so not really never. Hi! Wh-what are you doing here? Well, I-I don’t like it. It’s kinda slutty. Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut. Rachel.

Yeah do it now, call right now. Hey! Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources. It’s not random, it’s Bob. No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to. Hm-mmm. Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history. No. Y’know Bob in Human Resources… Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just... I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do! Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have! All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob! In Human Resources!!!!!! ...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?! Do I have my own castle? No. Oh my God! Wow! I mean, I just...I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark. Absolutely not. Probably just the first half. Well it’s hard to tell.. Oh God, if she would just stop moving. Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t. Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula! Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere. Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her. What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?! Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! Oh! I knew it! What happened? What?! You kissed! Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing! Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that. What?! Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. Yeah, I got that. Bye-bye-e! Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce! Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend. Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me. Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be? Merrill Lynch? Well why didn’t you take the job? Rob Tillman! Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman. Ohh, of course Monica’s brother! Wow! How are you?! Ohh! Me too! Oh, it’s the best! So, umm how’s Monica? Ohh, I would love too. Ohh! Okay! Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?

I mean, Joey Tribbiani! Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break! Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want! Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right? Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin! Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!! Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions!

Umm, can I use your bathroom? Okay. God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment. Yeah, it sure is! Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins? Wow! Tell me something Joey......Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there. Okay. Yeah? Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands. Oh right. Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up! Noo! Oh God we did...we didn’t, we didn’t uhh... God I’m just a horrible person. Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck! Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person. The ring from the cave, yeah. Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?! No! No-no-no... But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother. Yeah! Ohh! My God! Barry!! Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!! Hi Ross! Is Joey Tribbiani here? Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up! Me? I’m great! I’m fine!

And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?! No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage? Aw what are you?! A detective? Oh. Who are these men? Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay. Good day for married people huh? I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either. Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya! Yeah! What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!! Isn’t that a kind of sushi? Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now! Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour. Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar! Aw, I love that. Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun. Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock! What the hell was that?! All right, so we weren’t prepared! Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. Yep! Oh, of course! Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick. Say it! Say it! I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over... Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women! I... Well, I don’t think they need any help. Who wrote it? Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl? Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages. Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops! Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place! Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go! My God! Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time. Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles. Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here. Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident. Okay! I have. I did. I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow. What? Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight! Oh. Oh, Joey! Sorry! Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain! Really? I’ve never lived like this before. I love it at Joey’s! Thanks! Hi! Uh-huh. No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here. No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here! I know. I’m sorry. Hi Joey, how ya doin’? Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.

Do you guys know any cute guys? Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go... I don’t know, something either trees or disease... Ralph mumbles a lot. Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date. Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux. Oo! When’s her birthday?! Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese. Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian. We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field &amp; Stream. What? I read that. Oh yes! Thank you! What? You found me a guy? Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity. Oh, thank you. What are you guys doing? Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number. I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you! All right. Yes, I’ll meet ‘em. Hi! Oh... I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night. What? Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good. I... Ohh! Yeah? Oh, hi. Yeah? Oh-okay, but Pheebs? I’m just sort of in the middle of something. Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go! Yeah, I’m good. No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! What is the matter with you guys? I.... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for? I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date! I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y’know... ....Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?! Thank you! Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. I wanna say a disease. Huh. All right. Oh-oh Professor Geller. So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Huh... Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac... Hey! You love those! Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor. Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! I'm sorry, what? Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself! Already? That’s pretty bad what you did. I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works. Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! What?!! You fell asleep?! Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! That is the most ridiculous... I did not sell you out. Would you let me talk. OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt Fine! Okay, Chandler! And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift." Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat. Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself. Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!! Be-because the last one was such a big seller? Hey! We do? Okay. Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here? Oh! Ross is sooo great! Oh hi! Oh! Well let’s look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them? All right! Oh good. Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul? Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy. You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter. Oh. We? Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just...I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’ Ohh. So you raised her all on your own? Ohh. Ooh! I was just getting him to like you. Ross, Joey is not here. Ross, it’s okay. You can come out. Bye! Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them... No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee. Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy! Wh...You dated my sister! What? Why?! Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer! Oh it’s important! So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me. Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom. Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake. Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily! I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage. Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. Maybe I have to pee again. Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is! Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too! What’s the matter? So what-what is the exhibit. Hi! I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. Umm. Yeah. Ooh, the gift shop! Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned. What?! No! Why?! I didn’t know you could get married here. Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here? Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it. I’m gonna do it too! Really? Who would, who would you marry? Oh Pheebs. Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house. It’s so secluded up here. I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry. No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I... would you... actually, would you go check on that? Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke? Okay. What?! What are you doing here?! I came with Paul! Get up! Ahh. Thank you! Op, ice. I need ice. Thank you. Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He’s in there! Go-go! Ohh, thank you. Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage. Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something? Well, why do y’know go in that room and do your homework? That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. That’s your dad’s bedroom! Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo! Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car. Surprise me. So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be! Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda! Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here? Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings. So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table? Hi! Okay. Okay. Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day. Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now? Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what... Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours. No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood! Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag. Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets? All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything! Okay. All right. Hm-mmm. That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. Oh! Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food? What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken! My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that! Oh my God! Oh my God!! Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster! What’s the other one? Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues. No you don’t! Hi. I’m back. Ah that’s great. No actually that’s...

Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it? I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking! Oh, I’m sorry. I... I-I don’t mean... I didn’t mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming. I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm... Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I’ll dump you too! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy! Nice! One and a half carat easy. Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em. Ohh... Hey! Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler? Oh my God, I’m so sorry. How about you guys? I think so. Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight? See? Now, he could date her. We’re just really..very excited about this charity event that we have to go to. Oh! Thank you! Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it. Uh, wh-why? Oh, hi! Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He’s the head of my department. And I also brought my friend Joey... Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is. Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars. Ugh! So close! What are you doing? Well now it’s an empty bar. What?! What?! What?! Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy! Joey! Sit down! What were you thinking?! Wh?! Why would a charity give away a free boat?! Ugh! Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink? How is you drinking helping the kids? Joey! Joey, good one! Hey! You...can’t...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me! I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference. Okay. Not great. Oh great! Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip? Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000. Okay. Okay. Ohh... Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name? Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam." Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont." Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h......arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can... ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy. What?! What?! But Joey you don’t have $20,000! Hey! Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!! Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married. Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen? No! I’m so happy for them! I’m so happy and not at all jealous. I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing. Yeah me too. Wh.. no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille. We’re gonna find love! Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though. Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other. Exactly! You do? Who? Joey?! Are you serious?! Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey. Oh, seriously? Charming. Yeah. Hey you! Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it? So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!" Exactly. What? Who? Phoebe?! Wait a...but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup. Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal! Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups! What?! Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one! Oh God, Phoebe! Oh. Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay? Pick one. You’re welcome. Joey! We should just switch. Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been! Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
