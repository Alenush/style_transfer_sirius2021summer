Oh my God, who is it?! For you. Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet. You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you. Oh yeah. Oh! Oh by the way? James Brolin? Ed Begley Jr. is not gay. No. No! Thank you. Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else. Phoebe!! Okay. Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him. Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now? Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding? Yeah. Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through! I don’t know! Maybe they have tools. Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave. Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well. I don’t know. Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe. Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it. I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!! What?! How many ways are there to do that? All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home. Okay. Thank you. Oh, you guys are so great. Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick. How much longer? 30 seconds, okay. Oh I know. I know. Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me. Okay. What? Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God. Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative? What?! Are you sure? Oh! Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game! Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! Ah, it’s still not the time. Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little! Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left. Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end. Hi. Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they? Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today. Ew! No! Well then you have his baby. Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news. Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything. Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant? Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant! Not yet. No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther. Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now! I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam! No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is! I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father. What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now? Uh, let’s rip! Oh Phoebe! Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? Oh, it’s just not the right time. Okay. Tag… I’m having a baby. You can go. Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now? Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra! No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight. I’m not? What? No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband. Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. Oh good you’re still here! I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What? How?! How do you know? Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know. I know! You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles. Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross! Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants. Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks. Hi! Hi. Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about. You do? Okay. What? Seriously. What?! Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now? I’m pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you’re ready. And you’re the father by the way—but you got that… Can I get you some water? Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time. They do! Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms. Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out… Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later. Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… Okay. If I said I was, would you judge me? Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn… Hi! Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here. Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head? Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross! What married? What, because that’s your answer to everything? Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we? Excuse me? What?! I can too eat by myself! When certain people leave the table and I am not finished! Oh please, you inhale your food! Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father. I do need you! I need you to stand near my head! Wow. There it is, I see it. Okay. I don’t see it! I can’t see it! I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby! Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now. No, I don’t see it! Yeah. That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you. Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby. Hi. Oh, everything went great. Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… Ross, I lost it again. Hi! Welcome home. Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture! Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey. And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me. What is? That-that you came on to me? But you did! I mean, let’s be honest. You know you kissed me first. I was sending you signals? Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now? No please, show me how I begged you! Oh Ross! Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? Hey! Is Ross still here? Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. Thank you. What? You don’t want to see this do you? I am not gonna show you this! I wanna see it. Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see? Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. Ah, a little preview! Okay, here we go. Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? There I am. I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I… I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today. Kinda hurtin’ my hand though. I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh… Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged. Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it? Oh I wanted to. Interesting. Oh yeah, sure. Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me. Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe? Okay, get ready to see some beggin’! What?! What are you talking about?! How do you know about that story?! I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy! No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams. So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? It was an amazing night. You think it looked amazing? Yeah, me neither. Yet… Yeah, it would be really weird. Good luck to you. Oh please. You are undressing very quickly. That’s what I was gonna say. Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend. Have you been working out? Really? Wow, this is so much better than I… Oh! Oh! Oh God! Oh, make it stop! Make it stop!! Have to make it stop!! Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?! You don’t know do you? Oh! Hi. Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm. Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash. Say hi to Wally. Hi! I thought I was a complete idiot. Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say? What?! Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant? Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay? Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all! Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?" Hi! Oh no, I can’t. I got a date. Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you? Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash! Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later. Thank you. Hi! Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think? I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant. Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want. He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch." Doesn’t he? Yes. Okay. Chandler M. Bing? Oh my God. Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard. Thanks sweetie. Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. Oh you did, there are twenty in here. Good night.
