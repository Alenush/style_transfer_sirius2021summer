I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that! You-you're not wearing a jacket. Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming. Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful. Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses. They're male nurses. Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say? What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go. What? Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them. Joey, how do you make that dirty? Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice. Yeah! Yeah! Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news! Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies! Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children! Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane. Me?! No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!! No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet. Y'know who I always liked? Mork. Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right? Hi! Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica. Hi! Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time. Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh? Yeah, fair enough. Oh, how does he look? How does he look? Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls. Yeah, umm, no honey. So does it really hurt as bad as they say? Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God! Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy! That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta? Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him. Why aren't you guys at the movie? So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man? I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! What-what-what are you gonna do? Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish. Chandler! Is he? Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late! For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes. Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay! Like what? Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help. Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to. Hi! Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy! Hi, guys! What's going on? Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too? Oh look! A letter from my mom. Oh yeah! I know. Oh my God! My dog died! Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog! Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God. It's Le Poo. Oh yeah! What? Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either. Hi! Okay, what's up? Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants. Yeah? That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died! Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. Storming out! Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! Hi! Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right? That's not Ross! Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip. Do you even know who Kip is? See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out! Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go. Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out. Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me! Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones. Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules? Oh, Ross... No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you. Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding! I know. I know that too. Yeah, it's in there. Uh-huh! Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please? I want the little round waffles. Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast! Arghhhh!!!!!! You guys! You guys! It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something! Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass! Yeah! Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny? Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you. Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something. Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it. Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you. Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry! Really? Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts! What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion! Hi! What? Yeti....I mean Danny? Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so. Y'know. What? What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me! So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here! Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants. And stop saying that! I hate that! Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you? What?! Okay. Okay. Hi! Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny. That yeti is one smooth talker. Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room. Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really, I don't mind. Ross, I.... Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down. I haven't seen him in so long! Ross, honey, is there anything we can do? Thank you. Mon? How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff. Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced. I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing. Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh? Ohh, great! Yeah. Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out. That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it? No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me? Exactly. Oh, hi Danny. Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy. Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala. It's a uh, regatta gala. No-no, but I support it. Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he? Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat. Ball? There is no ball. Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala. What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?! Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there! No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy. Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party. Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime. Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now? Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place! Oh, go on! You telling people about me? Yeah, okay, at ease solider! No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros! Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try." Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park! Yeah! Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us. Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for. Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you? I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving. What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?! Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about. No, it wasn't. It was actually the..... Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building. Oh hi! No, God! Please, let me! Hey! Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great! What?! Okay, that we may be able to do. Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex. Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are. Yeah. Then, you will definitely get him back! Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on. Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him. Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up? You brought a carrot?! All right! Who's are they? Who's are they? Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you? Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear. Hey, Pheebs! What are you reading? Honey that sounds like fun. Okay. Oh, I read that in high school. Sorry I'm late, but I left late. So Pheebs, what is the book about? Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway...umm, what is this book about? Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the moors, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character. Well, honey that was pretty obvious. Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you! Joey, is what she just said umm...Oh my God. You were actually gonna... And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick? Hi! So umm, what's this book about? Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else. Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman. Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie! A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?! Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time. Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that! That was not funny! Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun! Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with? Oh my God! That's Monica!! You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!! Joey has got a secret peephole! Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them! Look! Well, what is the truth? Monica, is this true? Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? And the video camera? Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is. Thanks, Mon. Monica!!! Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. I have a date with Danny. I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan. So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch! Hi! Uh, it was very nice meeting you. Hey! Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something? Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle? Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway. Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal? Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. Oh, great! Okay, see? I told you! Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it. Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and... Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's... No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy. No-no, they're not very nice people. Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of... Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great! Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick! I'm not reading this! What?! So? Oh, good point. Happy New Year, Joey! But your divorce isn't even final yet. Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about. I don't gossip! Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip? What? They were like this! I didn’t! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. I think they're very nice. Awful, absolutely awful. "Baddest man in the whole damn town." Arghh!! Joey, do you have a minute? Oh, Joey, I have such a problem! Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something! Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone. Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable! What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they? I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone... That really is something; that's really cool. Good luck, honey! Hey, uh, Joey? Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about? I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right? Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me? Yeah! Do you know something? I might know something too. Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know. Well then I can't tell you what I know. All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! AND YOU KNOW!!! Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known? Ohhh, yeah, me too. Come on Joey!!! I can't believe you would say that! No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want...I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss? Is he romantic with her? Are they in love? You don't know anything. What? Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that. Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back. Hey! What's up?! Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you? Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything! Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships! Nothing! You go! Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if...are you sure there's just not anything else? No! If there was I wouldn't tell you. Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute. There he is! Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there! You walked around all night in the city by yourself? Yeah! No that's what I was thinking. Ross! Janice?! Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go! Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big." Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. What?! All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. Sure! Why? What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now! Hey! Hi! Well, I was actually...I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better. Yeah! Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money. That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books! Okay. 'Kay. Congratulations on your new job. Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out. Sure! God, please take those off! What? Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now? Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear? Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag. No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag. Exactly! Unisex! No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex. Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow. Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it. All right, then you owe me $350. Joey! Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy. Hi sweetie! Why?! Why not?! Okay. Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part. Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are? What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it! Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it... ...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just...it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial. I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving. Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt. Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man. Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. What?! Oh my God! OH MY GOD!!! Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW! Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!! HI!! Hi! Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it. Joey! Come here! Come here! Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler. No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window. Wh-what do you mean? Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that! Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing. You don't have any secrets! So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them? Okay. Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us? Oh. Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks! Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet? Oh. What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment? All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself! Y'know what you should do? You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear. See? Yeah, he broke those too. Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler. Are you kidding?! I can not believe he would do that to Mon...Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know? Joey! Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two! All right. Be sexy. Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross! Show time! Okay! Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here! Okay? Whoa, wait! Yeah, oh wait! Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open. Okay! Hey, what's-what's going on?! Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while. Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react. Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you. Okay. She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket! Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you? Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that. Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you. And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head. Well, because she loves you and because you love her. Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica. No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different. Not unless different means the same. Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big. Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why. Hey! Hey, cute jacket! Oh! Ow! Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! Ohh, you're so sweet! Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler? Uhh, we still need a tip. A couple of bucks. Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge. Hey Joey! Ugh! What?! You say that to kids?!! Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch. Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away! Yeah! Are you kiddin'? Oh. Oh! I can do it! Ross! Ross! Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch. Fine! We went out. Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser! Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! Yeah. Oh-oh! Any chance you think the couch looks good there? Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure? What's up Joey? Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch? Thanks! I know. What's up Joe? Yeah? What are you saying? Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up. Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends! Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait. Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. Well, I brought the next best thing. Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself. Okay! Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit. I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch! Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends? What?! Why?! Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?! Good, you guys are all here! Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow! I know! Wh-what?! Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me! Yeah. O-okay! Hi. Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing! No! Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh! All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh... Well, I didn't know what else to do! Thanks Chandler. I can't believe it! I got a second interview! What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back? I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!" Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him? Maybe. I-I don't know...Oh God, how could I be so stupid?! Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you. Hi! Thank you. What? Excuse me? Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me! Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that? Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh..... Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again. Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you. Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr... Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it. Oh! You are? Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug? Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that...I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so...Hey! I'll see you Monday! I cannot believe Ross is buying this! Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck! Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day... Okay guys, way to wish me luck! Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry. Oh, what a fun office. Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories... ...about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke. ...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me! I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit! I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson? Yeah, I can do that. I would love to! Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air. Oh great! Oh that's okay. Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time. Oh, me too. Oh, me too. Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions. Thanks! Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success. I did not! All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career! No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up. I am so on board! Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach. Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit! Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters! Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! Okay then! Hey! Hey-hey-hey!! Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters! Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about? Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down. Okay. Oh man! What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month! Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine! Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird. Oh, okay, not so weird. I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law &amp; Order! No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him. What's going on? Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people. Hm-mmm. Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. Big night! Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. Here you go. Thank you! Oh what, you-you want both of them? Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it. Tell her to wear her own earrings. Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff! Because I lose her stuff! Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary! Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!! Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women. But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing. Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me! Ohh! Thank God! Where was it? Okay that is the one we already have! What?! Yeah. Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault. It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelery box? Hey! The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. Okay, calm down, here they are. I don't know, I don't know. Oh gosh, she's going to kill me. Ohh that'd be great! Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. Your sunglasses?! Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to... I'm sorry. Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza? No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting. Yeah. I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person. Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you. Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think? Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought. Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. Yeah! I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute. Yay! Hey! Ohh, thank God! Finally! Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog. Great! Thanks! Okay. Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh? Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita? No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready. Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM? What?! Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! Hey! What's up?! So all we have is ice? Okay. Oh. Oh! I know! What?! We can't do that! Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message! I don't think he's the one who needs help. Ugh! Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! Noooooooo! No, wait. Wait. No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this! Yeah well unless we tell him. Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message. Right? Hey! Hi! Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross? What?! What? What happened?! Yeah! Really?! Because a car backfired? Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today. No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine. Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right? Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because...I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me...not important. The point is, I was right. You're decision. Okay? I was right. You're decision. Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that? Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience! Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff. I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily? Well, there you go! Close call day. Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. Oh? No. Yeah. Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right? Hey, you guys... Is Monica here? All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl. Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? Okay! Check it out! It's a, it's a cat! Yes it is! Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat! Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal. A thousand bucks. All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it! Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?! Hey. Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time. Yeah? Well, it's my cat. Oh yeah, I got a cat. You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!" Well, I was gonna let you play with it. I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! I tried! They won't take her back. Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats? No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! It's not a baby! It's a cat! Oh no! No! It's actually...it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it? Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on! Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it? Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000. Okay, a thousand. Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat. Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody? It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson. Yeah, 15 hundred dollars. Oh yeah, there you go. Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's? Phoebe, are you okay? Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast? Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long. No, I meant with the dropper over here. Well, my eye is a little itchy. Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend! Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor! Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please? Monica! Come on! Ross! Stop it! Come on! Chandler! Just stop it! Come on! All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule! Oh my God! What does that thing do? All right, I'm outta here! Hey! So were done then! Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. What?! All right. I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Okay! Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye. Great! Okay, just give me the damn drops! Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better. Damn! Bye you guys! Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss. Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose. Eh! Stop it! Okay. Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this! All right! All right. Yes! Okay. Okay, they are. Four. Really?! Okay! Great! Okay. Well, well, you said it was practice! Because I knew you were lying! What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong! Monica! Stop it! Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! Yep! What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God! Oh! Pheebs? Could you get that? Please? No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here. Sucker! Hi! Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work. Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that. That sounds great. Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night. No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time. No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked. Oh! Look what happened! Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen... naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh. Uh, yeah, if you want too. Yeah, sure? And um, what-what is that Ross? What?! Are you crazy? Oh God, you saw me?! Oh! Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?! Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes! Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry. Yes. Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?" Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love. I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done. No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times. Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily. No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are. Yeah. Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right? Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you. Hi! Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident. Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. Ahh. Hello! Ohh, kids love me. Hi! Pancho Vila? What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?! Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can...you have so crossed a line. All right, it won't come off! It won't come off! No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on. Hi!! Hi. What?! What else did he say? Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this! Ross, I am a human doodle!! Okay, I need a, I need a drink! Macadamia nut? Hm-mmm! Nope! Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel. Hit me! I bet 20. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second.
