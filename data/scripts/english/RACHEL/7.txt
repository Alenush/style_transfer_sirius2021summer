No, y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine. Hi! Well thank you, you too. Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married? Ohh... Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that? Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone. Shake it off. No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm... Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing. Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff. Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night! Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night. Yeah-yeah, we never had that, What? Oh honey, but it is just about... What?! Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw! Honey I swear it we just kissed. Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on! No! No-no, it’s really not huge. Joey, you are not! You’re 31. Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look... Hey. What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing. Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you! I care! Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed? Am I going to let you watch me undress? Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me? No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about? What?! Monica, what are you talking about? Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring! Oh!! Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago. Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder! All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen! I swear, I never wanted any part of your night! Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night? Oh wow. That...y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex! We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it. Who is it? Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you? All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?! No you don’t know why! Because! Because I was sad. Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler! Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night. Yeah. Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans! Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music... Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks... Okay. Aw. What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?! Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall! What?! Now Joey, what did the duck do?! Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing? No. Joey, did you eat my face cream? Joey, where did you learn that word? You found my book?! Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?! Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. Well what happened at dinner? Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. Do you even understand what off the rack means?! Well what?! How-how much is it?! Ohh! Really?! Ohh, you guys are so made for each other. Joey. Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha. Well no, I don’t smell anything. Nothing! Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey! Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. Who are you supposed to be? Do you even know what a vicar is? Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s...I’m not...it’s just not funny anymore! All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it! That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things. Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body! Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up! Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! Yeah, what? Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm... Yes! Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players. Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey. Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want. Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat. What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. That is the Coast Guard. Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet. Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready? Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what’s this called? Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up? No. What do you do if I say we are coming about? Time’s up, now your dead. Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?! Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time. I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything. Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey? Why not? What? I was just trying to teach you. Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets. Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher. Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson? Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom! All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling. I won’t boss you around. And, I’ll be nice. And....Joey! Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side? Right? It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one. Okay, go to the left. The left! Just sit over there!! No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling. Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? Joey, come on! We just went over this! No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do! What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit! Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit! Oh my God, wait did I...I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? Did I just say Greens don’t quit?! No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn. Really? Awww... Left. Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun. Ohh we’re not sailing. All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches! Here you go. Oh wow! Ohh, sorry. Ohh whoops. That’s nice. Well that was umm...Okay. Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine! What are you gonna do Pheebs? Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and... Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here! Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in. Joey! Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office! It’s the same story. Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail. Yeah! I got...I get a big pay raise! I get to hire my own assistant! And you were at this job for four years? Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay? I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing. No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you. All right. I’m a total pro! Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall. Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what’s...what is...what’s your name? Uh-huh, go on. That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on! Okay, hold on just a second. I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please? Chandler, you have an assistant right? No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy... I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do. Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty! Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda! Hi! Tag. What are you doing here? Kinda. Oh-ohh, thank you. Well... But I hired you! Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant! Yeah! Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home. Hi! Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes. Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant. I’m sorry Joey. Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives? Joey, why would you do that? Tag? Hi, who was that? Really? Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second? Okay. We’ll be right back. All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you... Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes? Hi! Gay? Yeah. Hi! Well yeah, sure, what’s up? Oh really?! Oh, did you not want people to know that? Why’s that? Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. ‘Kay. Yeah. Yeah, she’s gay. Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy. Hey, I thought that guy was married. Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him? Oh, I gotta get back to work. Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker. Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife. I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it. Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing! Oh, no sit-ups today Tag? Oh, well drop and give me ten more! Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in? Oh, great could you make me four copies of those? Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s up? I’m just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? No. Why? Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya? Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight. Oh yeah. All right, back to work. Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor. Hi Joey! What are you doing here? Yeah, sure. Umm...here. Yeah, I don’t think so Joe. Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight? How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay. I’m not asking you to go on a date with him! Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it. Yeah? Yeah! Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? Ohh that’s nice. Wo-women? You mean like old women? Oh. That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh? Yeah? Hi! So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night. Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey. Y’know, all the women. All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just...And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him...but it just bothers me, all right?! All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is! I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush. And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But...I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya! Yeah. Sure. So, will you talk to him? Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts. Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night? Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas? Wow!

Okay. I’d love to! Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah! Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it’s you! Me too! Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?! Hypothetically! Uh-hmm. Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea. Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that... Fine! Yeah? Really?! Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just....Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s. Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s! Why does it matter so much to you?! What-what if I marry Ross....Or Joey? Yeah but Phoebe... Okay. Okay. It’s...since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor. I’m gonna marry someone good y’know. Better than Chandler. Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor! You have been maid of honor before?!! All right that’s it! I am maid of honor! How come you are?! Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?! Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie. Okay, uh... ...it’s gonna be okay! Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts. Thanks! Thank you judges. Oh! Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony! Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre... Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey. Aw, thanks! What?! Well then I demand a recount! No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous. We’re gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads! Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! Hi Pheebs. Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby. Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours. Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case... Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there. And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. I’m just gonna grab a couple of these. Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. Yeah... You do? Why? But Pheebs, y’know you earned it. No, I was ten. I just developed early. Hey! Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. Hi! Oh, how was your date last night? Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry! What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?! Why?! What?! Are you kidding?! Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig? Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility. Hi. Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in. Hi. Would you like some pancakes? Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time! I know! Oh and I’ll call ya too! Bye! Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I... Cupid. Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch. Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere. Fine. Phoebe! I’m sorry? Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good? Yeah, there was. It was...there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read...Yes, there was. Well now what’s the rush? Well look who’s here! Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no! Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to. Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?! How did it go with Erin? Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don’t get married before I do. So how’s it goin’ with Joey? Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him. But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?! Ugh, tramp! Yeah, see ya. Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here. Hi! Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship. Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner. Joey!!! Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship. Well that too. Joey? Do you want some pancakes? All right, I got 48. How come we have one extra place setting? Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. Seriously, it's moving! Hi Tag! What are you doing here? Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend? Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? Interesting. Huh. A moo-point? Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense? You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. Hey! How are you holding up? Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. So were you guys together a long time? Now that she broke up with you? Yeah. Hmmmm. No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out. Because, uh...it has to. Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah! No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you. Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. What? Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay. Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out Hi! Hi! Oh, hi! How are you doing? Oh. Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It...y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. Really? Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. Gooood morning!! Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job! Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem. We... We are not... going to let it...be a problem. Well y’know, we did other stuff too. Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date! Anymore!! Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct? Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation. Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up? So did you read your evaluation yet? Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you! I’m thinkin’ no. Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie. Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch. Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it. Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back! Yeah? Oh my God! Joey! Ugh! Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk. Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office. Let’s roll! Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything... minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan. Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly. Well... Oh no-no-no... You’re lookin’ at it upside down...y’know what? It doesn’t matter. Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet. No, you could’ve lost your job. Thank you! You’re great! What? I... It just...it took me so long to get that desk organized. There it is. Oh my god!! You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe. Did you know he was in there? Hey! Drums? Ha! Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air. What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool? Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula. What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter? And that makes you angry because... Where did you get that? Phoebe? Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out! It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal. Oh, it's so much more fun with you. We did! Oh, I would love to! Good, good, good, good, good. Um... Done! Oh wow! Look at this place! Oh my God! Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms? And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down? Do you really not know where I’m going with this? It left! It’s one huge room! See? You can’t, because of the new skylight! So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place? Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we? Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone? Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey. Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you. I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair? Hey! Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here. Oh. I got it! Its back in cage! Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby! No. No, you can’t. Oh I don’t-I don’t know. Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie. Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone. Oh. You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable. Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan? No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them? Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get. Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today! Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy. Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk. Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch! No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office. Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work! Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got...Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever. Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right? Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there? I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please. Thank you. Hello? I still don’t get it. Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me? Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers! Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it’s not in there! How about that drawer? Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let me check. Can I see you in my office for a minute? You put these on my desk! Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! I am so hot for you right now. Hey. Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here. So that there will be a decent place for me to sit. And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this. No? I’m sorry, Rosita? As in... Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal? Stevie the TV? No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch! Joey, Joey I am so sorry. Okay, come on...Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair. But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put....your comfort first. Okay? You ready? You will like it! You don’t even know! Well look, if you don’t like this... Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette. Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process? That’s weird. It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation. Joey, I really don’t.... Well no. No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something! That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself! Hey, how’s...how’s the uh, miracle chair? Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest! Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio! Hey Chandler! How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest? Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment? I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair... Yeah. Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed! Noo! Angels. What? Wh-hey! Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs! No Joe, no miracle. Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back! No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere. The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half! We’re the Cobras! Ahhhh!. Uh-huh. Hey! Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it. Good ones? Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29? Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam. Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this? Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty. There you go! Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty! Nothing. I don’t want to do anything. Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again. Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something. So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch!! Get out, get out of my apartment. Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming! What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed! Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey. Ahh! A scooter! No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That’s funny, yeah! No, I know! I get it! It’s funny! No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids. Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids... As I was saying.... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan! So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant. No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years...Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty. No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry! I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk. Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs. Ross, I really don’t think… Hey Joey, can I… Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag. Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother. Not in the street!! Hi. Hey. Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk. Umm… Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t… Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun. Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25! Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger. Yeah, I’m sorry. Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year? Ohh... Yeah, it’s just y’know... Oh! I would love to read a poem. It’ll be a short one. Ohhh... Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain? She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage. Oh! Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress. Well, I'd have to say gay. Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy. Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight. All right, straight, and not subtle. Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found. What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story? Phoebe, you had a date three days ago. Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone. Yeah! And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again. Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone? Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!! No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone. I don’t think so. All right, first name on the speed dial is mom. Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. Yes okay. Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! That’s a steak house! Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial. His new girlfriend! Hi Pheebs! How are ya? Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone? And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up? And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! You stole the phone! No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring? Phoebe! Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It’s for me! Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It’s Rach... Would you stop doing that?! Phoebe! You can’t do th.... You do know that I will be here when he comes over. You just said it! Oh Phoebe! Ohh! Hey! Hey! Well why shouldn’t I?! Well, then I get to give him the cell phone. You’re not the man who left the cell phone. Is-is he coming? We’ll be right back sir. I don’t know! I know! What?! No-no they do but, you just have to wait. All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big! Ohh... Hi. Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan! MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! God. You seem really, really nice. I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people. Okay. You are so beautiful. I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks. No! Hi! Hi Ben! Oh, yeah go ahead. No. No. Ben, it's Rachel! But whatever. Awww, just like his daddy. What-what about Monica? So it would just be me alone? Huh umm… Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him? Okay. Yeah I think so. Bye. Ahhh… So this is fun, huh? Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink? Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke? Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? Water it is. Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend. No, I’m not. Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay? Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff. Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other. Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal. Yeah? You like that one? I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face. Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay? Coming. Uh-oh. Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… Oh that. Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?! Yes. Hi! Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?" Okay. I’d love that. I would loooove… So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little... I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay? Yes oh——Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday? Don’t do that. Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks. Oh damnit! No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that! No don’t! Go back to repeating! Oh crap! So now what have we agreed? And-and what else? Very good. I’m just visiting my good friend Carol. Yeah! Carol…Lesbian? What line? All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already! Okay, maybe they are not funny to you… Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?! That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!" Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want! Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway! I gotta go! Hey! Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben? Ohh, okay. Wh—Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it. I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. You’ve got something here on your back. Oh I… No! Wait! Come on! No you guys… EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! Oh my God! You look so beautiful! I do the same thing. I’m just kidding too. I’m getting married in December. Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced. So, does this come in another color or… So this is Brooklyn. Okay. Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!! Well I… No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy! No! You gotta hold my hand!! Hey… You’re out of Diet Coke. You’re out of toilet paper! Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced. Well, what is the other reason? Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid. Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is! Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that! Will all the stars be there? Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous! No!! You are getting married! This is all I have. I’m fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award! What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle. Yeah. Grammy, Best New Artist. Ohh that’s great! So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win. Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation. Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably start practicing your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed, but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… Y’know? Oh no, at the Grammies I always win. Whoa what? Really? Not right now. Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love. Yeah. I didn’t. I got under him. I know! My God! Do you have your speech? Do you got your gracious loser face? Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me! On TV?! Yeah! Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?! Oh my God, you stole her award! Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means. Joey, you have got to take this back! No! Joey! Do you really want an award you didn’t win? Joey, it says Best Supporting Actress! Joey, no: this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real, and that one is gonna mean something. All right? Thank you. Thank you. I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley! Okay, I’m totally cool! Hey Jess. ‘Sup? Absolutely. I’ll be out in a second. Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00. Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go. Hi! Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second? Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least! Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?! She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday… Yesterday! Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it! Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right. Phoebe, I already, I already did. Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it? 4 o’clock. Food? Ooh great! Very Monica. Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons? We’re paying for this y’know. Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme? What? Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list. Hey! What’s up Mon? Have at it. Are you makin’ him a sandwich? We have to get her a present?! Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse? Yeah? Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice. Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica? Ohhhh! That’s great! Excuse us for a minute. You didn’t tell her to come?! No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was supposed to bring the cake! Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake! Oh Monica, we are so sorry. Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either. Ugh… What do you, what do you mean? Surprise… …Monica. Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next? Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this. Melissa! Wh——Why don’t I tell you over here? Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren! I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear! Oh please… No. Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um… Shut up. Oh, wow thanks! Oh you’re in real estate! Wow! What do you do now? Okay! Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college. She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close. Yes. It’s not a big deal! No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit. Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren’t for playing are they? Hey! Stop picturing it!! That is not a problem. Oh, get out of here! So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me! Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back. Some of them. Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!? Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw. This one is uh Paul O’Neil. He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan! Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. It’s a pretty cool tux. Hey! So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one? Well, what are you going to wear? Huh. Does Monica know about this? Can I please be there when you tell her? Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl. Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version? Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit. It-it did! Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?! I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened! Vanilla?! I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas! All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you. Oh. Oh, that’s great! Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out. Remember?! We—come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops… …we went back to the house and we got really silly and we…we made out. How can you not remember us kissing?! Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together? Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me. No!! Thank you Phoebe. It happened! I am telling you it happened! What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! What? Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser! I’m sorry! Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna… What the hell was that?! And? Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome! Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome. I don’t want to say. Diane Keaton. Monica what? What is the emergency?! Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress. Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more." Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. Hey! Hey, what have you guys been up to? I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years. I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us. Arghh!! What?! Oh my God! OH MY GOD!!! Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW! Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming!! HI!! Hi! Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. Are you kidding?! I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know? Joey! Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two! Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open. Okay! You really think it would be that different? Well, things change. Hey, who's this little naked guy? Aww, look at the little thing. Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is. Oh, can we read them? Okay. Monica, will-will you marry me?
