Oh, you're welcome a million. Oh my God. Whoa! What?! Why?! Here?! Now?! Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood? Whoa-ho. I don't know. Oh, making it worse! Oh, was it awful? I wrote you a letter. It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done. Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up? You just finished? So umm, does it? Does it? What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it... Are you sure? I know. How was the beach? Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does? All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there? Oh-hooo, I missed you. Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater. Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective... Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! What?!! You fell asleep?! Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!! Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me! And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep. Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants? I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy. Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this? Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh. Why? I love that thing. Something to do with numbers? What? You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?! Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews? Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me! Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch! I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?! Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school. They had to have that specially made?! Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot! Oh, you go out with him. Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? I believe it. Yes, I do. Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. Jurassic Park could happen. You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar? You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?! Do we have to tell her? I hate when Ross is right! Pheebs... All right!! Jeez! Hello, Chip. I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself. She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch? Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs. So, how was your date? Um-hmm. Oh honey, I'm sorry. Ohh! That's so great! I'm sorry, sweetie. You could.... say you're sorry to her mom. So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl? I'll go with you. Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game. Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice? My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward. You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you? What is she doing here? I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’ Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now! Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it. Thank you. That’s weird, she locked the door. Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list? What?! You promised you would break up with her! And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?! Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them. Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again! You never come into this office again! You give me back my Walkman! Well, then I lost it. You buy me one! Does it hurt? Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna? When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired! No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why. What if I clean your bathroom for a month? Foot rubs for a month! I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums! Sophie sit!! No! God, would you just calm down! I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts. I ah Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning! Yeah!! D’oh!! I’ve got it! I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know. Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy. I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle. Ohh, not compared to you. So did you break up with Joanna? What?! It’s me! Good morning! Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I Oh my word! Oh, yeah! Yeah! Okay. What? Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full. Well, I thought you liked doing it. Right! Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger. Ummm. Oh! I`m sorry. It`s a little old but.... I`m sorry. I didn`t, I don`t come in here a lot. No. I didn`t. I never said that. Okay, I`m sorry. Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. That`s easy for you to say, you weren`t almost just killed. Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet? Oh! My hero! What happened? What?! You got us evicted!! That`s not true! Go!! Well, why doesn`t he practice with a girl? Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that garbage chute. Hey! So, did you quit? Oh, umm, I was just y`know working out and umm, Oh, that`s it. Where?! What was that? You just did a little dancy thing. You are soooo enjoying this. Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes. What are you ever gonna use that for?! You got fired?! Sweety... Yeah? May fifth, why? Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her. Well, have fun! Yeah, she's... You love her. Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross. Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64. Okay. I'll miss you. I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum. Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom? What was that? Oh. Stop it! Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh! I think he's stealing from me. Because he's stealing from me! Ughh! Well where's Amanda? I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out. Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian. Ohh, that is soo sad. Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! Sorry. Y'know... Yeah. No! Okay. Okay. Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what? Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek. Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that? Oh, honey, that's so sweet. Oh my God! What happened? Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice. And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love." No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help. Hey, how'd it go? You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one? No.... Yes! Rent! What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. What did you get her? Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? Any luck? All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. Aw, honey, that's so sweet. Oh! Pathetic! I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug! Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me! Thanks! Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go? Yeah, I mean, you should play in public! Oh, I can`t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers. Why not? Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him. Yeah, Phoebe you`re awful! I know, I remember that! Well, Chandler, you`re gonna have to tell him. Because you do. Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves. What? So are things with you and Joey any better? Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh? You shouldn't. Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy. I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just... People are trying to sleep in here! Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor. Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye. I know, it's sick. Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner! Is he okay in there? So now, what exactly is the point of the box? Why? Okay. Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time. Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of? Credit. Ooh, I like those sunglasses.  Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope! Sick-sick-sick-sick. Ross, can you pass me the yams? Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?! Okay, fine. Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter! Joey, had reasons. What?! Oh, he sees her! No? Oh! Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss. Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and.... God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying. And that's I'm so glad there's no problem. Ohh! That's great! Really?! Well, I, umm... Thank you. Well, they uh, they-they do more than that. Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me. I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that. Yes, I realize that. I love working with designers! Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview. No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you. There's nobody here! Do you want me to quit? Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day! What? My drinking? Said what? Exactly. Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person! Say more things like that. I'd need an expense account. And an assistant. Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer? Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy! Ohh, you've waited soo long. Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya. How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's? Yes!!! Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls! I'm an assistant buyer!! Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already? Heard what? Oh my God! How?! Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God. Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened. Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us nothing about an assistant buyer? Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna. Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang! before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great. Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung. Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before? Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs. Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa! Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them? Pheebs, that's great! But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle. Oh yeah! Really?! So, will I like any of these guys? Chandler! Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies! Op, I like credit cards! Well, so what does he do? Your company has a fine foods division? Chandler!! You have the best taste in men! Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious. Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right? You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that! Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea. Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship? You idiot!! You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away! Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people! Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! Really? No. Cute guys in little shorts? Sure. Well that sounds fun too. What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?! Well you said *black*. Why would he want his blue blazer black? Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something? Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about. Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper. Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom. I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you? Chandler, that is so nice. Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that? Yeah. Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave. Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree like that. Let me see that. Oh yeah. Well, you know, sometimes that helps. Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn. Oh, TOES!! Yeah, for some people. Oh. Oh, I can't watch this. It's like "Sophie's Choice." Oh, it was only okay. Depends who asked. Oh, Mon. Sure. Yes. You're not asking me, are you? Yes, totally. What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh! BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!! What is that noise? Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster. Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around. What? I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop. How many guesses do you get? No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!! Okay, well, we won that one. Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions. Fine! We'll ask Phoebe. I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing. Tails! We'll take Literature!! Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing! It's All Relative!! I'm sorry! Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars. Monica?! Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money! Oooohh that's interesting. Throw in the duck too! Well, he gets the other one all riled up. Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this. Why? Do you have the answers written on there? All right, let's do it. Okay. All right! 14? Space cowboy! Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers. He carries a briefcase. Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce, transpondster! Oh my God. Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here! Well I-I-I'm not moving. No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game! Noooo. What?! I don't care, I'm not going anywhere. No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. That's right! You do what the hand says! How did it go? Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean! That is not true. She did! She forced me! Well it stupid, unfair question! Will you stop calling it your apartment! No it's not! Oh, I think I saw some in here. I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die. Bloomingdale's eliminated my department. No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down! Uh-huh. Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you. Hi! Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua? Oh, I'm so sorry. Well, at least that's a great suit. Okay. No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry. Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way. I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day! Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh. Hi-e!! Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there. It's Joshua. Why? Honey, what is the big deal? Yeah, that's true. Chandler, what did she say? Beefsteak Charlie's? Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that? Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. Hi! So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating! Really? It doesn't seem desperate? Hmm-mmm. Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before. No. Have you? I don't even know how I would go about it. You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we, the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times? Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no. Really?! You think that will work? Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too, Umm, who likes the Knicks. Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great! Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it? Great. Sure. Yeah-eah-ha! Oh well, you don't want to do that now?! Okay. Basketball! I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week. Really? I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket. He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it! Wow! Monica! Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone. Really? Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'? How does going to a strip club help him better? Um-hmm. There we go. There it is. Yeah! Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about well uh, this one is large. And this one Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up! Yes. Sure. You got it. Great! Me, Fladermouse, great. I really... So? Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back! Oh. No! Nothing! Yeah! That would be great! Well, I-I guess,I... Yeah, great, you betcha! What? Oh. Oh, right. Oh yay! Hey! Hey, Monica! Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So. What are you gonna do? No! Help me! Phoebe? Ugh! Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is, I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back? Ohh! Hi! So. Ohhhh, come on!!! No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please! I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me? Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily? I'm Rachel Green. There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So, Oh well, no I, I'll get her. Hey, whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow! Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face. The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep. No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in. No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me. Honey, that's you're name. What? Who the hell is Emily, noooo!! They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?! How, how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! I don't get this! She was horrible! I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont! Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every, little, thing!! Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont! I can't believe it! He still hasn't called. It's Joshua. No, I don't. Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there? See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal. Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh! Well, are we all together? Like in a group? Oh, hey! What? Oh, hmm. Joshua. Yeah, I... Oh, thank goodness! Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you. No, happy for you! No-no-no, that' not Joshua. Chandler, there's a guy right over there. Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off. Hmm. Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does? Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it? Guess who we ran into today?! You are not. You have never been able to break up with her. Hey! Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light. It's coming from Joey! Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know. Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him. You are not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened? No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse. What are these? Okay, okay, okay should I be scared? Wow! If only more people knew. Hey! What-what are-what are these? Oh my God! Look at this! I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head! And did you?! Oh my God. Hello, Mrs. Chatracus. Thank God. Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal. What am I making him by the way? I thought I was making him filet mignon? Wow, I really get crabby when I cook. Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in! Hmmm! Oh I know, my God, this is so, this rice is so, I am so good. Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over. Yeah, sure, okay. Okay. All gone! So, farm birds, huh? Oh. Okay. So, can I serve you a little of, What? What? What? But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here. Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment. Your parents’? Ohh. Yeah that works. Wow! This place is fabulous! Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet. Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out? That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up? Ah. Hi you! I know, I can do more than cook. Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. Hello. Hello. What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not, that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so. And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, "USA not ready." Yes! Well, we were going to do that after, I mean umm, next. Oh, yeah, well, Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house. Yes. Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out. No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. So? Huh. She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on. Absolutely! Absolutely! What, yeah, what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian. HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday! I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy! Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small. Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Hey! So. Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves? Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me. Yeah. Do you guys want these? Ohh, well you got ‘em. Just give us our apartment back! Oh, come on! We know what these are worth. You’re bachelor pad?! Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua. All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets? Let me finish. I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all. Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty. What? Shut up! We’re winning! Okay. All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again. Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high! We took our apartment back!! All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer. Let us keep the apartment and.... Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back? Yeah. Yeah, I-I heard. I think it’s great! Ohh, I’m so happy for you! Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! Oh! It’s you. Hi. Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so.... Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay. Yeah. Oh, that’s sweet. Uhh, hang in there? I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua? Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically... I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua. You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like, it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes. Oh yeah? Fine. Oh yeah, no, what’s that? That would be great! Hang in there. You hang in there. No, just singing. Hi! Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway! Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s. Why not? Nothing. In a month? You mean, you mean 30 days? From now? Well, that’s great. Hi! Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you. Yeah! Sit! I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why? ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know? Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I, that I think we need, we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough! Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively. I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married? Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think? Well, I just called Joshua... Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married. I’m just going through a hard time. Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue. Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well. And I-I am just trying to figure out why. Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again. Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three. Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there. Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me. Well, apparently he scares easy. It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would. Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily? Yeah. Yeah! I got my girls. Ugh. What? Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood. Oh, okay! I’m not gonna marry Chandler! Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo. Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it. Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! Hi, sure! I knew. I did. Yeah, maybe... Really? Oh Ross, you're so great. OK. Ohhh!!!! Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it! All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it! Yes! Did you see that? I could not have done this without you. What? Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. Good. Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that... Well neither do I! Oh my God. Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard. I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. No. A break from us. Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! Just get out! Now!! Okay! All right! How was she? Was she good? Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she? Good different? ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."   Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective... You seem to really like her. Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks. Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. Yeah. Hey guys! What’s up? What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation? Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really,I’m-I’m happy. I’ll work on it. Yeah. Oh, honey, I don’t know. I.... No, I’ll think about it. Yeah. Who's this from? Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered. It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! What did you just say? Oh.... my God. Oh my God. Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? She didn't hang up either... Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat ......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . Ohhhhhhhh God. Ohh, ohh. Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. Really? Oh, god. Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK. Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! Noo. Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. I just, I feel, I-I just... Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! Oh my God. Oh. I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late. Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s, Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour. I know. Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
