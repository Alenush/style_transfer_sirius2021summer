I know, I'm her!
ooh...
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
Oh... okay, just hide!
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
There's no room under the bed.
Yeah...
Hi...
...I really don't...
Yeah, sure...
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
You would think!
Joey!
How are you doing this?
How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Sure...
Get out!
Are they right?
Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
Although...
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
No...
Yeah...
Forgotten.
Nothing...
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
Still nervous?
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
So hi!
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Oh! That's great!
Oh, so everything's okay?
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Really? Excited?
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
What? What is it?
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Hi!
Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
Goo--ood night!
Seriously, good night!
Okay.
We weren't doing anything!
Shhh.
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Ross? Can we just close the door?
Ross, say something. Anything.
No, no, no!
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
No, but you know what I mean.
Calm ourselves?
Well, what would we be doing?
Feel me up?
Hey.
Oh, you bet.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
No awareness.
Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Ooy.
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
Ross, you don't seem okay.
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
So.
I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!
Ok, so sorry.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Ok, let’s work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
Okay.
Oh!
Ow!
Well this is romantic!
It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
oooh! Oh oh!
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Hey! Got champagne?
Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
You like that? Let's take this into high gear
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
What is the matter with us?
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Right, totally.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Hmmm... Me too...
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Aah... I bet you're right.
Yeah.
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
We're having a party.
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
I said it's still nap time.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
Oh, she's still napping
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Oh! Emma might like what?
What did you get her?
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
Oh, ok, which one?
Wow! That was amazing!
Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Is that it?
Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.
Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
OOH! God! Sorry!
Emma's awake.
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
What?
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Well, I'm very impressed.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
What?
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
NO, no science camp!
Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Yeah.
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Of course, I'd be honored!
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
So now, what are you doing here?
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Oh, I know, isn't she?
All right. What's your news, Amy?
What? Oh my God! To who?
A-And??
No, what's he like?
Yeah.
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
Ok.
Ok, let’s keep talking.
Amy, hi!
Oh, good for you!
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’
Joey, I can’t do that!
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.
Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Well, what happened?
Oh, that is so tacky.
Phoebe, that’s huge!
I think it could be kind of great!
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Menstrual cramps.
Can any of you watch Emma?
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Well, actually...
Yeah.
Why not?
Wha... the next one?
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
Absolutely.
Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
Yeah!
You pierced her ears!?
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Ugh.
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Nothing.
Oh, they're real!
I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Oh yeah? Since when?
What?
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
You put holes in my baby's ears!
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Excuse me?
Joey, where are those bags?
Seriously?
Hips or thighs?
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Oh, I can give you that.
Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Did you just say Emma?
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
That's shocking!
Hi!
My God!
Mmh-mmh!
Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Oh!
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Hi!
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Who's Gladys?
Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
No, I couldn't let you do that.
But I don't want you to.
But I insist harder!
No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
Did you watch the tape?
But you are a liar.
Well, this is going well.
Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
O-oh my God!
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Joey, we're not keeping this!
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
Yes I can!
She's yours!
She's yours!
She's mine!
She's mine!
I want Gladys!
She's mine!
She's mine!
Excellent!
Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
Oh, don't be such a baby!
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Absolutely.
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Oh my God, what!?
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
All right!
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Ok, careful.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
I know but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
Ok.
Ok.
Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Alright fine. I'll do it.
If you hold a spider.
IF you hold a spider.
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Ok...
Ok... O-k...
Ok...
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
A-alright! I can do this.
That's because he's on your neck.
ROSS!
Hi!
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
It's not? When was she born?
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Did you at least win the contest?
Can't wait!
Yeah.
Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Really?
You heard them say that?
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
No, what?
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Because I already did!
No...
What are you doing here!
And I won!
Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
Yeah. That's me!
She won a thousand dollars!
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
Oh!
So bad.
Dessert?
Congratulatioooons!
Ewww, is that what that is?
Yeah! I'll cook!
Hey!
I lent them to Ross.
I'm so happy for you!
Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Do you think I'm someone else?
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Hi!
Oh!
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Hi
what?
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Ah, this place is great!
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
My God, get a room!
Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
No, you gotta pick one!
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
He's not having an affair!
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
"Dude, Where's My Car?"
They're in a caaar...
Geez!
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Oh, look at her, so happy!
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Who's Nancy?
Are you serious?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
Yeah it is.
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
You're fly is open, Geller!
Ow, that had to hurt!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Oooohh that’s interesting.
14?
Space cowboy!
Ow...Oh Gosh!
Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
And a crappy New Year.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
Aah! Why? What are these for?
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Oh, d'you like it?
What?
Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Uh! The police!
Yeah?
All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
It... You can so totally tell.
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Bitchin'
Oh.
I am sooo drunk.
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Oh, what a line.
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
Yeah okay.
No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
So maybe something in an office.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Uh... November?
Hey Pheebs...
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
Goody, what is it!
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Happy wedding day!
Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
What d'you want?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Hi
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
All right fine, I pick you.
Oh my...
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Who's there?
Uh.
You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Since when do you watch the news?
Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
How was the honeymoon?
Oh!
I did not know you spoke French.
Oh... you're so sexy!
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Ross...
My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney’s.
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Ok. If you really need to.
Oh, I really could.
Ohh...
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
Can somebody please go in?
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
Hi!
Uh. Did you call your parents?
Oh good.
What?
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Yeah.
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
What?
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
Ok, maybe you're right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Wow. Ok.
Mhm-mh!
Sure.
Hmm-hmm.
Yep.
FYI..
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Oh stop that!
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
What?
Oh, good.
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Not even one more time?
No matter how much we want it.
That's what we decided.
...It's kinda hard though!
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
...Ross?
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Hi you guys.
Ooh, Italian!
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Congratulations!
Ooh!
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
Sssshhhh!
Hi... I'm on a date...
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
Oh.
Yes, hi!
Hi! Excuse us.
Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
What? I-I don't.
No, I-I-I love it there.
Oh! It's not good.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Oh!
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Oh, thank you...
Well, now I don't have to.
Ross, what is taking you so long?
Mark? Oh my God!
I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Great! I'll call ya!
Oh my God!
Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Yes.
Oh.
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Ugh.
Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
Hi you guys!
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
He offered me one.
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
The job is in Paris.
Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Oh, that sounds good!
It's all done!
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
It should be right next to my plane ticket.
What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
I'm gonna miss you so much.
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Oh, oh. . What is this?
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
I love you Phoebe.
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Ok. Monica?
Can you come here with me for a minute?
Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
I... I... I...
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Oh honey...
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Okay. Oh...
Oh!
Oh... Well...
I think I'm gonna take off.
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
What?
Ross...
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
What?
WHAT?
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
What?!
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Ah.
I know!
Morning!
Hey.
Good. You?
Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
You too. Last night was just wonderful.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Hi!
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Yeah?
Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
Oh... Bye guys.
Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Oh my God!
Hi! Oh my gosh!
Oh.
What... What...
Aw..
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
I will. Ross, come here.
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Oh.
Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Hello?
Yeah.
Phoebe? Is everything okay?
What? Why?
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
Well...
Wait, what are you doing?
Could I get some peanuts?
This is ridiculous! I...
Yeah, okay.
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Yeah?
What?
Oh my God.
I - I have to get on the plane.
Yes, I do.
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
I got off the plane.
I do love you.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
Okay, should we get some coffee?

He offered me one. The job is in Paris. Oh, God! Please, somebody say something. I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want. Thank you! Thank you! I think it is. I got a really incredible job offer. It's in Paris. Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board. Joey, it would mean so... Joey... Hi. Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her. Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back! Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. No, I'm still going. When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great? Hi! You are never going to believe what happened to me today. Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money. Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in. Well, I took it. Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice... Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. What? You really think so? But I already told Zelner that I would come back... All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris. Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross! Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
