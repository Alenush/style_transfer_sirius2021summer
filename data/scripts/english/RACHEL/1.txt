Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! Hi, sure! Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!! I'm all better now. Please, no, go, that'd be fine! Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.. Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference! Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life. Hello, Paul. So, like, you guys all have jobs? Wow! Would I have seen you in anything? I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. Oh, yeah. Oh wow. Are you in trouble. Oh, look, wish me luck! I'm gonna go get one of those job things. Guess what? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today. You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off! They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots! Uh, credit card. Um... my... father. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Thank you. I don't think so. You gonna crash on the couch? Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What? Sorry- No, you have it, really, I don't want it- Okay. I knew. I did. Yeah, maybe... Goodnight. Would anybody like more coffee? I'm just serving it. What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? Since when? And everybody knows this? Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! Good for me! Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! Chandler, what are you doing? This Alan again? How's it goin'? Well, then can we meet him? What bank is this? And did you notice...? What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. It's worse than the thumb! Well, I-I could live without it. "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. God, he's good. Yeah. I think he's across the hall. Uh, Joey.. We didn't change.. I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family- Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." Look look look look look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally- -not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that. Oh my God! What are you guys doing here? LESLIE) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it! So what's going on with you? So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! Okay. What? Guys, I'm not. I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job- Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies. What's that? Okay. Oh, God, ask them what they want. But I haven't used my card in weeks! They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay? Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister! Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what? ...Jack from downstairs? Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like- Yeah. Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down. Thank God. Food. No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese. Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus? Hello? Who are we spying on? Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him! Yeah. Oh please, they're having sex. So, whaddya think George is like? How long? Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl. I was laughing! You made me laugh! He is so cute! Oh, okay. Will you take my place? Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. I've got magic beans. Never-never mind. Ohhh... I'm fine. Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting! God. I feel violated. Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it! What is it? Tah-daaah! Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for. Well, whaddya think? I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table. Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout. ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what? Who is being loud? Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment? Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell. Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here? Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner? Everybody. Shh, shhh. Err, Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not. Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio. Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome. Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. So, um, did she... Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. Oh, you-you mean your earrings? Hm-m. Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy. Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! Oh, well you know who I love the most? You! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Hey, who's this little naked guy? Aww, look at the little thing. Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job. Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that. Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips? Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go. Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go. Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. Oh my god, oh, you guys are great. Thank you. Thank you so much! Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? Oh my god. Saw what? I got the tickets!

I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park. We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys. Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys." No, no, no, you said, "got the keys". Oh, I gotta get my ticket! All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not. No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys. Aside from the fact that you said you had them? Well, you should have. Because! Because! Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys. What? By all means. And a crappy New Year. Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. Phoebe, you're on. Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh! Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much? Yeah! Okay, here we go... There. Now there is. Five. Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who. Rome. Jerk missed his flight. No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip? Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. The bll is drrbing! I can't kiss anyone. ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth. Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! No way, forget it. Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool! Oh, hi sweetie. Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time. Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer. Hey. What're you guys doing out here? Well,sounds like you two have issues. Goodbye, baby. Hey. Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'? Hey. Okay. I am so hot! Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay. Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo! Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'. Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist... Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it! Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend. I know... I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally... Pheebs! Oh, right, that's me! "Ooo", what? Hi Pheebs! No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's. Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over. Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs... Why have I never tasted these before? All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. I guess you don't. I need some milk. No...oh!, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed! Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened! I don't know...right, he's the pig! Oh, God, he's such a pig, He's like a big disgusting... ...pig...pig man! Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this? Ok, Ok, Pheebs... Oh, God... No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better... Hey. Ooh, I've been better... Oh, Ross... I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't' want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. Oh Ross, you're so great! Oh... ...medium...hmm...any cookies left? No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. What? Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy. Oh, yeah, I've done that. I've never done that. Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along? So, is this just gonna be you and Carol? Well, isn't that gonna be weird? Oh, cool. "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel". Well someone was supposed to write "Rache, take down the lights" and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there? So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday? Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn? Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work. You don't even have cats. We'll try to keep it down. Are you seein' her again tonight? It's just occurring to you? Oh, you're gonna be great! Oh, how'd she take it? Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible? Please, they've been going out a week.

You know with Paulo, that all there was, was heat. I, I mean it was just this raw, animal, sexual... Ah. I mean, do you think you can ever have both?

Come on Louisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here. Take it! Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart? You know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit! Oh Ross, come on. No, no, it was my fault. I almost lost your... Sure. That'll be good. Barry? ! Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him. Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

What does she mean? She could be you. What? You just click when they click. Nope. We took her to lunch. No way. No way did you do this. Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh, somebody will. Where the hell've you been? Are you drunk?! Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... Monica? Monica! Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work? Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you! Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. What? Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the 'plane. No. Shut up! All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were... Well, you were pretty damnedy good. Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. Get off. What are you playing with? Off to see young Ethan? Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh. Could tonight be the Night? So, did you shave your legs? Aha! No, forget it. All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too. No. No, it was just the three of us. He, he, he. You know what? There were times when it wasn't even me. Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? Ethan called again. I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. Where are you going? Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom? True story. Let's dry 'em again. Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross. Ross? You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... What? What? I don't know where the phone is. Ross? What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. Rossy, Rossy. Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction. What, it's ok when Chandler does it? Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips. And if you need anything else, I--do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm uh Rachel Green. I'm Carol's ex-husband's sister's roommate. Oh, that's funny! Hey.
