Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner? Um, Mon, Chandler's not here. Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma. Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going. She is? What about Monica. I just don't think I can bear it. Umm. Oh, ah... You need to learn some new slang. Wait ... Oh! I was just going to say that I left my keys. No! Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something...knock that door down! What if she jumped out the basinet? Oh my God, I left the water running. Ah, did I leave the stove on? Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there. Huh? Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true. Oh, God, Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again. We got locked out of the apartment, we ... It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do. Oh honey, this is for the best, this way I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up! She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you. Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have? Yeah, I'll have the soup and the salmon. You guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon? Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock. No, no, Emma dropped her sock. Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground. Could you please get her attention? Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration. What? Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home? So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her. That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us? Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you. Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny. What, the blonde with no bra? Okay... Sandy, that's exactly what it is... Ross! Oh! Oh, that's pretty. Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed. Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him... So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. Why? Yes? Please? YES! Sandy you're hired. Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here. Oh... Oh boy... Hi... Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc√©e and it was just sooo beautiful. I can't... I can't hear it again. Yeah! Excuse me... Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all. What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby? Sandy made Madeleines. Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. Okay, what? What is too sensitive? That was kind of rude! You know, he was just doing his job... Oh, come on Ross... Oh... That's true. Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. YOU! You feel! Oh, damn you Geller! Huh ha ha! Oh yeah, she can't be herself. Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with Uh, he took the SAT's for me. Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean... Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing Hi. I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. You WHAT? And I missed it?

I like big butts and I cannot lie, you Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work. Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a That's right! Oh, it's a Macy's bag! Oh. "Dear losers, Wiper blades. I don't even have a car. Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!? I'm the hell person whose office this is! Excuse me? Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job? A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw. Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. Excuse me? Can you please, please take care of it for me? Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job? That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp. Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department? Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue? Oh, hi Mr. Zelner. That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to? Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power. Today. No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening. Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me. Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today? Come on, I don't know what else to do. Ross? You're pretty. Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to? Hey, they were popular when I left! Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed? Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up! Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this? Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in! Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything! Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon. What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour. Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him! No, I can't, I have a baby. Why would you do that? That's really nice. Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you. Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me. Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside. OK, thank you. Oh, wow, Molly is just great! What? You really think she's hot? And Joey? Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? Thank you! So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. Hello. Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology. Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ... No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you. Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished. I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out! Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep. Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate. That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship. It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses. Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh! Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her. Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away. Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you. If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror? Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now. Hi! Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle. Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother. Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy! I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake? Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit! Shh! I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see. God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me. What? Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over. Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her? Yeah, sure! Oh, give me! Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party? Are you comparing my daughter to a rat? whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats? Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up? Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over. Mmm hmm. No. Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ... Oh, you bought me a present! Why? Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin" Awww, awww, it's beautiful. See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time? Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me. You do? See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ... Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid. No not that. I kissed Gavin last night. Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and... You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf... You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf! I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all... Who is it? Why? Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick Oh no no no So did I It's just a cold What? What's the matter? Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny. Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain! Oh! Molly! You're not Ross. Right, right, yes! What? No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly. OK. I thought it was Ross. There isn't. There is totally isn't. All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in Yes People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin So seriously...rodeo clown? Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I‚Äôve been looking for you everywhere! Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o‚Äô clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a Who? You‚Äôve being seeing someone? Hi, and I am also Emma‚Äôs mother. Wow. She does that a lot! What, what, wait a minute! You haven‚Äôt even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like Ok, Ross, what‚Äôs going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now? How do you know about that? Oh, that‚Äôs what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me? Score. Oh God, I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time! Yeah. Oh yeah. What? Who? Whoa, how do you know about that? Why didn‚Äôt I get that message? From the guy in the bar, why didn‚Äôt I get that message? Ross? Why? Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get? Yes. Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What‚Äôs wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know, Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while? Thank you. Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning. Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma. Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so... Bye! Hey! You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight. Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. Why? What's the big deal? What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set. So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay? Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun! Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken. Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you. What? Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive. Really? What's that like? Really? Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you! This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep? I don't care! This guy is a nightmare! He's not stoned. Yeah, four times. No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry. Don't touch my coat! Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello? Oh my god, this is the worst date ever! No. What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she? Well, uh... Really, really not. All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve. I just had a rough night. Eww! Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but... Yeah. Oh. Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left? Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up. Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this. Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show. Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. You got it! Your agent called. You got that audition. Yes. Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it‚Ä¶ You saw that? Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. Oh, anything yet? Joey, that was formula. Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. Hi you guys! Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment. No. I was just going to do this myself. Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this? Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig? Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself! There is a hardware store right down the street? This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. Hi! Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks. Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. Don't look at me I never get his jokes. Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder. I don't know! I mean, what brought that on? No you really think that's what it is? Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time! Argh. fascist Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too! Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!? Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job? Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys. I'm so sorry Pheebs. Hey! How was basketball? Oh, no! Who did that? She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it? Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him! All right... Oh, Emma loves him! : Step away from the crib, I have a weapon! What are you doing? Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom. Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore. Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's. Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail... Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it? Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy. Yeah, I think she wants the old one back. Joey, come on! I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy? Original. Then what's that big lump under your covers? That's not Monica! Oh God. Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey! Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much. Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever . Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack! Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child? Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut? Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker. Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying. Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there! She dropped off a casserole? What's going on? Well, there's two spots left right? Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands. You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win? Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai" I don't really care about the Knicks. You would do that? I never get picked! I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word. Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes. Ooh, I have another idea! Well, well, well, look what mommy found!! Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends? Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong? All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us! OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets ! Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets. Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work. No, she was just much better at job than me! You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down. Hi mum, put her back on! Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!! She said "gleba"!! Isn't that amazing? Why-why aren't you more excited? Oh, but of course it is! I don't know all the words. Ok... "Emma just said gleba"! Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up . Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi. You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win. What? So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3? Me too. I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less. Woow! I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog! Are you serious? Hey, that was an honest mistake! Yeah, that was an awesome day! Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? Oh, please! Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm... OH MY GOD! Is that Christian Sanders? He's so gorgeous! Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"! Ok, not that you need it but good... GOD! Is that Chase Lassiter? He's straight, right? Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry, good luck! OH! SSSHHHHTTT!!! He's asking her a question!!! NO! Or, cut! You know, that's your call! Hi! Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing! God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. Oh screw her, that part is mine! Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here. Kiss me. Kiss me. No, I'm saying... just... don't talk... Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new! Can I ask you a question? Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? Ok, well this is like that... in no way. I had a... I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey. Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense. I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday. Olivia. So do you think that my dream means anything? Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream... You took the same class twice. Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... Ok, we're still on that. Hey! Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? How... how... ? uh-huh Wow... definitely just Drake... What... how is it going with Drake? What... that scene I saw was so good! Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? So? Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Ok... this could be a little awkward... I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey, you never.. you never talked about that before... Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry. Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question? Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal? No reason. Yeah Nobody, forget it! Maybe. Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said. Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time! Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet. I know them from work. No, one of them... I don't know, what were the names I just said? All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? Hey! Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... You are having a party tonight?? And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that? You do that every year?? Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?? And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant? OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory? Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties? Well, then so you just invite me...! Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please... OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system! Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play. I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!! ... Ok, who is this? Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease! Sure! Oh... What? Yes, I am! When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is! Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you! And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!! Ok professor or detective? Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory! Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number. Nice to meet you. Ok Yeah! Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler! I always loved that!! Come on! I think this is funny! Just some boys gave me their phone numbers. I think I am. Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey, you're so sweet. Who ? What? Really? Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! Oh, Very funny... Joey. Hey! I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Please, what about you and Chandler? Well hello !

Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something. That's not what we're gonna do! Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping? Not gonna find any clothes in there! Hi. Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya? I'm there! Bye, see ya. Pheebs, that's for men! On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here. Really? Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them. Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies! Sure! You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff. She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her! I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance! Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom... Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him. It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous! Oh, I get it! I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal. So can we keep this between us? Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me! Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard! Ok, great! Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying! Well, get back in there and talk! What!? Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too! Oh! What are we gonna do? Oh my God! Alright! Enough out of you! Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard. Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going? Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been? Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world! Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain. Yeah. Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho! Yeah... I try... No, that's David. Tip of the iceberg. Do you have anything that would... get us out of them? Hey! Hey what's going on? Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed! Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy. Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler. What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season. It's not the time Charlie. You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer. Ugh. Well, I've brought some books. We could read. We can't. We're not pharmacists! Kate Miller? And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend. Thank you. I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home. Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts... No. No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain. No. Joey! Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen. Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is? Do ya? Later! La... Ok. See you, bye. Open your drapes! Open your drapes! Nooo! Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous! Homo. All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach? It was really... great! Oh! Oh! Weather bitch! It's open! Hi, Joe! What, is everything ok? Nooooo, why? Oh, that's crazy! ... yeah, it's true. What, hey! W-What are you, what are you talking about? Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl... Yeah, I'm not talking about her... You know? Forget it! No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So! Yeah, sure! Ok, let's not make a big thing about this! Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will! Only like a month! What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little! Shoot! I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?... Who...? Oh yes, of course, I remember him! Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about! But can it... just... happen a little bit? But why, why not? But that wasn't gonna stop you before! I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything! It's not a big deal! It's so not a big deal! Ok! Ok, I... AAAHHHH! What?
