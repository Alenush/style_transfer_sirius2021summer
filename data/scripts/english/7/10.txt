НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Haaaa, ahhhh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Skull?
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god!
ФИБИ: No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Licorice?
РОСС: Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! That's great!
МОНИКА: Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
РОСС: Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
ФИБИ: And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
РОСС: Hmm.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you know he was in there?
МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How long have we been home?
МОНИКА: About a half an hour.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lovely!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not?
МОНИКА: Bing's weird.
ФИБИ: Oh, hey, you guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
МОНИКА: Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
ФИБИ: Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
ФИБИ: Yeah, why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
ФИБИ: Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No reason, except she told me.
ФИБИ: Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No, she didn't say that. III think you should talk to Monica now.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
ФИБИ: You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
МОНИКА: Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
ФИБИ: Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, Your mom probably won't kill herself, y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on Probably! Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Drums?
ДЖОУИ: No! Drums!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
МОНИКА: I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
НЕДРУГ: Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this because of the burrito thing?
МОНИКА: You need to give him money.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Give him money? It was a joke!
МОНИКА: No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
МОНИКА: You've got to be smooth about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
НЕДРУГ: Of course, sir.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: How did it go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Had the money in the wrong hand.
РОСС: Woooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
НЕДРУГ: No.
РОСС: Well, I do, so let's. So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
НЕДРУГ: Christmas.
РОСС: Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
НЕДРУГ: Christmas eve.
РОСС: Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
НЕДРУГ: Santa has reindeers that can fly!
РОСС: Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
НЕДРУГ: Jingle bells, jingle bells.
РОСС: Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
НЕДРУГ: Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
РОСС: Okay, it's not a contest.
НЕДРУГ: When is Santa coming?
РОСС: Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
НЕДРУГ: No Santa? Was I bad?
РОСС: No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
НЕДРУГ: Santa's mad at me.
РОСС: No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
НЕДРУГ: So Santa's coming?
РОСС: Yes! Santa's coming!
МОНИКА: It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you know so much about this?
МОНИКА: I don't know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Richard used to do it, didn't he?
МОНИКА: We'd be eating our soup right now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mustached bastard.
МОНИКА: Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me.
НЕДРУГ: Good evening.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh-hahaha!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ha!
ФИБИ: So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four.
НЕДРУГ: Tequila!
ФИБИ: That's fun.
НЕДРУГ: Here you go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
МОНИКА: It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye! I mean, it is so annoying.
ФИБИ: Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
ФИБИ: Maybe on some level.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
ДЖОУИ: What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
ФИБИ: Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
ДЖОУИ: Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
ФИБИ: It's a tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
ДЖОУИ: Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
ФИБИ: Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
ФИБИ: Our apartment is ready.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And that makes you angry because.
ФИБИ: Because you would rather live here with Joey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where did you get that?
ФИБИ: Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Hm?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
ФИБИ: Fish!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates that's the deal.
ФИБИ: Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
ФИБИ: We did have fun, didn't we?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We did!
ФИБИ: Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I would love to!
ФИБИ: Yay, okay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good, good, good, good, good.
ФИБИ: Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um. Done!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
РОСС: No, these are my pants.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
РОСС: Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
НЕДРУГ: Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
РОСС: Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I uh, you gotta have something.
РОСС: I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
МОНИКА: What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
РОСС: Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
МОНИКА: Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from. Texas.
НЕДРУГ: Texas?
РОСС: That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Thanks!
РОСС: You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
НЕДРУГ: Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm partJewish.
РОСС: You are? Me, too!
МОНИКА: Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
РОСС: You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
НЕДРУГ: Cool!
РОСС: Yeah!
МОНИКА: Come on Ben.
РОСС: Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
НЕДРУГ: Santa!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: What are you doing here, Santa?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man?
РОСС: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your partJewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
МОНИКА: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
РОСС: What are you doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
РОСС: Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
РОСС: Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
РОСС: I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine, I'll give the suit back.
МОНИКА: Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Santa? Really?
МОНИКА: Yes, is that okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then it's okay!
РОСС: Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
НЕДРУГ: No! Why does he have to go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because, if Santa and the Holiday. Armadillo? are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
НЕДРУГ: No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
РОСС: Fine, II give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
НЕДРУГ: Okay, Santa!
РОСС: All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
ДЖОУИ: Merry Christmas!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow! Look at this place!
ФИБИ: Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore. Ooh! New sconces!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you really not know where I’m going with this? It left! It’s one huge room!
ФИБИ: Oh no! Oh! Wow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See?
ФИБИ: Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You can’t, because of the new skylight!
ФИБИ: There’s a skylight?! Wow!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
ФИБИ: Y’know I’mI’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
ФИБИ: A little bit, yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
ФИБИ: You heard her too?! You have the gift!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.
ФИБИ: Are you sure?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.
ФИБИ: Oh me too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
ФИБИ: No, I do not hear that.
РОСС: and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for.
НЕДРУГ: Eight whole days.
РОСС: That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
НЕДРУГ: Awesome!
РОСС: Yeah?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
РОСС: The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
РОСС: Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ФИБИ: Oh.
ФИБИ: Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got it!
ДЖОУИ: Is it back in the cage?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its back in cage!
ДЖОУИ: Cage closed?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
