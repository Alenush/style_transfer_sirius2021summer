РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Those are all the things Im responsible for!
МОНИКА: I had to go with the odds Rach.

НЕДРУГ: Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
ДЖОУИ: No. Nope, I uhI thI thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Yknow? Hes uh, hes a face toucher.
НЕДРУГ: I dont think so. Lets take it back to Richards last line. Action!
НЕДРУГ: We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
МОНИКА: Honey, we gotta go!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Heres a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
МОНИКА: I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, include more people in this.
МОНИКА: Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow well be getting married?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you dont have to sound so surprised.
МОНИКА: Im sorry butnothing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: Wellhonestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honestly? Me too.
МОНИКА: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and Ill go allChandler. But nothing has.

НЕДРУГ: Nora!
НЕДРУГ: Charles.
МОНИКА: It-its so great to see you both here.
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Arent you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
НЕДРУГ: Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: of course you can kick his ass son.
НЕДРУГ: You could kick anyones ass you want to.
РОСС: Thanks you guys.
МОНИКА: Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would you talk to Chandlers dad and try to keep him away from Chandlers mom?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! But I dont know what he looks like!
МОНИКА: He is the man in the black dress.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Man in the black dress Hi! Im Rachel! Im a friend of Monica and Chandlers!
НЕДРУГ: Im Amanda.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I get it! Amanduh!
РОСС: Can I have everyones attention please? Im uh Im Ross Geller.
НЕДРУГ: Doctor Ross Geller.
РОСС: Daddad, please! As I was saying umm, Im Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and Im the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, shes the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if youd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple were here to celebrate. To the Bings.
НЕДРУГ: To the Bings!
МОНИКА: All right, Im gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ill do it.
МОНИКА: Who wants it? Anybody?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I said Ill do it!
МОНИКА: Nobody wants to do it? All right, Ill do it myself.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica! Im not gonna screw it up!
МОНИКА: Yknow what? Youre right, Im sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well of course that is what Im here for!
МОНИКА: Okay. Sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! What grandmother?
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Where have you been?
РОСС: Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
РОСС: What? Are you going back to work?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РОСС: Nice shades.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I wont get spit in the eyes, yknow?
РОСС: And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
ДЖОУИ: Great! All right. Ill see you later.
РОСС: Hey, wheres Chandler?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I think hes in Rachels room. See ya.
РОСС: Chandler? Chandler?
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Is uh, is Monica here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shes steaming her dress, why? Whats up?
РОСС: I think Chandlers gone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: He left that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tell Monica Im sorry.
ФИБИ: Whats up? Tell Monica Im sorry. Tell her yourself!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.
ФИБИ: Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.
РОСС: I think it means he freaked out and left!
ФИБИ: Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Phoebe, II think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
РОСС: LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Okay but if you dont find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
РОСС: I will, I will find him.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
НЕДРУГ: Just the last two pages.
ДЖОУИ: Alright.
НЕДРУГ: I found the picture!
ДЖОУИ: Picture? What picture?
НЕДРУГ: Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
ДЖОУИ: Okay uh, look I know youre a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks.
ДЖОУИ: But youre spittin all over me man!
НЕДРУГ: Well of course I am!
ДЖОУИ: You know youve been spitting on me?!
НЕДРУГ: Thats what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Didnt know that.
НЕДРУГ: Great!
ДЖОУИ: Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?

РОСС: Well then, well-well see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-whatwhat you guys doing here?!
НЕДРУГ: Well, you kids talk about this place so much, we thought wed see what all the fuss is about.
НЕДРУГ: I certainly see why the girls like coming here.
РОСС: Why?!
НЕДРУГ: The sexy blonde behind the counter.
РОСС: Gunther?!
НЕДРУГ: Your mother just added him to her list.
РОСС: What? Your-your list?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, the list thatof people were allowed to sleep.
РОСС: Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know Im looking for him?
НЕДРУГ: And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know Im looking for her.
НЕДРУГ: Action!
НЕДРУГ: I found the picture!
ДЖОУИ: What picture?!
НЕДРУГ: The picture of my wife! In your pack!
ДЖОУИ: You went through my personal property?
НЕДРУГ: Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
ДЖОУИ: Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
НЕДРУГ: Cut! Wonderful!
ДЖОУИ: Great scene yeah?
НЕДРУГ: Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks a lot.
НЕДРУГ: Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ImIm not working tomorrow.
НЕДРУГ: You are now.
ДЖОУИ: No! No! I cant! You gotta get me out of it! Ive got plans! Important plans!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross said theres still no word from Chandler.
ФИБИ: Oh man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
ФИБИ: Okay. Well theres one down.
МОНИКА: Im getting married today! I think I just cracked a rib. But I dont care because todays my wedding day! My day is finally here!
ФИБИ: Yknow she might not even notice hes gone.
МОНИКА: Im gonna start getting ready!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God! DontWe cant let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait shell be in the gown and then he wont show up and then shes gonna have to take off the gown.
ФИБИ: Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You cant do this here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Im sorry. Im sorry. Its justIts just so sad!
ФИБИ: Yeah, but youve got to pull yourself together! Monica cant see you like this! Then shell know somethings wrong!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I know. Oh God. Theres no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
ФИБИ: Yeah. Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicas bathroom right?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ФИБИ: No-no! III found one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
ФИБИ: Sure. Do you need some floss?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God I just cannot imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesnt show up!
ФИБИ: Oh heres a whole bunch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, Oh that poor girl. Yknow? Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant. So I guess she wont be totally alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: I know! Monicas gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
ФИБИ: Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And Im still holding this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
ФИБИ: Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay?
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Why?
ФИБИ: Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anything?
РОСС: No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. III talked to Chandlers parents again!
ФИБИ: You told them he was missing?
РОСС: No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, weve got to tell her hes gone.
РОСС: No! Hey! Hey! We cant!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, shes gonna start getting ready soon!
РОСС: Well, cant you at least stall her a little? IllIll go back to some of the places I went last night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, well how much time do you need?
РОСС: Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: One hour.
РОСС: Give me two.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Then why do you ask?!
РОСС: Okay, wish me luck.
ФИБИ: Okay. Im going with you.
РОСС: Why?!
ФИБИ: Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, Ill see you guys later.
ФИБИ: Okay. Wait, do you know how youre going to stall her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ill figure something out.
ФИБИ: All right. Good luck.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks.
МОНИКА: Hey! Okay, so I thought wed start with my make up and then do my hair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay uh, but before you do that. II, I need you to talk to me.
МОНИКА: About what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm Im never gonna getting married!
МОНИКА: Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Monica! Im serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
МОНИКА: Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
МОНИКА: Rachel! You okay?
ДЖОУИ: Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasnt supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. Its my best friends, and Im officiating so I really cant work past four.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We cant stop filming just for you. Its not like its your wedding.
ДЖОУИ: Im having surgery!
НЕДРУГ: What?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, II just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didnt want you to worry about me. But, Im having surgery today.
НЕДРУГ: What kind of surgery?!
ДЖОУИ: Transplant.
НЕДРУГ: But youre supposed to work on Monday.
ДЖОУИ: Hair transplant.
НЕДРУГ: But youre not bald.
ДЖОУИ: Its not on my head.
НЕДРУГ: Look Joey, theres nothing I can do. Besides, youre probably gonna be out by four anyway. Weve just got one short scene. Its just you and Richard, and God knows hes a pro. Youll be fine. Morning Richard.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Youre here! Great! Great! Great! Lets get going buddy, weve got a scene to shoot!
НЕДРУГ: Im wearing two belts.
ДЖОУИ: Are you drunk?
НЕДРУГ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Yes you are!
НЕДРУГ: All right.
РОСС: We are never gonna find him! Hes one guy in a huge city!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Is that him?
РОСС: That is an old, Chinese woman!
ФИБИ: He could be in disguise, yknow.
РОСС: Aw, yknowYknow, maybe were-were just approaching this all wrong. If youre Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think youd go?
РОСС: So this is your office?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym!
ФИБИ: What the hell are you doing?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Im related to Monica. How is she?
РОСС: Shes fine. She doesnt know youre gone. And she doesnt have to know, okay? Now come on, were going home.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! No! I cant do that!
ФИБИ: Why not?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cant be the Bings!
РОСС: Whats wrong with being the Bings?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
РОСС: Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No.
РОСС: Then you are neither of your parents!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And Ive met me I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
ФИБИ: But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too huge.
РОСС: Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well yeah, but then.
РОСС: YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Depends on what you mean by we.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And thats every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again.
МОНИКА: The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel Im sorry! I have to start getting ready! Im getting married today!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. At dusk. Thats such a hard time for me.
МОНИКА: Im gonna go put my make-up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. But wait!
МОНИКА: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Lets go to lunch.
МОНИКА: I cant go to lunch!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good God! Ive fallen down!
МОНИКА: Whats going on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Alright. Honey listen. When I tell you what Im about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
МОНИКА: Okay, youre-youre really freaking me out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We cant find Chandlers vest. We cant find Chandlers vest.
МОНИКА: How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
ФИБИ: Found the vest! I mean were gonna have to keep an eye on it, yknow make sure we dont lose it again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
МОНИКА: Oh wow! Okay. Dont scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, Oh my God! The worst has happened!
ДЖОУИ: I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
НЕДРУГ: That can be arranged.
НЕДРУГ: Lets reset.
ДЖОУИ: What?! He got me! Owww!

НЕДРУГ: Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
ФИБИ: So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
НЕДРУГ: Here comes the bride.
ФИБИ: Oh my God Monica!
МОНИКА: I wanna wear this everyday.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
ДЖОУИ: I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
ДЖОУИ: No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
РОСС: There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasnt so scary, was it?

РОСС: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, excuse me for a minute.
РОСС: WhHeyWhoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
РОСС: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh fresh air!
ФИБИ: Wait! Maybe, maybe youre overreacting! You do that yknow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, yknow. I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.
ФИБИ: Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding, excellent! Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
НЕДРУГ: I dont know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Yeah. Theyretheyre-theyre my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
РОСС: Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: I thought he was with you.
РОСС: He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.
НЕДРУГ: You cant ask us son, thats cheating.
РОСС: Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
НЕДРУГ: Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.
НЕДРУГ: As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
НЕДРУГ: But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.
НЕДРУГ: Honey, it isnt good luck.
РОСС: Oh my God! Monica!
МОНИКА: I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?
РОСС: Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.
МОНИКА: Are you okay?
РОСС: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: Well, youre-youre sweating.
РОСС: These-these are beads of joy.
МОНИКА: Oh thats sweet. Dont touch me.
РОСС: Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
ФИБИ: Yeah!
ФИБИ: Whats going on?
РОСС: Chandlers gone again!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
ДЖОУИ: Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guys hammered!
НЕДРУГ: Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting.
НЕДРУГ: You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
ДЖОУИ: So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day.
НЕДРУГ: Well have we finished the scene?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
НЕДРУГ: As were you.
ДЖОУИ: So I got your car, its right outside.
НЕДРУГ: Why? Are we done for the day?
ДЖОУИ: Thats what you told me.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you. Youre welcome.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
НЕДРУГ: Is that my ass?
РОСС: There he is!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ФИБИ: Hey! Oh!
РОСС: Youre not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross!
РОСС: HiiiiYa! Im serious! Youre not walking out on my sister!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats right! Im not!
РОСС: Then where the hell have you been?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know about Monica.
ФИБИ: You know?!
РОСС: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
РОСС: What?! What?! Talking about what?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You dont know?
РОСС: Know whatIf somebody doesnt tell me whats going on right now.
ФИБИ: What? Youll hi-ya?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monicas pregnant.
РОСС: Oh my God. Oh my God! And youre-youreyoure not freaking out?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes.
НЕДРУГ: Cigarettes?!
ФИБИ: Well you obviously didnt see Chucky 3.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so shed know I was okay.
РОСС: Dude.
НЕДРУГ: Way to go son! I knew youd find him!
НЕДРУГ: Our little boy is getting married.
НЕДРУГ: Oh look at you! So handsome!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. Im so glad you're here.
НЕДРУГ: Are you Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you Joey?
РОСС: Huh. This is nice.
ФИБИ: What?
РОСС: Ive never walked down the aisle knowing it cant end in divorce.
НЕДРУГ: Oh I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.
МОНИКА: Shes right there.
НЕДРУГ: Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
НЕДРУГ: I love you sweetheart.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look beautiful. Is this new?
МОНИКА: Not now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Who is this?
НЕДРУГ: I am Father Kalebasous.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hes Greek Orthodox.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: As are you.
НЕДРУГ: Let us begin. Dearly beloved.
ДЖОУИ: Thats my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, Im sorry Im a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you wont be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, lets get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. Ive known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as Ive left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
МОНИКА: He took off?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go on! Go on.
МОНИКА: Chandler, for so long II wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And instead, I found everything that Id ever been looking for my whole life. And nowhere we arewith our future before usand I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you dont want to. You go!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, thats okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way, its okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if Im sure?
ДЖОУИ: You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do.
МОНИКА: I do.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah you do!
РОСС: Rings?
ДЖОУИ: Aw crap! Okayuhuh lets-lets do the rings.
ДЖОУИ: We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you. And I know about the baby.
МОНИКА: What baby?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our baby.
МОНИКА: We have a baby?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
МОНИКА: I didnt take a pregnancy test.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thenwho did?
ФИБИ: Oh and theyre gonna have a baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
