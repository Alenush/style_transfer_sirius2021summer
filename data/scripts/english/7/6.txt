МОНИКА: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it’s you! 
ФИБИ: I hope it’s you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me too! 
МОНИКА: First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?! 
МОНИКА: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine.... 
ФИБИ: Yes!!! Oh!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hypothetically! 
ФИБИ: Still. 
МОНИКА: If Phoebe were my maid of honor.... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-hmm. 
МОНИКА: Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours? 
МОНИКА: Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide! 
ФИБИ: Wh-why is that the best part? 
МОНИКА: Because then I don’t have to! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that... 
МОНИКА: I’m really not deciding! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine! 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, I-I couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying Chandler Bing? 
МОНИКА: Yeah that’s right. 
НЕДРУГ: Huh, good luck! 
ФИБИ: Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Die Hard's still great! 
ДЖОУИ: Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’d you rent? 
ДЖОУИ: Die Hard 2. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2! 
РОСС: Joey, we just saw it! 
ДЖОУИ: And? 
РОСС: And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Die Hard!!!!!! 
РОСС: Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. 
РОСС: Well, John McClane had plans! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch. 
ДЖОУИ: What are you talking about? Bitch. 
ФИБИ: Hey Rachel? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
ФИБИ: Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! 
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just....Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s. 
ФИБИ: Oh! Well, if that’s what you want... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s! 
ФИБИ: But why does it even matter?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why does it matter so much to you?! 
ФИБИ: Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what if I marry Ross....Or Joey? 
ФИБИ: You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but Phoebe... 
ФИБИ: And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. It’s...since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor. 
ФИБИ: Oh, thank you so much! Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m gonna marry someone good y’know. 
ФИБИ: Oh I know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Better than Chandler. 
РОСС: What happened?!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I don’t know!! 
РОСС: We fell asleep! That is all. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go. 
РОСС: I think that would be best. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later. 
РОСС: Okay. But not about this! 
ДЖОУИ: No! Never! Never! Bye. 
РОСС: No touch! No touch! 
МОНИКА: Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s sweet. 
МОНИКА: No, it’s more like a good luck. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh, what did this woman look like? 
МОНИКА: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror? 
МОНИКА: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album. 
МОНИКА: What are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, let’s see... Okay uh, is that her? 
МОНИКА: Oh my God yes! Who is she? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend. 
МОНИКА: Did you break up with her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her. 
МОНИКА: Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow.... 
МОНИКА: Fat?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..." 
МОНИКА: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad? 
МОНИКА: Well, apparently she does. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! What’s going on? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You have been maid of honor before?!! 
ФИБИ: See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right that’s it! I am maid of honor! 
ФИБИ: Na-uh, I am! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How come you are?! 
ФИБИ: Because I cared enough to lie! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations. 
ФИБИ: What are you talking about? 
ДЖОУИ: Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part. 
ФИБИ: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges. 
ФИБИ: Well, it’s better than us deciding. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?! 
ФИБИ: No! Coins hate me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie. 
ФИБИ: Hey there, you handsome thing. 
РОСС: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi. 
РОСС: Just uh, brought back your videos. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before. 
РОСС: No! No we don’t! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! 
РОСС: I... I don’t know what you are talking about. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had! 
РОСС: I’ve had better. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! When?! 
РОСС: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh! 
РОСС: I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: I want to do it again. 
РОСС: We can’t do it again. 
ДЖОУИ: Why not? 
РОСС: Because it’s weird! 
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Do you want something to drink? 
РОСС: Sure, what do you got? 
ДЖОУИ: Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. 
МОНИКА: Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you figure out what I’m doing? 
МОНИКА: You’re Lewis Posin. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who? 
МОНИКА: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?! 
МОНИКА: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago. 
МОНИКА: No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest. 
РОСС: No, 10 is the highest. 
ДЖОУИ: Why is 10 the highest? 
РОСС: Because it’s the highest. Okay, Rachel you’re up first. Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t want to marry Chandler! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, uh... 
ДЖОУИ: I’ve got cold feet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...it’s gonna be okay! 
ДЖОУИ: No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts. 
ДЖОУИ: Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks! 
РОСС: Yes, very nice Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you judges. 
ФИБИ: Ugh, what a kiss ass. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, Phoebe... 
ФИБИ: Yes! Your honor? 
ДЖОУИ: We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go! 
РОСС: When Monica was a little girl, I remember that......Ooh!! Ow! Very good! 
ФИБИ: Oh! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Excellent! Perfect score! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony! 
ФИБИ: Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?! 
РОСС: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre... 
РОСС: Go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh! That’s nice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow. Good speech. 
РОСС: Yeah, it really was! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw, thanks! 
РОСС: Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next although I really don’t see the point. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. 
ДЖОУИ: And she’s back in the game. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me. 
НЕДРУГ: Hello Skidmark. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later. 
МОНИКА: It’s pretty clear. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s why you broke up with me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You-you-you didn’t know that. Well, I guess my work here is done! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel...Damnit! 
ФИБИ: Really?! I won! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then I demand a recount! 
РОСС: Actually, it wasn’t that close. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous. We’re gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads! 
ФИБИ: The coins have finally forgiven me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! 
ФИБИ: Rach, it’s gonna be okay! You guys are the best! 
ДЖОУИ: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. 
РОСС: Why-why would I care about that? 
ДЖОУИ: No reason, I’m just saying that uh... That’s where I’ll be. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do. 
МОНИКА: Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I would really love it if could do both. 
МОНИКА: All right, I...I have to ask. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
МОНИКА: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A hundred and forty-five pounds. 
МОНИКА: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15! 
МОНИКА: Well... That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different. 
МОНИКА: How? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back! 
МОНИКА: What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. 
МОНИКА: Keep going. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you. 
МОНИКА: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’d carry you around in my pocket. 
МОНИКА: I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby. 
ФИБИ: That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours. 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case... 
ФИБИ: Oh that’s so sweet thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there. 
ФИБИ: Ohh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. I’m just gonna grab a couple of these. 
ФИБИ: This stuff is great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. Yeah... 
ФИБИ: Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You do? Why? 
ФИБИ: Because I think it means more to you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Pheebs, y’know you earned it. 
ФИБИ: It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I was ten. I just developed early. 
ФИБИ: Man alive! 
МОНИКА: Hey, what’s going on? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, wow! That’s great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. 
ДЖОУИ: Great nap. 
РОСС: It really was. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! 
РОСС: Excuse me.
