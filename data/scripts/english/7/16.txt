РОСС: Hi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Hi Ben! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
РОСС: Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah go ahead. 
РОСС: Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No. 
РОСС: Okay! All clear! 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks Phoebe! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ben, it's Rachel! But whatever. 
РОСС: Everything okay in there? 
НЕДРУГ: Don’t talk to me now! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awww, just like his daddy. 
РОСС: Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what about Monica? 
РОСС: Oh, she isn’t home. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So it would just be me alone? 
РОСС: Well, Ben would be there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh umm… 
РОСС: What’s the matter? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone. 
РОСС: Rach, he’s not an ex-con. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him? 
РОСС: I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
РОСС: Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I think so. 
РОСС: I wasn’t talking to you. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll be okay. 
РОСС: Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour. 
НЕДРУГ: Bye dad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye. Ahhh… So this is fun, huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Not really. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m not allowed to have soda. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? 
НЕДРУГ: What’s a virgin? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Water it is. 
МОНИКА: What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean the spitter? 
МОНИКА: Come on! It wasn’t that bad! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil. 
МОНИКА: All right, what about the third guy? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest? 
МОНИКА: Can you blame him? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say "I do," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!" 
МОНИКА: Well then we still have a problem. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: With what? 
МОНИКА: Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies. 
ФИБИ: Oo! You should have one of us do it! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married. 
ФИБИ: No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff! 
МОНИКА: Are you serious? 
ФИБИ: Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal! 
ДЖОУИ: I call it!! 
ФИБИ: What?! No! It was my idea! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us. 
ДЖОУИ: Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend. 
НЕДРУГ: But you’re not anymore! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I’m not. 
НЕДРУГ: ‘Cause you guys were on a break. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay? 
НЕДРУГ: When’s my daddy coming back? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff. 
НЕДРУГ: Sharing is good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? Like how? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s a good one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? You like that one? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you’re funny. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face. 
НЕДРУГ: Can I do it to you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay? 
ДЖОУИ: So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together. 
МОНИКА: We’re never gonna find anybody. 
ДЖОУИ: Well then let me do it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe… 
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people. 
МОНИКА: Joey look it’s really sweet… 
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man! 
МОНИКА: That is true. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else. 
МОНИКА: It might be kinda cool. 
ДЖОУИ: So I can do it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah you can do it. 
ДЖОУИ: All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Hey Pheebs, how’s it going? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache! 
МОНИКА: Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something? 
ФИБИ: Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering! 
МОНИКА: Here, take a couple of these. 
ФИБИ: What is it? 
МОНИКА: It’s Hexadrin. 
ФИБИ: Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. 
МОНИКА: Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down——gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet. 
ФИБИ: Oh. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! My head! Oh! Oh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Coming. 
РОСС: I have a bone to pick with you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-oh. 
РОСС: Yes! Ben learned a little trick. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… 
РОСС: That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh that. 
РОСС: Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?! 
РОСС: I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
ФИБИ: It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called? 
МОНИКА: Hexadrin. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story! 
МОНИКА: No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff. 
ФИБИ: Say what? 
МОНИКА: Y’know, the possible side effects. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons! 
ФИБИ: Why? 
МОНИКА: In case it happens. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: You did it! You got ordained?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our minister… 
ФИБИ: I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, your liver is right here. 
ФИБИ: Okay, then I must be disoriented. 
ДЖОУИ: Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Should we call the spitter? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: What a nice surprise! What are you doing here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?" 
НЕДРУГ: Can I ask what—Come on in. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’d love that. I would loooove… So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little... 
НЕДРУГ: Gotcha!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay? 
НЕДРУГ: Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes oh——Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday? 
НЕДРУГ: Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t do that. 
НЕДРУГ: Don’t do that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks. 
НЕДРУГ: Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh damnit! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh damnit! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that! 
НЕДРУГ: Damnit! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No don’t! Go back to repeating! 
НЕДРУГ: Damnit! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh crap! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh crap! 
ФИБИ: I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling? 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby! 
ФИБИ: Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. O-okay. 
ДЖОУИ: "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. 
МОНИКА: How about receiving? 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us! 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, not us… Us! 
ДЖОУИ: I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything? 
ФИБИ: Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes? 
МОНИКА: It doesn’t say that! 
ФИБИ: Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, "Began their beautiful journey…" 
МОНИКА: There you go! 
ДЖОУИ: "…by doin’ it." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Isn’t that what happened with you and the bridesmaid? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!! I call that London style. 
МОНИКА: No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought that I was Ross’s mom. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. 
МОНИКА: And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much… 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah baby! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But then later that night… 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah baby! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I was… I wasn't exactly expecting company after… 9:15. 
МОНИКА: Is Joey here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya? 
МОНИКА: Wouldn’t you be? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight! 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out? 
МОНИКА: Well, not anymore. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But we don’t do that. 
МОНИКА: I know, I just thought it would be fun. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How drunk are you? 
МОНИКА: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s the perfect amount! 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
МОНИКА: Y’know what’s weird? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: This doesn’t feel weird! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. 
МОНИКА: You’re a really good kisser. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers? 
МОНИКА: Hm-hmm! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
МОНИКА: Wow! You are really fast! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you. 
МОНИКА: We’re gonna see each other naked. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yep! 
МОНИКА: Do you wanna do it at the same time? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Count of three? 
МОНИКА: One! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Two! 
МОНИКА: Two! 
НЕДРУГ: Three! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. 
МОНИКА: Eh, we weren’t that close anyway! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, dude I’m so sorry! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! No! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bridesmaid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They’re in my bag over there. 
ДЖОУИ: Ah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, could you leave me one? 
ДЖОУИ: For just you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I-I-I’m fine. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me. 
МОНИКА: Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh… Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who did you originally want to hook up with? 
МОНИКА: Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah baby! No baby! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this? 
МОНИКА: No, because it-it didn’t seem important. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bridesmaid you’d be marrying him not me! 
МОНИКА: Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with! 
ДЖОУИ: And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv— 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up. 
МОНИКА: Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay? 
ДЖОУИ: What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk. 
МОНИКА: Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. 
ДЖОУИ: This is crazy. 
ФИБИ: I know! Robin is so gay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So now what have we agreed? 
НЕДРУГ: No more pranks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And-and what else? 
НЕДРУГ: That you and daddy were not on a break. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Very good. 
РОСС: Rachel! What are you doing here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m just visiting my good friend Carol. 
РОСС: Your good friend? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
РОСС: What’s her last name? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Carol…Lesbian? 
РОСС: Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What line? 
РОСС: Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don’t you ever wash your face?" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already! 
РОСС: Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Ross! 
РОСС: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: What’s not funny? 
РОСС: Practical jokes. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh I…I think they’re funny. 
РОСС: You have a line down your face. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, maybe they are not funny to you… 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?! 
РОСС: Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!" 
РОСС: I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want! 
РОСС: No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway! 
НЕДРУГ: Crap!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I gotta go! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you! 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, come on nothing even happened! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding… 
ДЖОУИ: No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I accept that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s what you should say. 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? I can do it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’d love it if you would do it. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But those are the words! Those exact words! 
ДЖОУИ: Well I don’t know if I remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving. 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben? 
РОСС: Okay, I’ll see you later pal. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, okay. Wh—Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. You’ve got something here on your back. 
РОСС: What? That’s great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I… 
НЕДРУГ: What did we just finish talking about Ben?! 
РОСС: All right, that’s it! Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Wait! Come on! 
РОСС: Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No you guys… 
РОСС: I-I-am— 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey-hey. 
ДЖОУИ: So are guys doing okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important. 
МОНИКА: Yeah baby! 
ФИБИ: I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up. 
МОНИКА: Honey! Dinner’s ready! 
НЕДРУГ: What’s my little chef got for me tonight? 
МОНИКА: Your favorite! 
ДЖОУИ: Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese! 
МОНИКА: Yep! And lot’s of it! 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay. 
МОНИКА: Okay, in we go. 
НЕДРУГ: Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin’? 
ДЖОУИ: Here you go. 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief! 
ДЖОУИ: Good for you! 
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria...Oh.
