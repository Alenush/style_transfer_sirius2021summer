ДЖОУИ: Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent…
ФИБИ: Oh my God! I’m sorry, too soon. You go.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
МОНИКА: Joey!
ФИБИ: Good for you!
МОНИКА: Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy!
ДЖОУИ: No-no.
МОНИКА: Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
ДЖОУИ: No! I’m up for a Soapie!
МОНИКА: Honey? Is that something you’re making up?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh my God! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
ДЖОУИ: Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
ДЖОУИ: Many are scheduled to appear.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!
МОНИКА: Okay, I’ll go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! You are getting married! This is all I have.
РОСС: …and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
НЕДРУГ: What kinda noise?
РОСС: Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
НЕДРУГ: But like how?
РОСС: Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
НЕДРУГ: Yes sir.
РОСС: Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid II had to fail you.
НЕДРУГ: Why?!
РОСС: Well you need 60 to pass…
НЕДРУГ: What’d I get?
РОСС: Seven.
НЕДРУГ: That’s not so good.
РОСС: No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?
НЕДРУГ: Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I’m sort of in love.
РОСС: Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.
НЕДРУГ: I’m in love with you.
РОСС: Well that brings me in the loop a little.
НЕДРУГ: You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having a hard time concentrating. When you’re up there and you’re teaching and your face gets all serious…you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater…
РОСС: Okay! Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
МОНИКА: Really? My God, he’s really cute.
ФИБИ: Go for it.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, I’m engaged!
ФИБИ: I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
МОНИКА: Well you should be embarrassed.
НЕДРУГ: I thought you knew I was looking at you.
ФИБИ: I did, but that was really fun.
ДЖОУИ: And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: What award are you practicing for?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Grammy, Best New Artist.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today, and I also get to present an award.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh that’s great!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.
ДЖОУИ: What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. No-no II know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably start practicing your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed, but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like…
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know?
ДЖОУИ: You practice losing the Grammies too?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
ДЖОУИ: Ah.
ФИБИ: Oh hey!
МОНИКА: Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?
ФИБИ: Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
МОНИКА: Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.
ФИБИ: All I could think of was y’know, Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?
МОНИКА: And did he?
ФИБИ: I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
МОНИКА: Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
ФИБИ: I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
МОНИКА: Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
ФИБИ: You sound like a guy.
МОНИКА: No, a guy would be saying, I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else. Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.
ФИБИ: You’ll have a last kiss.
РОСС: Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
ДЖОУИ: Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
РОСС: There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa what?
ДЖОУИ: Ross has a boyfriend.
РОСС: I doI do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not right now.
РОСС: It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.
РОСС: Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: How’d you get over that teacher?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn’t. I got under him.
ДЖОУИ: Problem solved.
НЕДРУГ: Bye Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Okay bye.
НЕДРУГ: All right. Bye.
ФИБИ: Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. II’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…
НЕДРУГ: I miss you already!
ФИБИ: I miss you too!
МОНИКА: See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is, don’t you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh totally! Pull my finger.
НЕДРУГ: Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize…
ДЖОУИ: This is it! This is my category.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I got my speech!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you got your gracious loser face?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: On TV?! Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: ‘Kay!
НЕДРУГ: …in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital, Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless, Duncan Harrington from Passions, and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives. And the Soapie goes to……Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!
ДЖОУИ: What the?!
НЕДРУГ: Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
ДЖОУИ: Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are: from Passions: Erin Goff. From One Life to Live: Mary Loren Bishop, from All My Children: Sarah McCann, and from Days of Our Lives: Jessica Ashley. And the winner is……Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight, so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel, who’s sittin’ right there!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
ДЖОУИ: Rach, we had to get out of there because: look what I won!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, you stole her award!
ДЖОУИ: No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.
ДЖОУИ: Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, I behalfin’ it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you have got to take this back!
ДЖОУИ: But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it, and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you really want an award you didn’t win?
ДЖОУИ: No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, it says Best Supporting Actress!
ДЖОУИ: I can scratch that right off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, no: this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real, and that one is gonna mean something.
ДЖОУИ: All right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right? Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: I’ll take it back tomorrow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: If I can’t have it you can’t have it!
НЕДРУГ: Professor Geller?
РОСС: Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
НЕДРУГ: I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
РОСС: And why exactly would I do that?
НЕДРУГ: Because I’m in love with you.
РОСС: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
РОСС: No!
НЕДРУГ: Well why not? You changed Ned’s grade!
РОСС: Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
НЕДРУГ: No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s done this with three other teachers!
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: He’s got a girlfriend!
РОСС: I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
НЕДРУГ: I know! It’s awful. I love you.
МОНИКА: Have you seen Chandler?
ФИБИ: No. Why?
МОНИКА: ‘Cause I just keep thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have, and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.
ФИБИ: Okay, don’t sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute.
МОНИКА: Phoebe! Come on, I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
ФИБИ: No, that is the last thing you want to do!
МОНИКА: Why?
ФИБИ: Because you’re marrying him!
МОНИКА: You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
ФИБИ: All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
МОНИКА: So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?
ФИБИ: That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
МОНИКА: Your mother told you this?
ФИБИ: Yes!
МОНИКА: The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
ФИБИ: Oh my God! You’re right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
ДЖОУИ: Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I’m totally cool!
НЕДРУГ: Come in.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Jessica.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Jess.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ‘Sup?
ДЖОУИ: Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
ДЖОУИ: Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your shelf or anything?
НЕДРУГ: No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
ДЖОУИ: Take it back?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely.
ДЖОУИ: Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
МОНИКА: Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big.
МОНИКА: You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kinda. They’re really big.
МОНИКА: Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
МОНИКА: Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sleeping with somebody new: anxiety, panic, and, I’m afraid, even more sweating.
МОНИКА: Even with me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
МОНИКА: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
МОНИКА: Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Water! Water! Water!
РОСС: Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
НЕДРУГ: That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
РОСС: Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.
НЕДРУГ: What?! Why?
РОСС: ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.
НЕДРУГ: I’m not trying to pull anything. Look, I love you dude.
РОСС: Y’know what? II’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay——Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel, Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. Shall we?
ФИБИ: Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’ll be out in a second.
ФИБИ: Oh. It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
ФИБИ: …in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.
ФИБИ: Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!
