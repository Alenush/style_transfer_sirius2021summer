ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
МОНИКА: What’s the matter? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!! 
ФИБИ: Oh Willie’s still alive! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you guys doing? 
МОНИКА: Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist. 
МОНИКА: That’s not true, there are great pictures of us! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this... 
ФИБИ: Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture. 
МОНИКА: Oh, here’s a great one. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m not in that. 
МОНИКА: I know, but look at me all tan. 
ФИБИ: Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer. 
МОНИКА: That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y’know... 
ФИБИ: Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid. 
МОНИКА: Chandler what do you say? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going. 
РОСС: Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about those three pointers? 
РОСС: Amazing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And those guys were this close to lettin’ us play this time too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy. 
РОСС: Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom. 
ФИБИ: Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, I thought that guy was married. 
ФИБИ: He is! But he’s getting divorced...Ross! Maybe you know him. 
РОСС: It’s not a club. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him? 
РОСС: Hey, divorced men are not bad men! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They have that on the napkins at the club. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I gotta get back to work. 
ФИБИ: You don’t have to be back for a half-hour! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife. 
РОСС: Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it. 
ФИБИ: So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing! 
РОСС: Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude that is so sad. 
РОСС: I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Could I play? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no sit-ups today Tag? 
НЕДРУГ: I just did them. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well drop and give me ten more! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I filled them out last night? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, great could you make me four copies of those? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s up? I’m just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, is Tag here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Why? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, we’ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. All right, back to work. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Isn’t that Tag’s backpack. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor. 
НЕДРУГ: Great! That’s great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I am. 
МОНИКА: Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Or not. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Joey! What are you doing here? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure. Umm...here. 
ДЖОУИ: Great. You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I don’t think so Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, I guess this will be fine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight? 
ДЖОУИ: Nothing, why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay. 
ДЖОУИ: Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not asking you to go on a date with him! 
ДЖОУИ: Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure, no problem. Ooh...Hey, donuts! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: I know. Let’s try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aww! 
МОНИКА: That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it! 
РОСС: I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that’s why I have to kill you." 
МОНИКА: They can’t all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me? 
МОНИКА: Do you really want to pull at that thread? 
ФИБИ: I’m having a really good time! 
НЕДРУГ: Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck. 
ФИБИ: Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey uh, I don’t mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I... Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost. 
НЕДРУГ: I know it’s really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and...Oh no! No! No! My God! 
ФИБИ: Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go. 
НЕДРУГ: No it’s...Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy! 
ФИБИ: Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross? 
РОСС: Yeah? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, umm that’s Whitney , Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out? 
РОСС: What?! No! 
ФИБИ: Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. 
РОСС: Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. 
ФИБИ: Hi Ginger. 
РОСС: All right! I want my key back! 
ФИБИ: I don’t have it! 
РОСС: It’s right there! 
ФИБИ: Ugh, okay Sherlock! 
РОСС: Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex. 
РОСС: Oh yeah...No...You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РОСС: Hi Whitney. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast? 
РОСС: Yep. Okay. 
ФИБИ: Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her! 
РОСС: Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
РОСС: Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay? 
ФИБИ: Watching ballroom dancing? 
РОСС: Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people! 
ФИБИ: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her. 
РОСС: Like what? 
ФИБИ: Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and...No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you! 
РОСС: Okay. 
ФИБИ: And! She uses sex as a weapon! 
РОСС: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons. 
ФИБИ: You’re still gonna go out with her?! 
РОСС: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?! 
РОСС: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me... 
ФИБИ: No listen to me! She is crazy! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, your door isn’t sound proof. 
ФИБИ: You see? Nothing is good enough for her! 
НЕДРУГ: Good morning. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh that’s nice. 
НЕДРУГ: Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wo-women? You mean like old women? 
НЕДРУГ: Well kinda old, like 30. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh? 
НЕДРУГ: A little. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: How you doin’? 
ДЖОУИ: See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You’re changing it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t help it! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Borrow money from me? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, first...first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you’re looking down, keep looking down. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why is there jelly on your shoe? 
ДЖОУИ: I had a donut. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! That guy’s all right! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, all the women. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m right here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just...And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him...but it just bothers me, all right?! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m still right here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush. And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But...I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya! 
ДЖОУИ: I know, Monica told me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Sure. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you people not see me?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, will you talk to him? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts. 
ДЖОУИ: One! No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel. 
ДЖОУИ: Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women. 
НЕДРУГ: Really? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, for you! 
МОНИКА: Hey! There you are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There I am! 
МОНИКА: Are you okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, what were you thinking? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down... 
МОНИКА: Chandler? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Hi. 
РОСС: Hi. 
ФИБИ: So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? 
РОСС: Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay...and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass." 
ФИБИ: Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom. 
РОСС: Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable! 
ФИБИ: You think he’s emotionally unavailable? 
РОСС: I think he can be. 
ФИБИ: Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night! 
РОСС: Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life! 
ФИБИ: Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997. 
РОСС: I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!! 
ФИБИ: We want the last six years back!! 
РОСС: So do we!! So do we!! I’m sorry you had to see that. 
НЕДРУГ: Good morning Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night? 
НЕДРУГ: Went out with Joey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas? 
НЕДРУГ: No. We had a really good talk. I don’t think I’m gonna do that bar scene anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I did not see that coming. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happier when... Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know? 
НЕДРУГ: When I’m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Someone I can spoil, y’know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sp-spoil? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh! Let me ask you something? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I-I’m startin’ too. 
НЕДРУГ: And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Hell yes! 
НЕДРУГ: All right then, it’s settled. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m gettin’ back together with my ex-girlfriend. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’d love to! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah! 
РОСС: My God! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney? 
РОСС: Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was! 
ФИБИ: Oh he knows! For the most part. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey! Good, you’re both here. 
НЕДРУГ: We kinda need to talk. 
ФИБИ: Both of you together? 
РОСС: Wh-what’s up? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing.... 
НЕДРУГ: ...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So.... 
РОСС: Oh just say it Kyle! 
НЕДРУГ: We’re gonna give it another try. 
ФИБИ: What about her whining and her constant need for attention?! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m gonna work on that. 
ФИБИ: Oh right, because you’re so capable of change. 
РОСС: Y’know, he hums when he pees! 
НЕДРУГ: I do know. 
РОСС: It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever. 
НЕДРУГ: We’re so sorry. 
РОСС: That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we’re gonna go. 
РОСС: I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little. 
ФИБИ: Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to. 
РОСС: Yeah, were better off without them. 
ФИБИ: And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club! 
РОСС: Divorced men’s club. 
ФИБИ: Potato, Potaato. 
МОНИКА: Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, let’s see it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahhh. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, that looks good. 
ФИБИ: You guys make a very attractive couple. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we look great together. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, we really do! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like! 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, we don’t have to imagine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m marrying her. 
ДЖОУИ: We’ll just see.
