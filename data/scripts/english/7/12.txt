МОНИКА: Ross, when’s this comet thing start?
РОСС: Well, technically it seven billion years ago.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no! Oh no!
РОСС: Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who’s official name is BapsteinKing.
НЕДРУГ: Okay! Okay!
ФИБИ: There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s a plane!
ФИБИ: Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s pretty amazing too.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. No, you can’t.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh I don’tI don’t know.
РОСС: Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what else makes you wonder?
РОСС: Huh?
ДЖОУИ: Check out the rack on this chick!
МОНИКА: Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I’m not!
ДЖОУИ: Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it’s flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
ФИБИ: Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
ФИБИ: Shh! Get me out of here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: Ross!
РОСС: What?
ДЖОУИ: Come here, check this out!
РОСС: What? Is it the comet?
ДЖОУИ: No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here.
РОСС: Joey come. I can’t believe. I bring you here to see the BapsteinKing comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, there’s two women dude.
РОСС: Show me where?
ДЖОУИ: Right-right up here.
РОСС: Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! Yeah, I do.
РОСС: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: What?! All right. Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
РОСС: It’s called the BapsteinKing comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
ДЖОУИ: Oh no! No! No!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica!
МОНИКА: She’s sleeping.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
МОНИКА: Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry, I just can’t sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like.
МОНИКА: It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! Ow!
ФИБИ: Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can.
НЕДРУГ: Beep!
ФИБИ: Don’t interrupt me!
РОСС: Rachel! Monica!
ДЖОУИ: Come on!
РОСС: I can’t believe this!
ДЖОУИ: All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
РОСС: Yeah, I guess we don’t have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!
ДЖОУИ: Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
РОСС: I know, I wasn’t finished. But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shhh! I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
МОНИКА: With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
МОНИКА: Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!
МОНИКА: Okay that does sound like fun.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
МОНИКА: The second sister dies?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. No, II was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
МОНИКА: The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s correct.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
НЕДРУГ: If this is your idea of sexy talk?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
НЕДРУГ: What contracts?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.
НЕДРУГ: Like what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
НЕДРУГ: Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes I did! And I put a little PostIt on it that said, Must go out today, and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.
НЕДРУГ: I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
НЕДРУГ: No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
НЕДРУГ: You wanna go down to the office right now?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.
НЕДРУГ: Okay I understand. I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
ДЖОУИ: All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.
РОСС: Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in.
ДЖОУИ: Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
РОСС: Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
ДЖОУИ: What if I smack my head on the concrete?
РОСС: Well, I’m not gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know Ross! II tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
РОСС: Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
ДЖОУИ: No.
РОСС: Okay. Well, you be careful.
ДЖОУИ: What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.
РОСС: Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
ДЖОУИ: Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!
ФИБИ: Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do. Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!
МОНИКА: Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? What? What?
МОНИКА: Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here.
НЕДРУГ: Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got. Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
НЕДРУГ: It’s my sister.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
НЕДРУГ: So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a PostIt on it that said, Must go out today. So you just keep looking in there! All right?
НЕДРУГ: It’s not here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
НЕДРУГ: How could I have left them in the copy room?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
НЕДРУГ: Fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Hello? I still don’t get it.
МОНИКА: Are you still awake?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! You?
МОНИКА: You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we’re both up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah? I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
ДЖОУИ: Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! Do you want soup or salad? Both! Always order both!
РОСС: Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? Really? No one’s home?
РОСС: I don’t think so. Hello? When you get in there.
ФИБИ: Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
МОНИКА: What?! What are you doing?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you know what just happened?
МОНИКА: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. We were in the middle of sex and you fell asleep.
МОНИКА: Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica?
МОНИКА: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
МОНИКА: Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Give me the good stuff.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
МОНИКА: Okay, I’m up! I’m up!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh, fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
НЕДРУГ: Still no luck.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
НЕДРУГ: Do you want me to check again?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it’s not in there! How about that drawer?
НЕДРУГ: Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, I don’tI don’t know. Let me, let me check.
НЕДРУГ: Any luck?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? You found them! Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m just really relived this whole thing is over.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You put these on my desk!
НЕДРУГ: I did not!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
НЕДРУГ: How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so hot for you right now.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe Buffay?!
ФИБИ: Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer fireman, can-can I help you?
НЕДРУГ: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
ФИБИ: That’s not mine.
НЕДРУГ: Yes it is.
ФИБИ: How do you know?
НЕДРУГ: The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica.
ФИБИ: Okay do you. Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
НЕДРУГ: Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them.
ФИБИ: Fine! But please God tell me how to stop them from going off!
НЕДРУГ: There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
ФИБИ: There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
РОСС: Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.
ДЖОУИ: All right! Just hurry up!
РОСС: Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
ДЖОУИ: I think face to face.
РОСС: I would say that.
ДЖОУИ: Face to face, yeah!
РОСС: Okay, here I go.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my. How much do you weigh Ross?!
РОСС: I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
РОСС: So what do you want me to do?
ДЖОУИ: Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
РОСС: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Hi.
РОСС: M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
РОСС: It’s still looks pretty far!
ДЖОУИ: It’s not that far! Just drop!
РОСС: Do not rush me!
ДЖОУИ: Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!
РОСС: Oww! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I. Ooh, a quarter!
МОНИКА: That really was some of your best work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hm-hmm, I told you! I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
МОНИКА: I have to be up in seven minutes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes.
МОНИКА: Really?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you wanna?
МОНИКА: Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!
