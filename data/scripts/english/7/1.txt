РОСС: Hey, what’s going on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar." 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah I’ll take that. 
РОСС: What’s up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica and I are engaged. 
РОСС: Oh my God. Congratulations. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. 
РОСС: Where is she? 
МОНИКА: I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m engaged!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over. 
РОСС: Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I’m gay! I’m gay!" Can I bring her in? 
ФИБИ: Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet. 
МОНИКА: I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I’m engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!

МОНИКА: Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my...our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me..us...Damnit! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica. 
МОНИКА: Awww, come on...wait...stop it. Okay, to Monica. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To Monica! 
ФИБИ: So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to... 
ФИБИ: Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you’re on your own. 
МОНИКА: Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza. 
ДЖОУИ: But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986? 
ДЖОУИ: You guys don’t think I look 19? 
ФИБИ: Oh, 19! We thought you said 90! 
МОНИКА: Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here? 
ФИБИ: Oh honey no, you ate it all. 
ДЖОУИ: I was afraid of that. 
МОНИКА: Y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You’re not getting dressed. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Know what I mean? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, but I don’t think we have time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress. 
МОНИКА: Let’s do it! 
МОНИКА: Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you- you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. 
ФИБИ: Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thanks. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You okay over there? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm... No, y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody. 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
РОСС: Wow! Happy Monica’s night! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well thank you, you too. 
РОСС: Thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married? 
РОСС: Well sure. But I get married all the time so... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh... 
РОСС: You okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that? 
РОСС: You mean, we...you and me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone. 
РОСС: Oh good, you scared me for a minute. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shake it off. 
РОСС: I mean...no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm... 
РОСС: Surely you can think of something good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff. 
РОСС: Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands. 
РОСС: My hands? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night! 
РОСС: A what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night. 
РОСС: One night, just-just sex. No strings attached? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah-yeah, we never had that, 
РОСС: No. 
РОСС: Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really...don’t. 
ДЖОУИ: ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me. 
ДЖОУИ: So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on man, really how old?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow thanks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right? 
ДЖОУИ: When? Today? Some, not a lot. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to...I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t. There huh...hmm, there-there was an incident. 
ДЖОУИ: Don’t worry about that man, that happens. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s happened to you? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Once. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what’d you do? 
ДЖОУИ: I did it anyway. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! Come on! Why aren’t you dressed yet?! 
ФИБИ: I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. 
МОНИКА: No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding. 
ФИБИ: Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit. 
МОНИКА: Fair enough, now go get ready! 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my... I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past. 
РОСС: Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw... 
МОНИКА: Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
МОНИКА: See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, but it is just about... 
РОСС: It is! It is! 
МОНИКА: No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
МОНИКА: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder! 
РОСС: Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw! 
РОСС: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: That’s true. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey I swear it we just kissed. 
РОСС: It was just a kiss. 
ФИБИ: You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding? 
МОНИКА: Thunder being stolen!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on! 
РОСС: Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!! 
ФИБИ: What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed... 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: You guys kissed! Oh my...this is huge! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
РОСС: Oh no! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, it’s really not huge. 
РОСС: And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not! 
МОНИКА: Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we? 
ФИБИ: Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem. 
ДЖОУИ: Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel. 
МОНИКА: Yes that would be lovely. 
ДЖОУИ: You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, you can pass for 19. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! 
ДЖОУИ: Seriously? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31! 
ДЖОУИ: I’m 30! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you are not! You’re 31. 
ДЖОУИ: Aww crap! 
ФИБИ: Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s, maybe no more for you though. 
МОНИКА: Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza. 
ФИБИ: Why?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look... 
МОНИКА: No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! Especially with you. 
ДЖОУИ: Psss, that is whack! 
ФИБИ: Yeah? Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don’t." 
ФИБИ: Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away. 
ДЖОУИ: Wouldn’t she? 
ФИБИ: Would she? 
ДЖОУИ: Would she? You ate my candy bar! 
РОСС: Guess who? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing. 
РОСС: Still thinking about it huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you! 
РОСС: Oh, who cares? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I care! 
РОСС: And so do I. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed? 
РОСС: Okay. Sure. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Am I going to let you watch me undress? 
РОСС: No! 
МОНИКА: I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just...it’s so typical. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris. 
МОНИКА: Paris? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la . 
МОНИКА: Keep talking. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can! 
МОНИКА: I love you! 
МОНИКА: Bonjour, monsieur. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s Paris, who knows we’re here! 
МОНИКА: Hi Pheebs, what’s up? 
ФИБИ: Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ФИБИ: Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding! 
ФИБИ: Oh, I see. 
ДЖОУИ: They break your heart, don’t they? 
ФИБИ: Y’know, I don’t really need their permission. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding! 
ФИБИ: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! What’s wrong with my eyes. 
ФИБИ: They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes. 
ДЖОУИ: And that’ll get rid of my wisdom? 
ФИБИ: Maybe just 10 minutes for you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care! 
МОНИКА: Yes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about? 
МОНИКА: Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: Hey, here’s a thought. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what are you talking about? 
МОНИКА: My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, third base. 
МОНИКА: It’s all everybody at the party could talk about! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring! 
МОНИКА: We had a characturist! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!! 
ФИБИ: 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago. 
МОНИКА: And yet, here we are doing it again. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder! 
МОНИКА: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?! 
РОСС: Got me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen! 
МОНИКА: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night! 
МОНИКА: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?! 
РОСС: Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why to save your dignity my man. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night? 
МОНИКА: I don’t know! I don’t...maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow. That...y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex! 
МОНИКА: I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, somebody should. 
РОСС: Look uh, if we’re gonna do this... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it. 
РОСС: Oh, I see, so everybody wins. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who is it? 
МОНИКА: It’s Monica, open up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! 
РОСС: Oww! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you? 
МОНИКА: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How is that ever going to happen?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?! 
МОНИКА: I know why! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No you don’t know why! 
МОНИКА: Okay! Why?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because! Because I was sad. 
МОНИКА: What do you mean? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t care, she slept with me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night. 
МОНИКА: I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. 
РОСС: Well, I’m going to take off. Congratulations man. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks. 
РОСС: And uh, Rachel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
РОСС: What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys is me. 
ФИБИ: 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding. 
ФИБИ: Oh thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer...Oh oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning.
