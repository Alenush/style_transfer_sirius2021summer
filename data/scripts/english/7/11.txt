ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh. Mmm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I. Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it's too delicious.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma’s Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I’m sorry what?
ДЖОУИ: All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So.
ДЖОУИ: Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
ФИБИ: Absolutely!
ДЖОУИ: I’ll see you at 8:00.
ФИБИ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, what’s at 8:00?
ФИБИ: Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
РОСС: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
ФИБИ: Duly noted.
РОСС: Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
МОНИКА: What are you talking about?
РОСС: Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.
МОНИКА: You were invited?!
РОСС: No.
МОНИКА: My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.
РОСС: Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
МОНИКА: Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.
РОСС: Y’know, she tried to undress me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
ФИБИ: Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?
ФИБИ: Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy. Big Daddy?
ФИБИ: Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.
РОСС: Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The RossATron!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!
ДЖОУИ: OhWhaHo! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
ФИБИ: So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
РОСС: Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.
ФИБИ: I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
ДЖОУИ: Wow! I’m so sorry I had no idea it would bother you this much.
ФИБИ: Well, it does.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
ФИБИ: Okay, you wore me down.
РОСС: Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the RossATron?
ДЖОУИ: The Ross. Is that back?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t seem to say goodbye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling. Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
ДЖОУИ: Awww! Mel Torme died.
МОНИКА: Joey, that paper’s like a year old!
ДЖОУИ: Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!
РОСС: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РОСС: So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.
МОНИКА: Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
РОСС: Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
МОНИКА: Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!
РОСС: Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.
МОНИКА: Joan?
РОСС: Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got and guest?!
ДЖОУИ: Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. II think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back.
РОСС: Not broad backed!
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!
РОСС: What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
МОНИКА: Why not?!
РОСС: Bec. Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
МОНИКА: Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.
РОСС: Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan.
ДЖОУИ: Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
МОНИКА: We’ll see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, thank you for lunch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Its still there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mrs. Braverman must be out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No that could kill her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we don’t want that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No so we’re protecting her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But we should take it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But we should move quick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! That’s David!
МОНИКА: David who?
ФИБИ: David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: David! What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
ФИБИ: Well. Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Well II got like thirty of them.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Umm, look III got a confession to make.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, III was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know II was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but II really wanted to see you and but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.
ФИБИ: Well, of course I would want to see you. I. I think about you all the time.
НЕДРУГ: Really? Because I think about you all the time.
ФИБИ: Really?
НЕДРУГ: I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Umm, anyway. Do you want to have dinner tonight?
ФИБИ: Yes! Oh no!
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Uh, what?
ФИБИ: I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
НЕДРУГ: Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: What are you doing?
ФИБИ: Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
МОНИКА: So! He’ll understand!
ФИБИ: No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, II should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!
МОНИКА: God, you are so strong.
ФИБИ: Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! That is so good!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: What do you got there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing tonight?
ДЖОУИ: Huh? Uh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude! Dude!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
ДЖОУИ: What?! Tonight?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s what Monica said.
ДЖОУИ: After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
РОСС: Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
МОНИКА: Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
МОНИКА: I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
МОНИКА: Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!
РОСС: Stop saying, Blood to strangers.
МОНИКА: So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
НЕДРУГ: We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
МОНИКА: Okay, you’re fine.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Are you guys ready?
ФИБИ: Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: And for you sir?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?
НЕДРУГ: It’s uh, it’s already been roasted.
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
ФИБИ: Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
НЕДРУГ: Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, that changes everything! Y’know what Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Huh?
ДЖОУИ: You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I’m very wise. I know.
ДЖОУИ: Y’know-y’know what I really want?
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
НЕДРУГ: Any progress?
ДЖОУИ: Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
ФИБИ: God Joey, this is taking forever!
ДЖОУИ: What’s the rush? What?
ФИБИ: W-w. I just it’s that. I have y’know I haveI have an appointment. And it’s very important.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa, what is it?
ФИБИ: Well. It’s a date.
ДЖОУИ: A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
ФИБИ: Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.
ДЖОУИ: No, I’m gonna! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!
ФИБИ: That. It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
ФИБИ: She was?
ДЖОУИ: Well, she graduated from high school!
ФИБИ: Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!
ДЖОУИ: Fine!
ФИБИ: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Fine!
ФИБИ: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. IIII didn’t think you were coming.
ФИБИ: Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’m very glad you’re here.
ФИБИ: Oh, you’re such a gentleman. Come on! We’re going to my place!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mm-mmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes! Oh yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do we use to split it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! All right, pick a half.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh. There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I’ll pick that one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, sweetheart!
РОСС: Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
НЕДРУГ: Isn’t it a beautiful wedding?!
РОСС: Yes, yes it is. It’s uh. Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
МОНИКА: Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me?
РОСС: Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.
МОНИКА: Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
РОСС: That bitch!
НЕДРУГ: Monica! What.
МОНИКА: Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
РОСС: Hi Frannie, congratulations.
МОНИКА: You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What. Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
НЕДРУГ: I believe you know my husband.
РОСС: So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I hate this but III have to go. II can’t miss my flight.
ФИБИ: Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like.
НЕДРУГ: July. Umm,
ФИБИ: That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
НЕДРУГ: Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.
ФИБИ: That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I. Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I have to leave.
ФИБИ: You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.
НЕДРУГ: II do though.
ФИБИ: I do too.
НЕДРУГ: Bye Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just. Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
ФИБИ: No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never. I may never see him again.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, y’know you could always visit him.
ФИБИ: Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.
ДЖОУИ: Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
ФИБИ: Well. But. Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back.
ДЖОУИ: I can give it a shot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stick to your side!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, come on now!
ДЖОУИ: All right, what are we havin’?
МОНИКА: Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
РОСС: What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
НЕДРУГ: Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
РОСС: Well.
НЕДРУГ: Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
РОСС: Why?! Why on the lips?!
