ДЖОУИ: Morning!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
ДЖОУИ: Pretty good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go I’m late for work.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship that’d be great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
ДЖОУИ: Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner. No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Now, where’d we land on those pancakes?
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work on the door.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
НЕДРУГ: You must be Rachel, I’m Erin.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi. I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would you like some pancakes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on! Why are we here?!
РОСС: Okay, okay take a guess.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The hot chicks?
РОСС: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
РОСС: Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
НЕДРУГ: I’m so sorry!
НЕДРУГ: Sorry!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?
МОНИКА: She sent the chicken back again?!
НЕДРУГ: She says it’s too dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
МОНИКА: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
НЕДРУГ: OH. MY. GAWD!
МОНИКА: Lucky bastard! Janice.
НЕДРУГ: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
МОНИКА: I’m fine.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I’m blind!
МОНИКА: Oh. Uh.
НЕДРУГ: So, who’s the lucky guy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OH. MY. GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?
МОНИКА: Well, she saw the ring.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she freak out?
МОНИКА: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right.
МОНИКА: Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said no right?
МОНИКА: Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You said no right?!
МОНИКА: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lie! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!
МОНИКА: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.
МОНИКА: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
МОНИКА: So-so you would’ve just lied?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!
МОНИКА: Would it really have been that easy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!
МОНИКА: Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! What’s up?
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, who’s your friend? Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Erin! Still here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
ДЖОУИ: Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, listen. I’ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know!

ФИБИ: And call me!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, good to see you again.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Bye-bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye!
ДЖОУИ: So, system kinda broke down huh?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I.
ФИБИ: We want you to marry her!
ДЖОУИ: What?!
ФИБИ: She is so amazing! You have no idea.
ДЖОУИ: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cupid.
ФИБИ: Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.
ДЖОУИ: Man, do you know what guys want!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
ДЖОУИ: My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just. I don’t see it going anywhere.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but you always say that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
ДЖОУИ: Look I’m sorry you guys, II just don’t think so.
ФИБИ: Whatever.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, don’t start judging me! Huh? You’re the one who’s in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Secret affair!
РОСС: People are doing it in front of my book!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry?
РОСС: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
РОСС: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, there was. It was there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read. Yes, there was.
РОСС: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!
ДЖОУИ: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
РОСС: Oh for cryin’ out loud!
ДЖОУИ: All right, so we should go catch our movie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well now what’s the rush?
ДЖОУИ: I like to see the previews. The candy.
ФИБИ: Oh. Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well look who’s here!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Erin.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
НЕДРУГ: What’s wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
ФИБИ: Oh no.
ДЖОУИ: What party?
НЕДРУГ: A birthday party.
ДЖОУИ: Who’s birthday party?
НЕДРУГ: Allison’s birthday party.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, and how is Allison?
НЕДРУГ: 32.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, look how that worked out.
РОСС: Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
НЕДРУГ: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
РОСС: No! No! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
НЕДРУГ: How can I help you?
РОСС: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See II wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
НЕДРУГ: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you.
РОСС: Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! And don’t you follow me!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How did it go with Erin?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
ФИБИ: Yay! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
ФИБИ: Didn’t you sleep together?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don’t get married before I do.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
МОНИКА: He might still show up.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.
МОНИКА: Is that all?
НЕДРУГ: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
МОНИКА: It’s actually going to be just family.
НЕДРУГ: Oh wait you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
ДЖОУИ: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
НЕДРУГ: What about Benitez?
ДЖОУИ: What about Game 1 of the Series?
НЕДРУГ: What about shut up?
ДЖОУИ: You shut up! I love arguing with her. I’ll be right back.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
НЕДРУГ: Look, he’s a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don’t see this having a future.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
НЕДРУГ: Kinda.
ФИБИ: Then change it back!
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry I. It’s just there’s no real spark.
ФИБИ: No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, tramp!
ФИБИ: Does Joey have any idea?
НЕДРУГ: I really don’t think he does. And y’know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y’know, tell him I’mI’m not interested in a serious relationship or something.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! That would be great!
ФИБИ: Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry?
ФИБИ: Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! You wanna go?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, let’s go.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. See you guys later.
НЕДРУГ: Bye guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, see ya.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, thank you so much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
ФИБИ: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
РОСС: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we were we were just looking around.
РОСС: Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
НЕДРУГ: Uhh.
РОСС: Ah. Ah. Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
РОСС: I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, who are you?
РОСС: I’m a professor here uh, Ross. Geller.
НЕДРУГ: Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh. Wait! Did you write this?
РОСС: Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought. You’re.you’re so young.
РОСС: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
РОСС: I am very very sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ФИБИ: So how was, how was your date?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70 30 but still. And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
ФИБИ: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: JoJoey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
ДЖОУИ: Where are you gettin’ this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! Right?
ФИБИ: Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.
ДЖОУИ: No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that too. Joey?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you want some pancakes?
ДЖОУИ: Finally!
МОНИКА: What are we gonna do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I say we go with Careless Whisper.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
МОНИКА: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
МОНИКА: Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?
НЕДРУГ: Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
НЕДРУГ: Do you have any tissues?
МОНИКА: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
НЕДРУГ: Okay!
МОНИКА: We’ll just we’ll just let her stay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
МОНИКА: Kinda like your Barca lounger.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
МОНИКА: I never stop thinking about it.
НЕДРУГ: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.
НЕДРУГ: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. Do you hear that?
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
НЕДРУГ: Why?
МОНИКА: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
НЕДРУГ: He does?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Say again?
МОНИКА: That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Feelings, such strong feelings.
МОНИКА: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my. Gawd, II understand. II am so sorry, I’ll go. Good-bye Monica, I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
РОСС: Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby to shine in people’s eye. Okay, see you later.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just wanted to show Monica your book.
