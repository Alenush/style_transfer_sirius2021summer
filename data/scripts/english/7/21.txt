МОНИКА: Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby! Four weeks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you realize you get louder each week?
МОНИКА: There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.
МОНИКА: Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
МОНИКА: No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
МОНИКА: Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, there are no words… There are no words! This should not be this hard!
ДЖОУИ: All right, uh… Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
РОСС: Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica what?
ФИБИ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is the emergency?!
МОНИКА: You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
МОНИКА: Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
ФИБИ: Oh! Yeah!
РОСС: Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.
РОСС: everyone, this is Chandler!
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, Chandler, even though we were friends there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
МОНИКА: Ennnh.
МОНИКА: Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
ФИБИ: Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you. Like… Or all the things you taught him.
МОНИКА: Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four, five, six, and seven!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There are seven?! That’s one?
МОНИКА: It’s kind of an important one!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know, sometimes that helps.
МОНИКА: All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7.…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, Monica…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica…
ДЖОУИ: …when I look back over our time together…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.
ФИБИ: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
МОНИКА: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You'll get one.
МОНИКА: Oh yeah? When?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
МОНИКА: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
МОНИКА: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no.
МОНИКА: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, uh.
МОНИКА: Well?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
РОСС: I’m getting married today! Ahh, whoo-hoo!
МОНИКА: Do you think he knew I was here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice try.
МОНИКА: Wait, wait, wait!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Monica…
МОНИКА: Look!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is not going to work.
МОНИКА: I bet this will work!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are so great! I love you!
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing! I said, I said You're so great and then I just, I just stopped talking!
МОНИКА: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I didn't!
МОНИКА: Yes, you did!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I didn't!
МОНИКА: You love me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
МОНИКА: Then all your stuff would be here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
МОНИКА: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
МОНИКА: You wanted it to be a surprise.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought… Wait a minute, II can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
МОНИКА: Yes.
ДЖОУИ: Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
МОНИКА: Come in! Come in! We’re engaged!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, what have you guys been up to?
РОСС: Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
ДЖОУИ: How is Monica, I love your sweet ass, inappropriate?
РОСС: How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
ФИБИ: Well let’s just say its, she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
РОСС: I can’t believe that in four weeks they’re gonnta be married!
ФИБИ: Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
РОСС: Phoebe that’s not true.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
ДЖОУИ: Has it been that long?!
РОСС: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I've had a very long, hard day.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
МОНИКА: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke——Diet Coke.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
ДЖОУИ: I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
ДЖОУИ: You?! And-and you?!
МОНИКА: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
ДЖОУИ: How?! When?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It happened in London.
ДЖОУИ: IN LONDON!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
ДЖОУИ: But it is a big deal! I have to tell someone!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
МОНИКА: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
ДЖОУИ: All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
МОНИКА: I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
МОНИКА: Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Arghh!
ФИБИ: Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ФИБИ: Ahhh! Chandler and Monica! Chandler and Monica!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: CHANDLER AND MONICA!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH MY GOD!
ФИБИ: OH! MY EYES! MY EYES!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! Phoebe! It's okay! It's okay!
ФИБИ: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW!
ФИБИ: YOU KNOW?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming!
РОСС: What's going on?
НЕДРУГ: Ohhh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: HI! Hi!
РОСС: What?! What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
РОСС: Actually, it looks really good.
ФИБИ: Get in here!
ФИБИ: Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
ФИБИ: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
МОНИКА: Bye!
НЕДРУГ: Bye!
ФИБИ: Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!
МОНИКА: Actually, I did!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
МОНИКА: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe knows about us!
ДЖОУИ: Well I didn't tell them!
МОНИКА: Them?! Who's them?
ДЖОУИ: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
МОНИКА: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
МОНИКА: Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!
ФИБИ: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you kidding?!
ФИБИ: No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
ДЖОУИ: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: They know you know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
ФИБИ: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
ДЖОУИ: I couldn't even if I wanted to.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
МОНИКА: She's bluffing!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
ФИБИ: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay!
ДЖОУИ: I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
ФИБИ: Joey! Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.
ДЖОУИ: It's not my first time.
МОНИКА: You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
МОНИКА: Of course.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you're-you're going?
ФИБИ: Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
ФИБИ: You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not if I kiss you first.
ФИБИ: Ooh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
ФИБИ: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win! I can't have sex with ya!
ФИБИ: And why not?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because I'm in love with Monica!
ФИБИ: You're-you're what?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER! I love her! I love you, Monica.
МОНИКА: I love you too, Chandler.
ФИБИ: I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
ДЖОУИ: So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
МОНИКА: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
РОСС: No! No! Wh… What are you doing?! GET OFF MY SISTER!
ФИБИ: Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You really think it would be that different?
ФИБИ: How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, things change.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
РОСС: It’ll be okay Joe.
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
РОСС: That little naked guy would be me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aww, look at the little thing.
РОСС: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who are those people?
РОСС: Got me.
МОНИКА: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
МОНИКА: Let's see, 1939, yeah, 24, 25?
РОСС: Looks like a fun gang.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
РОСС: No-no, that would be me again.
МОНИКА: Hey, you guys!
ФИБИ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s going on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.
МОНИКА: Oh that’s so sweet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So we both finished our vows.
ФИБИ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, can we read them?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Oh, that’s beautiful.
ДЖОУИ: Funny one! That’s good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, will-will you marry me?
ДЖОУИ: What? I don’t get it.
РОСС: Oh man, this is hilarious.
МОНИКА: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, what do you guys think?
РОСС: Dude!
ДЖОУИ: I have never known love like this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You really like it?
РОСС: Dude! How-how did you write this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
РОСС: You can’t do that!
ДЖОУИ: If he goes first he can!
