РОСС: Happy birthday!
МОНИКА: Happy birthday!
НЕДРУГ: Rach! Come on! Rach!
МОНИКА: It’s your birthday!
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
НЕДРУГ: Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don’t use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
ДЖОУИ: They do!
ФИБИ: Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
МОНИКА: Chocolate-chip pancakes!
РОСС: We’ve got presents!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good ones?
МОНИКА: They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
ДЖОУИ: Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
РОСС: Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
ДЖОУИ: Why God?! Why?! We had a deal! Let the others grow old! Not me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.
РОСС: Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.
ДЖОУИ: And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
МОНИКА: Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.
ФИБИ: Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.
НЕДРУГ: Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There you go!
ФИБИ: I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
НЕДРУГ: Come on, let’s have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.
МОНИКА: Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
РОСС: Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? II have a child!
РОСС: How hot do I look in this, huh?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
РОСС: That’s not what this is about okay? II am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?
РОСС: I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe you bought this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
ФИБИ: Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
РОСС: Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
РОСС: Damnit!
ФИБИ: Okay, who’s next?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
ФИБИ: Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch!
НЕДРУГ: Look Rachel, I know what you’re going through. I’m totally freaked about turning 25.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Get out, get out of my apartment.
МОНИКА: All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.
ФИБИ: Least of all you.
НЕДРУГ: Why? What you’d do?
МОНИКА: Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!
ДЖОУИ: But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.
НЕДРУГ: You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old!
НЕДРУГ: It’s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
НЕДРУГ: Crap.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.
МОНИКА: Heyyy! You got the door open!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey are you drunk?
МОНИКА: Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
МОНИКА: Noo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!
МОНИКА: Noo!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!
МОНИКА: Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.
МОНИКА: Really?! You promise?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ll take care of it.
МОНИКА: Okay. I love you so much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay we have to do something about your breath.
МОНИКА: What about your breath?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
МОНИКА: Okay. I can do that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Surprise!
РОСС: Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! Okay, back—Stop! Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!
МОНИКА: Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.
НЕДРУГ: Is this yours?
ДЖОУИ: Well actually…
РОСС: No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, you soooo need this car.
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!
ФИБИ: Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
НЕДРУГ: Right, why do you keep saying that?
ФИБИ: Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, no we’re not thirty. We’re 31. Okay.
ФИБИ: Wait!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it’s you.
ФИБИ: Yeah. What?!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we’re not thirty, we’re 31.
ФИБИ: Nu-uh!
НЕДРУГ: Yea-huh! That’s what is says on my birth certificate.
ФИБИ: You have your birth certificate?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
ФИБИ: Our mom.
НЕДРУГ: Right! Okay.
ФИБИ: Do you have my birth certificate?
НЕДРУГ: No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: I just lost a whole year of my life.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Your middle name is Pamela?
НЕДРУГ: Yes.
ФИБИ: Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Phoebe.
ФИБИ: That’s my first name.
НЕДРУГ: Right, okay, then no.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
МОНИКА: Yay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See? Here we go.
НЕДРУГ: Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
НЕДРУГ: Don’t get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
МОНИКА: Paul!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phil.
МОНИКА: Phil!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.
ФИБИ: Hey, what’s going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica’s a little drunk.
ФИБИ: Yay! I love drunk Monica!
МОНИКА: Awwwww…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Go change! She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.
ФИБИ: Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica’s wasted.
РОСС: Maybe that will liven up this party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, will you just go help her change please!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Yep.
НЕДРУГ: This one’s from me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh!
НЕДРУГ: It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A scooter!
РОСС: Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That’s funny, yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, because you’re not a grandmother!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny.
МОНИКА: All you had to do was buy the card!
РОСС: Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids.
ФИБИ: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: As I was saying. I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
ФИБИ: If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.
МОНИКА: Really! That long?! Look all you want, it’s happening!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years. Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.
РОСС: Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
ДЖОУИ: Will you quit hoggin’ it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
РОСС: You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How are you feeling?
МОНИКА: You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
РОСС: I really wish that you wouldn’t.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.
ФИБИ: Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!
НЕДРУГ: Speech! Come on Monica!
РОСС: Come on!
НЕДРУГ: Come on! Speech!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!
НЕДРУГ: Oh-ho, I think it’s nice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it’s necessary.
МОНИКА: III wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…
ФИБИ: Wooo! Hoo!
МОНИКА: I really like to say that I’m-um… Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk! That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered! And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of DingDongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
ФИБИ: Okay quick, help me get this off!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
ФИБИ: I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.
ФИБИ: Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
ДЖОУИ: That’s not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
ФИБИ: Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
ДЖОУИ: Like what?
ФИБИ: Like okay III, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
ФИБИ: No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home.
МОНИКА: Oh man!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: He’s gonna eat the cake!
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, and plus I’m 1 16th Portuguese.
ФИБИ: Oh!
РОСС: Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I really don’t think…
РОСС: Lift! And slide!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, here we go.
РОСС: All right everyone, lift! And slide!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, can I…
ДЖОУИ: Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.
ДЖОУИ: Okay!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not in the street!
ДЖОУИ: Yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm…
НЕДРУГ: What’s up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’tI don’t…
НЕДРУГ: Wait! I think I see where you’re going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel, don’t do this. This is just because you’re turning thirty.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!
НЕДРУГ: Twenty-four actually.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
НЕДРУГ: Me too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! How’d it go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
ФИБИ: You did the right thing.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t like this anymore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
РОСС: God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
ДЖОУИ: Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
РОСС: Yes! My baby’s finally free!
ДЖОУИ: All-all right! Start it up! Let’s go!
РОСС: Woohoo!
НЕДРУГ: How hot are we?
РОСС: You wanna buy a car?
ДЖОУИ: No.
НЕДРУГ: There was no credits scene with this episode.
