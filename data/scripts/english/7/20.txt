РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next? 
ДЖОУИ: Probably Monica and Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh umm, uh we don’t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street. 
НЕДРУГ: That’d be great, thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Melissa! 
НЕДРУГ: You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh——Why don’t I tell you over here? 
НЕДРУГ: So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren! 
НЕДРУГ: Shut up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh please… 
НЕДРУГ: Are you?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um… 
НЕДРУГ: You do now. You’re having dinner with me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shut up. 
НЕДРУГ: I-I’ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here’s my card. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wow thanks! Oh you’re in real estate! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! What do you do now? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m a party planner. I’ll see you tomorrow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college. 
РОСС: She seems really, really fun! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close. 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you… 
ДЖОУИ: Who you what? Who you what?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. 
МОНИКА: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s not a big deal! 
МОНИКА: They were lovers. 
РОСС: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit. 
РОСС: So that’s two of my wives. 
МОНИКА: Okay, so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people’s names on them. And Rach, here you are. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren’t for playing are they? 
МОНИКА: Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins. 
МОНИКА: Chandler, relax it’s not a contest. Certainly not a close one. 
ДЖОУИ: Hello! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Stop picturing it!! 
МОНИКА: Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, so where are my parents gonna be? 
МОНИКА: Oh! Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm you’re parents will be at home in Queens. 
ДЖОУИ: What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed! 
МОНИКА: Why would they think they’re invited? 
ДЖОУИ: You got me. I don’t… 
МОНИКА: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’! 
МОНИКА: Ross’s parents are my parents! 
ДЖОУИ: Well-well—see? Parents are comin’! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I think we should invite them. 
МОНИКА: Oh please, you just want more blue pins. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well this is just sad! 
МОНИКА: All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is not a problem. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you’ll order a little sangria? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, get out of here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean like for award shows? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Some of them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, who wore those? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not bad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This one is uh Paul O’Neil. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who’s that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pierce Brosnan? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 007?! This is James Bond’s tux?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s a pretty cool tux. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this? 
ДЖОУИ: We should really learn how to play the real way. 
ФИБИ: I like our way. Oh! Chess! 
ДЖОУИ: Nice move. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one? 
ДЖОУИ: No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what are you going to wear? 
ДЖОУИ: Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. Does Monica know about this? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t think so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I please be there when you tell her? 
ФИБИ: Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl. 
ДЖОУИ: Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera. 
ФИБИ: What is this? What’s going on? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version? 
ФИБИ: Joey’s! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I’m sure that happened. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It-it did! 
ФИБИ: Sure! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. It happened! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! 
ФИБИ: Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek. 
ДЖОУИ: Why are you taking this away from me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?! 
ФИБИ: Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened! 
ФИБИ: Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Vanilla?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas! 
ФИБИ: To Ross. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you. 
ФИБИ: Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho, you should get inside my head. 
РОСС: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? 
РОСС: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
РОСС: That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux! 
РОСС: So? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special. 
РОСС: Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?! 
РОСС: Pretty please? Not very uh, 007. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you. 
РОСС: When I got married you slept with my sister. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was pretty 007. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, they’re not coming. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted. 
МОНИКА: Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad. 
ДЖОУИ: Look Mon, if you could just call my mom… 
МОНИКА: Oh Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years. 
МОНИКА: No she hasn’t. 
ДЖОУИ: Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you? 
МОНИКА: Well, what am I going to say? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… 
МОНИКА: Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What, are they Irish?! 
НЕДРУГ: …anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Oh, that’s great! 
НЕДРУГ: Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? 
ФИБИ: Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon. 
НЕДРУГ: What one? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Remember?! We—come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops… 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: …we went back to the house and we got really silly and we…we made out. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about. 
ФИБИ: Really?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross is Batman! 
МОНИКА: Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond! 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Batman has a utility belt! 
МОНИКА: 007 has a fancy car! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Batman has the Batmobile! 
МОНИКА: 007 gets all the ladies. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right? 
МОНИКА: How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, I don’t like martinis. 
МОНИКА: How about a Youhoo with a funny straw? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, yum! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six? 
МОНИКА: The show?! 
ДЖОУИ: Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right? 
МОНИКА: Have you ever been to one of my weddings? 
ДЖОУИ: Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding! 
МОНИКА: The wedding starts at six. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there? 
МОНИКА: You’ll vamp?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! There is no-one better! There is no-one greater! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How can you not remember us kissing?! 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together? 
ФИБИ: Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No!! 
ФИБИ: Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you Phoebe. 
НЕДРУГ: She didn’t. 
ФИБИ: I know. 
РОСС: Hey! 
МОНИКА: You just carry that around? 
РОСС: Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. 
МОНИКА: Between you and… 
РОСС: Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight. 
МОНИКА: A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants. 
РОСС: Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, does that mean that you’re not going to be wearing yours? 
РОСС: What, are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me try it on! 
РОСС: Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What’s this? 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy! 
РОСС: Let me see that! Oh man! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second? 
МОНИКА: All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the altar and scream racial slurs? I don’t care! 
ДЖОУИ: No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day. 
МОНИКА: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It happened! I am telling you it happened! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don’t think I’ll be calling you because umm, y’know you’ve gotten weird. Take care you guys. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! 
НЕДРУГ: My God! You love me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin’ together I… I just didn’t want to tell you ‘cause I didn’t think that you’d return my love, and now that you have… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
НЕДРУГ: Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser! 
НЕДРУГ: Shut up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh you don’t have to be sorry. I’m…I’m obviously kidding. I’m not in love with you. I’m not in love with her. I don’t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don’t…picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh…kiss good-bye? No? Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What the hell was that?! 
ФИБИ: I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And? 
ФИБИ: I’ve had better. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! I found one that fits! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whose is it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whose is it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t want to say. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Diane Keaton.
