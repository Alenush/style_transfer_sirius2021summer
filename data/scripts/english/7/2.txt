ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Who wants French toast?
РОСС: Oh, I’ll have some!
ДЖОУИ: Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
МОНИКА: Oww!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s the matter honey?
МОНИКА: I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
ФИБИ: It starts?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!
МОНИКА: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Already?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks.
РОСС: Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
МОНИКА: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What in God’s name is that?!
РОСС: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
МОНИКА: This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
ФИБИ: That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
РОСС: And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at.
ФИБИ: Hey! Ross!
РОСС: Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
ФИБИ: I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
РОСС: Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you. Wh-what’s going on?
ФИБИ: Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
РОСС: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
ФИБИ: Nothing. Why?!
РОСС: Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
ФИБИ: Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
РОСС: Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
ФИБИ: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
МОНИКА: All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw.
МОНИКА: A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick. And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y’know, something a little snugglyer?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
ДЖОУИ: Well, the duck.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
МОНИКА: Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Centerpieces!
МОНИКА: Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Definitely roses. Well, I just think they’re a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! It’s like one mind.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh!
ДЖОУИ: Guys! Guys! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
ДЖОУИ: Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ДЖОУИ: All right, I’m gonna go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!
ДЖОУИ: Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That’s so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar. The vicar? wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his. Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
РОСС: Uh, Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Oh Ross, hi.
РОСС: Phoebe, what are you doing?
ФИБИ: I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.
РОСС: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Okay, let’s talk outside.
РОСС: Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!
ФИБИ: What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
РОСС: And they knew about it?
ФИБИ: Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
РОСС: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
ФИБИ: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
РОСС: The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle. beer! Cold beer.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?
ДЖОУИ: Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
ДЖОУИ: Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, did you eat my face cream?
ДЖОУИ: Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, where did you learn that word?
ДЖОУИ: Where do you think, Zelda?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You found my book?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah I did!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
ДЖОУИ: You got porn!
РОСС: Hello.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
РОСС: Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh great.
РОСС: Can I, can I help you with something?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?
РОСС: Yes I am.
НЕДРУГ: Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I’ll be back to pick him up in an hour.
НЕДРУГ: So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
НЕДРУГ: I remember when we first got engaged.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.
МОНИКА: Oh dad, really you don’t need to.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don’t know that happened.
НЕДРУГ: You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What a sweet story.
МОНИКА: Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
НЕДРУГ: What?! They wanted a scary story!
МОНИКА: Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
НЕДРУГ: You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.
МОНИКА: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?
НЕДРУГ: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
МОНИКА: I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
НЕДРУГ: We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.
МОНИКА: You bought the beach house when I was 23!
НЕДРУГ: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie.
НЕДРУГ: We really do feel bad about this though.
НЕДРУГ: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
МОНИКА: What about when I started dating Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think he’d ever propose!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
МОНИКА: I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
НЕДРУГ: We might still have some money, if your father didn’t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
НЕДРУГ: It seemed like such a simple idea.
НЕДРУГ: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
НЕДРУГ: All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
РОСС: Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. Ohh, that’s soft.
МОНИКА: I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well what happened at dinner?
МОНИКА: My parents spent the money for our wedding!
ФИБИ: My God! What did you order?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, it’s gonna be okay.
МОНИКА: No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown you can wear off the rack.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
ФИБИ: Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?
МОНИКА: How? I don’t have any money.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I have some.
МОНИКА: How much?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, close to.
МОНИКА: Whoa! Are you kidding me?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well what?! How-how much is it?!
МОНИКА: It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Really?!
МОНИКА: How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
НЕДРУГ: Ah, yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
ФИБИ: Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
МОНИКА: This is the most special day of our lives.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
МОНИКА: Honey, umm II love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
МОНИКА: You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I am!
ФИБИ: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well no, I don’t smell anything.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.
РОСС: Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing!
РОСС: Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
РОСС: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
РОСС: Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! ‘Sup?
ФИБИ: Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
РОСС: Excuse me ladies. I’m sorry?
ФИБИ: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
РОСС: I gave him an extremely professional massage!
ФИБИ: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
РОСС: Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
ФИБИ: Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
РОСС: Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
РОСС: He said he liked that! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
РОСС: His daughter was hot.
ДЖОУИ: Gotcha.
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ehh.
МОНИКА: Eh, you work for that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
МОНИКА: You do?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.
МОНИКА: Oh, you’re so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
МОНИКА: You thought about that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
МОНИКА: How many kids were we gonna have?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
МОНИКА: What else did you think about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
МОНИКА: Y’know what? II don’t want a big, fancy wedding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure you do.
МОНИКА: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You sure?
МОНИКА: Uh-hmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you so much.
МОНИКА: I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, totally!
МОНИКА: Oh good.
ДЖОУИ: Hello, Zelda.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who are you supposed to be?
ДЖОУИ: The vicar!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you even know what a vicar is?
ДЖОУИ: Like a goalie, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s. I’m not it’s just not funny anymore!
ДЖОУИ: All right, I’m sorry. Rach I. Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!
ДЖОУИ: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
ДЖОУИ: IIII did?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
ДЖОУИ: This body?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey sex me up!
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride!
ДЖОУИ: I don’t want to, I’m scared.
