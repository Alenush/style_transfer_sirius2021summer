РОСС: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it. 
РОСС: It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship! 
МОНИКА: Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You let Joey drive it?! 
ФИБИ: I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time. 
МОНИКА: Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, "You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel" plan! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. 
МОНИКА: Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding. 
РОСС: Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you got a couple hours? 
РОСС: Whew! That was a brisk ride! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Take the top down did ya? 
РОСС: Only way to fly. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver! 
РОСС: You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader. 
РОСС: Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross. 
РОСС: What?! Give-give me a brush. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gimme the keys! 
РОСС: No way! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well no brush! 
РОСС: Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alimony. 
МОНИКА: Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation. 
МОНИКА: Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not that close. I haven’t seen him in years. 
МОНИКА: Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. 
МОНИКА: So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care. 
ФИБИ: Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahhh! Ooh, nice! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My God! 
РОСС: What do you think you’re doing?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just washing the windshield. 
РОСС: There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.} 
РОСС: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car! 
РОСС: With you?! Yeah right! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. 
РОСС: Okay! Okay! Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you doing?! Get in the front! 
РОСС: In the death seat?!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my… 
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey sweetie! 
НЕДРУГ: Ready to go? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. 
НЕДРУГ: Wait a minute! 
ФИБИ: What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going. 
ДЖОУИ: So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out? 
НЕДРУГ: Over a month. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure, I’d like that. 
ДЖОУИ: So uh, what’s your name? 
НЕДРУГ: It's Jake. 
ДЖОУИ: Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, big fan. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday. 
МОНИКА: Here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s this? 
МОНИКА: It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!! We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please? 
МОНИКА: We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know we already went over this and I won! 
МОНИКА: No you didn’t. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna. 
МОНИКА: Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know… 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack! 
МОНИКА: Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi! 
МОНИКА: Who’s Mr. Garibaldi? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does it matter?! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you. 
МОНИКА: Yes! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I really never get to win anymore? 
МОНИКА: How much did ever really win before? 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear! 
ФИБИ: I know. They were mine. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. No! No wait, that’s weird! 
ФИБИ: No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s weird! 
ФИБИ: I’m wearing his briefs right now. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s…kinda hot. 
ФИБИ: I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that. 
ФИБИ: And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture! 
ФИБИ: There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys. 
ФИБИ: I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I am secure with my masculinity. 
ФИБИ: Okay, whatever. 
ДЖОУИ: You’ve seen my huge stack of porn, right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed. 
РОСС: You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… 
РОСС: What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-oh. 
РОСС: Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? You think so? 
РОСС: I was talking to myself! You’re going down! 
НЕДРУГ: Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas and the strip before we arrive at 4 Queens bar, where Chandler and Monica are sitting at a table waiting for the show to start. 
НЕДРУГ: Has someone taken your order yet? 
МОНИКА: Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. She? I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t… 
НЕДРУГ: Hm-mmm? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I just ordered a beer! 
НЕДРУГ: You’re straight. I get it. 
МОНИКА: I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re here yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides, he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either. 
МОНИКА: Why not?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. Here we go. 
НЕДРУГ: Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello darlings. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And there’s daddy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over! 
РОСС: Yeah, I’ll get right on that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh come on Ross!! 
РОСС: No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi officer, was I going a little too fast? 
РОСС: Oh my God. 
НЕДРУГ: Can I see your license please? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest. 
НЕДРУГ: Your license? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s Hanson. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oops sorry, my mistake. 
РОСС: Dear Lord!! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
РОСС: Here it comes. 
НЕДРУГ: This is a great picture. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah? Well you look phenomenal. 
РОСС: Well she should, it was taken ten years ago! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes I am. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: You’re an Aquarius, huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I bet you’re a Gemini. 
НЕДРУГ: Nope. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Taurus? 
НЕДРУГ: Nope. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Virgo? 
НЕДРУГ: Nope. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sagittarius? 
НЕДРУГ: Yep. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I knew it! I knew it, ahh…. 
НЕДРУГ: Well I tell you what… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: You’re not gonna speed anymore right? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I won’t speed. 
НЕДРУГ: And you promise you’ll get this taken care of right away? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I promise. 
НЕДРУГ: And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Can he handle the stick? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well… 
РОСС: I can handle the stick!! 
НЕДРУГ: I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and… 
НЕДРУГ: Gay! 
МОНИКА: That can’t be your father. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano. 
НЕДРУГ: For I’m loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience. 
МОНИКА: Relax! You’ll be fine. Oh much better. You’re invisible now. 
НЕДРУГ: Where are you from? 
НЕДРУГ: Bakersfield. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry? 
НЕДРУГ: Bakersfield! 
НЕДРУГ: No-no I heard! I’m just sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. 
МОНИКА: Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Check it out. How much of a man am I?! 
ФИБИ: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut. 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about. 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. 
ДЖОУИ: The silk? Feels really good! 
ФИБИ: Huh. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be. 
ФИБИ: That’s great Joe! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear! 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. 
ДЖОУИ: Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about? 
ФИБИ: Hmm? 
ДЖОУИ: Pantyhose! Y’know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… I should go take these off shouldn’t I? 
ФИБИ: I think it’s important that you do. 
НЕДРУГ: So what’s your name? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating parents. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, they’re a hoot. 
НЕДРУГ: And who is your friend? 
МОНИКА: I’m-I’m Monica. 
НЕДРУГ: Monica! Where are you from? 
МОНИКА: New York. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually Monica and I are engaged. 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day? 
МОНИКА: In…in two weeks. 
НЕДРУГ: I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you’re bald? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there. 
НЕДРУГ: We? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know it would make me happy, ma’am. 
НЕДРУГ: Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something. 
МОНИКА: You okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Thanks for making me do this. 
НЕДРУГ: Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life… It’s raining men! 
НЕДРУГ: Hallelujah! 
НЕДРУГ: It’s raining men! 
НЕДРУГ: Amen! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Remind me to introduce you to someone! 
РОСС: Who? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fourth gear!! 
РОСС: What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position. 
РОСС: Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s a different guy! 
РОСС: Good evening officer. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you know how fast you were traveling back there? 
РОСС: Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty. 
НЕДРУГ: You’re right. It was 37. 
РОСС: I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya? 
НЕДРУГ: That’s right. 
РОСС: Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night… 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: Your license please. 
РОСС: You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s Petty. I’ll be right back with your ticket. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You have a son! 
РОСС: I know. I know. 
ФИБИ: Feel better? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I understand. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think so. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! 
ДЖОУИ: Hm-mmm. 
НЕДРУГ: $4.50 please. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
