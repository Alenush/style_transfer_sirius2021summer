ФИБИ: Oh hey! How was your audition?
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry, do I know you?
ФИБИ: What are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!
ФИБИ: Oh! You got it?!
ДЖОУИ: Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.
МОНИКА: What was it for?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.
ФИБИ: The next next?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. Hello!
НЕДРУГ: Joey! It’s Estelle! I just talked to the casting people: they loved you!
ДЖОУИ: They loved me!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: There’s just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
ФИБИ: What’s the matter?
ДЖОУИ: They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
МОНИКА: Wow!
ДЖОУИ: I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!
ФИБИ: Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.
ФИБИ: Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
МОНИКА: Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
РОСС: A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
МОНИКА: Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
ФИБИ: Sure.
МОНИКА: I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us for a few days.
РОСС: Cassie?
МОНИКА: Uh-hmm.
РОСС: Wow, I haven’t seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
МОНИКА: Ross, she’s 25 years old.
РОСС: So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
ФИБИ: Yeah!
МОНИКА: Subtle guys!
ФИБИ: What?!
МОНИКА: I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!
МОНИКА: Okay. Sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
МОНИКА: Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
МОНИКА: That’s what you say about porn.
ДЖОУИ: You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.
МОНИКА: No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
ДЖОУИ: Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.
МОНИКА: Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing.
ФИБИ: Well, when can we have this shower?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…
ФИБИ: Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yesterday!
ФИБИ: Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
ФИБИ: Rachel, calm down!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.
ФИБИ: Just calm down woman!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, I already, I already did.
ФИБИ: Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
ФИБИ: Uh, here. What time?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 4 o’clock. Food?
ФИБИ: Finger sandwiches and tea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh great! Very Monica.
ФИБИ: And chili!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
ФИБИ: Both!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We’re paying for this y’know.
ФИБИ: Neither.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
ФИБИ: Lusts of the flesh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: I don’t know. A cowboy theme?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I’mI’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
МОНИКА: Oh boy, me too!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
МОНИКА: Yeah?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
МОНИКА: The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s me! Come on!
МОНИКА: Okay. But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
МОНИКА: Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
НЕДРУГ: I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! Nice to meet you!
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you too.
МОНИКА: So, are you ready to go?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll be right with you.
МОНИКА: Cassie needs to stay at your place.
РОСС: What—why?
МОНИКА: Because Purvy Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.
РОСС: What?! Chandler, she’s our cousin!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
МОНИКА: You were staring about eight inches south of there.
РОСС: Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
МОНИКА: She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
МОНИКА: Wafer thin ice!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I’m back!
НЕДРУГ: Hi-hi Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I tried to call you. You didn’t need to come down here today.
ДЖОУИ: Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
НЕДРУГ: Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
ДЖОУИ: And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
НЕДРУГ: Well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Sure! That’s great!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
НЕДРУГ: Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah, and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t Jewish. So…
ДЖОУИ: So…What?
НЕДРУГ: So uh well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying?
ДЖОУИ: Yes!
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: No. What?
НЕДРУГ: An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be…
ДЖОУИ: Barmitsvahed?
МОНИКА: So to get this part you can’t be?
ДЖОУИ: Nope.
МОНИКА: But you are?
ДЖОУИ: Yep.
МОНИКА: But you told them you weren’t?
ДЖОУИ: That’s right.
МОНИКА: Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
МОНИКА: Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!
ДЖОУИ: I knI know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
ДЖОУИ: I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part.
МОНИКА: Unless!
ДЖОУИ: Unless what?
МОНИКА: Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
ДЖОУИ: Like what?
МОНИКА: Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
ФИБИ: Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
ФИБИ: Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! What’s up Mon?
МОНИКА: Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Have at it.
МОНИКА: Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work. Cheese? That won’t work. Olive loaf? I hope that won’t work.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
МОНИКА: No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We have to get her a present?!
ФИБИ: Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! We have a guest list!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
РОСС: Cassie?!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Ross!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
РОСС: Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn’t.
НЕДРУГ: Ah yeah, sorry about that.
РОСС: It’s okay. Come, come on in.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot.
РОСС: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
РОСС: Uh-huh. Yeah, II have a knack for impressions.
НЕДРУГ: Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
РОСС: Yeah—No!
РОСС: Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
НЕДРУГ: I’m all done.
РОСС: Thank God.
НЕДРУГ: I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
РОСС: Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? We’re probably too old to do that now.
НЕДРУГ: I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles.
РОСС: Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
НЕДРУГ: It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
РОСС: Well I’m, I’m a little slow. Just as our children would be.
ФИБИ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ФИБИ: How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
НЕДРУГ: Oh thank you.
ФИБИ: Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it’s so nice to see you.
НЕДРУГ: No.
НЕДРУГ: No thanks.
ФИБИ: Okay. Hey Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: Who the hell are all these people?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
ФИБИ: Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that: Losers!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
НЕДРУГ: I was her accountant four years ago.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhh!
НЕДРУГ: I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes these last four years.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s great!
НЕДРУГ: So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse us for a minute. You didn’t tell her to come?!
ФИБИ: You were supposed to tell her!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was supposed to bring the cake!
ФИБИ: Fine, I’ll go call her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
МОНИКА: Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! This looks great!
МОНИКА: Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
ДЖОУИ: And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
МОНИКА: Oh, just until the glue dries.
ДЖОУИ: Thank God!
МОНИКА: Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
ДЖОУИ: Ah.
МОНИКА: Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.
ДЖОУИ: Well maybe we just take that one away.
МОНИКА: I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me. Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
ДЖОУИ: Ow!
МОНИКА: Toothpick?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: What are you trying on now?
ДЖОУИ: The fruit roll up.
МОНИКА: And?
ДЖОУИ: Delicious.
МОНИКА: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
МОНИКА: What?! Which one?!
ДЖОУИ: The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
РОСС: She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
РОСС: Say something clever! Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse! So just say something! II, I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.
МОНИКА: Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
МОНИКА: For what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
ФИБИ: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
МОНИКА: You al-you already had it?
ФИБИ: Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.
ФИБИ: We ruined everything.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh…
МОНИКА: Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you, what do you mean?
МОНИКА: Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don’t even like!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Surprise…
ФИБИ: Sur-surprise.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: …Monica.
ДЖОУИ: And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: My whole family’s from Naples!
НЕДРУГ: Oh that’s great! Okay, well I’ve heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie…
НЕДРУГ: Joey, this is the awkward part.
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that’s me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
ФИБИ: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
ФИБИ: Oh! No problem! I…
НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!
