ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you guys! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what do you think? 
РОСС: About what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, what? 
ДЖОУИ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. 
ДЖОУИ: Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got glasses! 
РОСС: Well, you-you’ve always had glasses. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I didn’t! 
РОСС: Are you sure? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm... 
ДЖОУИ: Feminine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
МОНИКА: Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You didn’t think I used to wear glasses right? 
МОНИКА: Of course! 
ФИБИ: So what do you guys want for an engagement present? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us... 
МОНИКА: If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players. 
МОНИКА: Oh, I already have one. 
ФИБИ: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey. 
МОНИКА: Hey, I know I what I want! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What we want honey. 
МОНИКА: No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe. 
ФИБИ: You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe? 
МОНИКА: Uh-huh, yeah. 
ФИБИ: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dying people say the craziest things. 
МОНИКА: I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children. 
ФИБИ: Break my heart....Oh, all right. 
МОНИКА: Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they. 
ДЖОУИ: Ahoy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! How’s the boat?! 
ДЖОУИ: Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff. 
МОНИКА: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there! 
ФИБИ: If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want. 
ДЖОУИ: You could? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat. 
ФИБИ: Your own boat? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you know what I was thinkin’? 
МОНИКА: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing, I just like to go like this. 
РОСС: Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh why, do you have a lecture? 
РОСС: No, why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then free as a bird. What’s up? 
РОСС: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us. 
МОНИКА: Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play. 
РОСС: Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, did-did you correct him? 
РОСС: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way. 
МОНИКА: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week. 
РОСС: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too. 
МОНИКА: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: He hates to lose. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand. 
РОСС: You’re not a lefty? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does anybody know me?! 
МОНИКА: What’s wrong Phoebe? 
ФИБИ: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up! 
МОНИКА: No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!! 
ФИБИ: Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present. 
РОСС: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don’t worry about it Pheebs. 
РОСС: No one got me an engagement present. 
ФИБИ: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: An old cookie? 
МОНИКА: This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts! 
ФИБИ: See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We can’t accept this. 
ФИБИ: Why not? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ‘Cause it’s gross. 
МОНИКА: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time. 
ФИБИ: Really?! 
МОНИКА: Yeah! I bet I can do it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, we owe you a present. 
РОСС: Two! I’ve been engaged twice! 
ДЖОУИ: Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is the Coast Guard. 
ДЖОУИ: What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet. 
ДЖОУИ: All right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready? 
ДЖОУИ: Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what’s this called? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, boat rope. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, rub it? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about? 
ДЖОУИ: I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Time’s up, now your dead. 
ДЖОУИ: And deaf! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?! 
ДЖОУИ: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler. 
МОНИКА: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. 
ФИБИ: You do? 
МОНИКА: You don’t? Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman. 
ФИБИ: That and arrogance. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey! How was sailing? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. 
НЕДРУГ: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Women are mean!!! 
ФИБИ: I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage. 
РОСС: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey! How was it? 
РОСС: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad. 
РОСС: And what did he ask you not to call him? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys? 
РОСС: Over here. 
НЕДРУГ: Have a seat son. Hey!! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. 
МОНИКА: You gave my father a lap dance! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why do they put so much steam in there?! 
РОСС: ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen? 
ФИБИ: Come on, it’s not that big a deal! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things. 
РОСС: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part? 
МОНИКА: Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t want him to tell this story for years. 
РОСС: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp. 
МОНИКА: I wasn’t escaping. 
РОСС: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire? 
МОНИКА: I was trying to help out a squirrel. 
РОСС: You were trying to eat it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off! 
МОНИКА: Come on. Hello? I’m sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I’m off to see your dad. 
РОСС: Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face...And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. 
РОСС: Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything. 
РОСС: Thank you! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
РОСС: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why not? 
ДЖОУИ: Because! You’re mean on the boat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? I was just trying to teach you. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean! 
РОСС: Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets. 
РОСС: You have to respect the sea! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher. 
ДЖОУИ: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson? 
ДЖОУИ: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom! 
ДЖОУИ: Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling. 
ДЖОУИ: You won’t boss me around anymore? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I won’t boss you around. 
ДЖОУИ: And you’ll be nice? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And, I’ll be nice. 
ДЖОУИ: And you’ll be topless? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And....Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Do you want me to learn?! 
МОНИКА: Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. 
РОСС: Let’s give it a shot. 
МОНИКА: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade. 
ФИБИ: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale? 
МОНИКА: No, just a Friday night. 
РОСС: Ohh, these are pretty good. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. 
РОСС: Which one was that? 
МОНИКА: The ones we had right after you almost threw up. 
РОСС: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I’m okay. 
ФИБИ: Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those. 
РОСС: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side? 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right? 
ДЖОУИ: Nope. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one. 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know why you just don’t say left. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, go to the left. The left! 
ДЖОУИ: Huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just sit over there!! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, come on! We just went over this! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do! 
ДЖОУИ: All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit! 
ДЖОУИ: Why not?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit! 
ДЖОУИ: Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, wait did I...I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? Did I just say Greens don’t quit?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, hey I did learn. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Come on. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awww... 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Left. 
ДЖОУИ: Damnit! 
ФИБИ: Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now. 
РОСС: Looking up? 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah...No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure. 
МОНИКА: Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right. 
РОСС: Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister? 
ФИБИ: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032. 
РОСС: That’s the day you’re gonna die? See...darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day. 
ФИБИ: That’s what you think. 
МОНИКА: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe? 
ФИБИ: Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse. 
МОНИКА: What was her name? 
ФИБИ: Nesele Toulouse. 
МОНИКА: Nestle Tollhouse?! 
ФИБИ: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, is this the recipe? 
ФИБИ: Yes!! Ohh. 
МОНИКА: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time! 
ФИБИ: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little...I’m a little embarrassed about it. 
НЕДРУГ: I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did you do when they found out? 
НЕДРУГ: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh we’re not sailing. 
ДЖОУИ: Just pull on it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches! 
ДЖОУИ: What else? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Here you go. 
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow! 
ДЖОУИ: What are you doing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: What you...don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh whoops. 
ДЖОУИ: Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I’m my dad!
