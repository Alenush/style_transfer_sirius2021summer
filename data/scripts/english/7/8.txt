РОСС: Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no. No-no-no. 
НЕДРУГ: Shhhh! 
РОСС: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes. 
РОСС: What? That's like insanely easy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . 
МОНИКА: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose. 
РОСС: What? You forgot fourteen states? 
МОНИКА: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay, time's up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, I got 48. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in vegetables, Joey? 
ДЖОУИ: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. 
РОСС: Wow, how many have you got? 
ДЖОУИ: Fifty-six! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How come we have one extra place setting? 
МОНИКА: 'Cause you invited your assistant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. 
МОНИКА: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. 
МОНИКА: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do. 
ФИБИ: Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that. 
РОСС: Done! With time a-to-spare. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oooh that may be a New World's record 
РОСС: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. 
РОСС: What? That's impossible. 
ДЖОУИ: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? 
МОНИКА: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up! 
РОСС: No, just give me another minute. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. 
РОСС: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, but if you can't...no dinner! 
РОСС: You're on! 
ДЖОУИ: All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. 
МОНИКА: Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work? 
ДЖОУИ: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? 
МОНИКА: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? 
РОСС: Pshhshhh! 
МОНИКА: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. 
ДЖОУИ: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. 
ФИБИ: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. 
РОСС: Phoebe, why is your bag moving? 
ФИБИ: Oh, it's not! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Seriously, it's moving! 
ДЖОУИ: What the hell is in there? 
ФИБИ: It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. 
МОНИКА: Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something. 
МОНИКА: That's my pie! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which smells delicious! 
МОНИКА: Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! 
ФИБИ: Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help? 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? 
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, who's this? 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! 
ФИБИ: No, there's no dog here? 
МОНИКА: Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. 
ФИБИ: Oh my god! Where are you? 
МОНИКА: I'll be right there! 
ФИБИ: They're here already? How are they doing this? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Tag! What are you doing here? 
НЕДРУГ: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend? 
НЕДРУГ: We kinda broke up this morning. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio. 
РОСС: Ohio!! Thank you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh! Where is the dog?! 
РОСС: What dog? There-there's no dog here. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah that dog left! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! 
ФИБИ: There's no dog in here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! 
ФИБИ: No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is it doing here? 
ФИБИ: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people? 
МОНИКА: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! 
ФИБИ: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? 
МОНИКА: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it still has to go, right? 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, it's um... 
ДЖОУИ: Don't do it! 
МОНИКА: Don't do what? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ФИБИ: Are you crazy? 
РОСС: Are you out of your mind? 
ФИБИ: Why? 
ДЖОУИ: Told ya. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. 
РОСС: Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is there a puppy here? 
НЕДРУГ: You don't like puppies? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, you are new! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream. 
ФИБИ: You don't like ice cream? 
РОСС: It's too cold. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. 
РОСС: It hurts my teeth. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!! 
РОСС: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s. 
МОНИКА: 1250. 
РОСС: Damn, I forgot you were here. 
ФИБИ: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? 
ФИБИ: Oh, I'd say about a month. 
МОНИКА: Really? I'd say 3 to 4. 
ДЖОУИ: Half hour. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Interesting. 
МОНИКА: When it's your assistant, I would say never. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. A moo-point? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense? 
МОНИКА: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. 
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How are you holding up? 
НЕДРУГ: Not bad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So were you guys together a long time? 
НЕДРУГ: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now that she broke up with you? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Hmmmm. 
НЕДРУГ: It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because, uh...it has to. 
НЕДРУГ: You have all the answers, don't you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, thanks for talking to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! 
ДЖОУИ: All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay... 
НЕДРУГ: What did Joey say? I like you back? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Right there! That's my car! Hey!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? 
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe this! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay. 
МОНИКА: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. 
ФИБИ: Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. 
МОНИКА: Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay. 
МОНИКА: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her! 
ФИБИ: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know. 
МОНИКА: That's not gonna work. 
ФИБИ: I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart. 
МОНИКА: Hey! I didn't know either. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I knew. 
ФИБИ: Where's Chandler? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here I am. 
ФИБИ: Wash your hands!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How did you...know? 
РОСС: Hey! What's she doing back here? 
МОНИКА: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! 
РОСС: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically... 
ФИБИ: No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. 
РОСС: Yeah, but, but look what I'm... 
ФИБИ: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Monica? 
РОСС: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not? 
РОСС: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I, I should go in there. 
РОСС: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not? 
РОСС: Because you sent away the dog! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is ridiculous. 
РОСС: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis....take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. 
ДЖОУИ: So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that doesn't scare you? 
ДЖОУИ: Ross, you need some help? 
РОСС: From you? Yes, please! 
ДЖОУИ: First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up! 
РОСС: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out 
ДЖОУИ: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. 
ФИБИ: Hey, is Chandler here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no he went for a walk. 
ФИБИ: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here! 
ФИБИ: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! 
ДЖОУИ: You think? 
МОНИКА: Hi, honey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. 
МОНИКА: What? Why, why would... 
ФИБИ: Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. 
ФИБИ: We have good news, look whose back! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Clunkers?! Oh my god! 
МОНИКА: That's right, she came back all by herself. 
ФИБИ: It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is so good to see you! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? 
РОСС: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's up to you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi! How are you doing? 
НЕДРУГ: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for having me over, you guys. 
РОСС: Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again? 
НЕДРУГ: Colorado. 
РОСС: Ah, what good are you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It...y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? 
НЕДРУГ: Um, I'm not. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. 
НЕДРУГ: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. 
РОСС: Delaware! Delaware! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. 
РОСС: I want my turkey now! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got it. You got Nevada twice. 
РОСС: I know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
