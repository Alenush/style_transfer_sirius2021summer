МОНИКА: So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six. 
ДЖОУИ: Food? Uh-huh gimme! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding? 
ФИБИ: Since when are you into swing music? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands! 
МОНИКА: Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call? 
МОНИКА: I will. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you want me to call? 
МОНИКА: No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job. 
ФИБИ: What is your job? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Staying out of the way. 
ДЖОУИ: This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? 
МОНИКА: There were only twelve. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, I added three. 
МОНИКА: What are peanut butter fingers?! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah… 
РОСС: Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore. 
НЕДРУГ: Could you guys help me? 
РОСС: Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you. 
НЕДРУГ: It-it’s really heavy. 
РОСС: I got it. So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: I-I am Kristen. 
РОСС: Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime. 
НЕДРУГ: I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over. 
РОСС: Ah. 
НЕДРУГ: But-but this block is like a whole other world. 
РОСС: Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Smooth. 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me? 
РОСС: Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh I’d like that. 
РОСС: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РОСС: Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. 
НЕДРУГ: After you. 
РОСС: Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God! 
ФИБИ: Am I crazy or does this totally go?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You look so beautiful! 
ФИБИ: Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica! 
МОНИКА: This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I’d cry. 
МОНИКА: Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m Megan Bailey. 
МОНИКА: Have you found your dress yet? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one. 
МОНИКА: No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just here to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thanks for the tip. 
МОНИКА: Yeah! So-so when are you getting married? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh I’m not, I just like to try these on. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do the same thing. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m just kidding. I’m getting married July 25th. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m just kidding too. I’m getting married in December. 
НЕДРУГ: So when are you getting married? 
МОНИКА: Oh May 15th. 
НЕДРУГ: Oooh it’s getting close! 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: So uh, who’s your photographer? 
МОНИКА: Jeffery. 
НЕДРУГ: We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did? 
МОНИКА: The best man? Wow! 
НЕДРУГ: I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who’s your band?! 
МОНИКА: Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you’re so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced. 
НЕДРУГ: I own this store. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, does this come in another color or… 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m moving in. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, can I give you a hand? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back. 
ДЖОУИ: Boyfriend? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: Kristen. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again? 
НЕДРУГ: Kristen. 
ДЖОУИ: Got it! So… 
НЕДРУГ: So uh, do you live around here? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll remember that. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh I, I have plans tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: But how about tomorrow? 
ДЖОУИ: Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? 
НЕДРУГ: You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I’ll grab this one. 
НЕДРУГ: What is taking so long?! I mean whatever! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So this is Brooklyn. 
МОНИКА: All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts. When you hear it, come running. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ФИБИ: Got it. 
МОНИКА: All right. 
НЕДРУГ: Here he comes! Hurry! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!! 
МОНИКА: Hey! Don’t be a baby! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well I… 
НЕДРУГ: Let’s go!! 
ФИБИ: Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!! 
МОНИКА: No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don’t crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! I’m sorry, this one’s taken! Whoa! 
МОНИКА: Megan! 
НЕДРУГ: Monica! 
МОНИКА: You came?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: This is my dress! 
НЕДРУГ: No! 
МОНИКА: Yes it is! You saw me wearing it! 
НЕДРУГ: And now you’ll see me buying it. 
МОНИКА: What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me! 
НЕДРУГ: Look, you don’t want to fight me. 
МОНИКА: Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! 
ФИБИ: I’m coming! I’m coming! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress? 
ФИБИ: Did you find the dress? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy! 
ФИБИ: I—We gotta get Monica. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! You gotta hold my hand!! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me! 
МОНИКА: Go! Go! Go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey… 
МОНИКА: NOW!!!!!!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet? 
РОСС: Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh. 
РОСС: Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay! 
ДЖОУИ: Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Right across the street? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When’d you meet her? 
ДЖОУИ: Two days ago. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah? 
РОСС: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! How’d it go? 
РОСС: Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not too worried about it. 
РОСС: Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name of the girl you’re dating? 
НЕДРУГ: Kristen Lang. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye! 
РОСС: Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her. 
ДЖОУИ: Obviously! So, how do we decide? 
РОСС: Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her… 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her. 
РОСС: That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her… 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction… 
РОСС: Okay, okay. This can go on for a while. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah well we should order some food then. 
РОСС: No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best. 
ДЖОУИ: That sounds fair. 
РОСС: Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street… 
ДЖОУИ: Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. 
РОСС: Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates. 
РОСС: So let’s decide on the spending limit… 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars? 
РОСС: I was thinking more like a hundred. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars? 
МОНИКА: Oh… 
ФИБИ: I know. Hand me a tissue. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re out of Diet Coke. 
МОНИКА: Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh— 
ФИБИ: What?! 
МОНИКА: That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress! 
ФИБИ: Does that mean Carcass is available? 
МОНИКА: What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do? 
ФИБИ: Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it. 
МОНИКА: How? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re out of toilet paper! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! What’s up? 
ДЖОУИ: I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date. 
РОСС: Oh thanks! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. What time are you meeting her? 
РОСС: We have 8:00 reservations at Gramercy Bistro. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed. 
РОСС: I am dressed. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial? 
РОСС: I have an oily T-zone! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers. 
РОСС: That’s right. 
ДЖОУИ: You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed! 
РОСС: Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know! 
РОСС: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know. 
РОСС: Why am I not surprised? 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this! 
РОСС: I don’t think you have much choice. 
ДЖОУИ: Well we’ll see! 
РОСС: Bye-bye! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer? 
РОСС: Yes. Yes. Just here and there . 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, swing music is so out. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you guys talking about? 
МОНИКА: Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I love swing music! 
ФИБИ: Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what is the other reason? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t want to say. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with. 
МОНИКА: Oh crap! 
РОСС: So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! 
РОСС: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Is your back feeling better? 
РОСС: Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasm out of control. 
ДЖОУИ: Kristen? 
НЕДРУГ: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! What are you doing here? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I… 
НЕДРУГ: Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross. 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
РОСС: Hi. It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore. 
НЕДРУГ: Our table will be ready in a couple minutes. 
РОСС: Yeah. So… 
ДЖОУИ: Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! 
РОСС: So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something? 
НЕДРУГ: Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives. 
РОСС: That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman? 
ДЖОУИ: A woman in a man’s body. 
РОСС: Much better. 
ДЖОУИ: So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married? 
РОСС: Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, little Eric. 
РОСС: That’s right! Wait no, Ben. 
ДЖОУИ: So you’ve just married the one time then? 
РОСС: Well umm… 
НЕДРУГ: You’ve been married twice? 
РОСС: Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food? 
НЕДРУГ: You said the waiter ate my crab cake. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian? 
НЕДРУГ: Do you two know each other? 
НЕДРУГ: No. No. 
ДЖОУИ: No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. 
РОСС: Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea? 
ДЖОУИ: Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?! 
РОСС: Hey you leave Marcel out of this! 
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?! 
РОСС: Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?! 
ДЖОУИ: Monkey lover! 
ДЖОУИ: When do you think we lost her? 
РОСС: Probably around gonorrhea. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, honey! I’m home! 
МОНИКА: Don’t come in here! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something? 
МОНИКА: No! We only mess around at his place! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scaring me. So could you come out here please? 
МОНИКА: No, I’m wearing a wedding dress. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great! 
МОНИКА: Yeah but I’m not keeping it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well then why can’t I see it? 
МОНИКА: Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. Wow! You-you look…hideous. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you have to return it? 
МОНИКА: Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you! 
МОНИКА: Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
МОНИКА: Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought you were gonna be gone all day. 
МОНИКА: Alright, what’s going on? 
МОНИКА: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. 
РОСС: Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Y’know, she could use a little… Oh nice shot!!!
