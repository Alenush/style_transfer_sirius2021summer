ДЖОУИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: What are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
ДЖОУИ: Why would you want to do that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
ДЖОУИ: Rach, there is a decent place to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
ДЖОУИ: No. No. No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No?
ДЖОУИ: No. Rosita does not move.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry, Rosita? As in.
ДЖОУИ: As in Rosita does not move.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
ДЖОУИ: The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Stevie the TV?
ДЖОУИ: Is there a problem?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
РОСС: Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, This is my brother-in-law Ross. Not, My friend Ross, brother-in-law Ross. That’s weird isn’t it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Couldn’t I just say, This is Ross?
РОСС: Sure, do whatever you want.
МОНИКА: Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section.
РОСС: Yeah?
МОНИКА: Look at this.
РОСС: Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is. Oh my God!
ФИБИ: What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
МОНИКА: I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!
РОСС: I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
ФИБИ: I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!
РОСС: Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we’re surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
ДЖОУИ: I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, come on. Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.
ДЖОУИ: She’s not even cold yet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put. your comfort first.
ДЖОУИ: That’s true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay? You ready?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I. I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.
РОСС: I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.
МОНИКА: Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.
РОСС: They kept your room for a while.
МОНИКА: Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!
РОСС: Come on, you know they love you.
МОНИКА: As much as they love you?
РОСС: I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.
ФИБИ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Ugh, I hate this year!
РОСС: What’s wrong with this year?
ФИБИ: Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
МОНИКА: That was me and Ross.
ФИБИ: Oh that’s right!
РОСС: Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
МОНИКА: Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.
ФИБИ: Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much.
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, like you never called!
НЕДРУГ: So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
ФИБИ: Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
НЕДРУГ: Why don’t we do a trial run.
ФИБИ: Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
НЕДРУГ: I’m the supply manager.
ФИБИ: Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
НЕДРУГ: We don’t need any toner.
ФИБИ: Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you’re right, this is easy.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, what was wrong with that call?
ФИБИ: Oh well, all right um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
НЕДРУГ: They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
ФИБИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
ФИБИ: No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
РОСС: Dad?
НЕДРУГ: I’m here!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
РОСС: Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
НЕДРУГ: Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
РОСС: Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.
МОНИКА: Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
МОНИКА: I used to love to play restaurant.
РОСС: Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
МОНИКА: Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
НЕДРУГ: So, I think your boxes are over here.
РОСС: Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know. They-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her. I’ll throw these away.
РОСС: Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym. Oooh, my rock polisher!
НЕДРУГ: Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit!
РОСС: It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!
НЕДРУГ: Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: Y’know how the garage floods every Spring?
РОСС: How are you ever going to sell this place?
НЕДРУГ: I think I accidentally used Monica’s boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
РОСС: Oh no. Dad! Dad! What. Oh God everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!
НЕДРУГ: You don’t secretly smoke do you?
РОСС: No!
НЕДРУГ: So it’s just your mother then.
ФИБИ: Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs.
НЕДРУГ: I don’t need any toner.
ФИБИ: I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
НЕДРУГ: Not me.
ФИБИ: May I ask why?
НЕДРУГ: You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
ФИБИ: I surely do!
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself.
ФИБИ: Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?
НЕДРУГ: Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
ФИБИ: No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
НЕДРУГ: Well. I only have one thing to do today. I guess I could push it back.
ФИБИ: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
НЕДРУГ: It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
ФИБИ: Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: II’m sorry?
ФИБИ: No look, II’m sure that people know you exist!
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I’m gonna kill myself! I’ll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You will like it!
ДЖОУИ: No I won’t.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You don’t even know!
ДЖОУИ: Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well look, if you don’t like this.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know why you say that so soon.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
ДЖОУИ: Francette? What is she? A couch?
ДЖОУИ: Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. She’s heeled!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s weird.
ДЖОУИ: No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.
ДЖОУИ: Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, I really don’t.
ДЖОУИ: Can you tell me how this happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well no.
ДЖОУИ: Miracle!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
ДЖОУИ: Someone like an. angel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
ДЖОУИ: Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
НЕДРУГ: Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose.
РОСС: Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
РОСС: Well, can you blame her?
НЕДРУГ: Well I don’t know, II suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could.
РОСС: Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
РОСС: Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab, grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in there.
НЕДРУГ: Great!
РОСС: Like uh y’know like this! This! She she could’ve made this!
НЕДРУГ: Sure!
РОСС: Right? And this! She-she could’ve won this!
НЕДРУГ: This could’ve been hers!
РОСС: Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
НЕДРУГ: Your make-up kit? I’d feel better.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, me too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, how’s how’s the uh, miracle chair?
ДЖОУИ: Fine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
ДЖОУИ: No. Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
ДЖОУИ: My chair heels itself.
ФИБИ: Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
НЕДРУГ: Hey guy!
ФИБИ: Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
НЕДРУГ: No! That’s just the Hey Guy guy. He says that to everybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me!
ФИБИ: All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Right!
ФИБИ: Oh sorry, boyfriend!
НЕДРУГ: Oh no.
ФИБИ: No, whatever! Anything!
НЕДРУГ: Hey guy!
ФИБИ: Yeah, he’s gotta go.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
ФИБИ: No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!
НЕДРУГ: The new girl’s good.
МОНИКА: Hey guys! Hey!
РОСС: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
НЕДРУГ: That’s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
РОСС: Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
МОНИКА: Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
РОСС: Well, these. These are yours right here.
МОНИКА: Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
РОСС: Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
МОНИКА: Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
РОСС: Nu-uh!
МОНИКА: Oh, an old glove?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
МОНИКА: Wow! Look at this! I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt! Oh, this is yours.
РОСС: Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.
МОНИКА: This isn’t mine. Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
РОСС: Umm, your boxes are umm.
МОНИКА: What?
РОСС: Dad?
НЕДРУГ: Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I’m sorry.
МОНИКА: Just mine?
НЕДРУГ: I’m afraid so.
МОНИКА: So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
МОНИКА: So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!
НЕДРУГ: There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
МОНИКА: I can’t believe this!
НЕДРУГ: Screw it! I’m having one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just purchased the LaZBoy E-cliner 3000.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo! Angels.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m gettin’ my chair back!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Wh-hey!
ДЖОУИ: Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey you broke my chair!
ДЖОУИ: Your chair?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
ДЖОУИ: So, there was no miracle?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Joe, no miracle.
ДЖОУИ: Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think I should get the chair!
ДЖОУИ: How do you figure?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, where’s the logic in that?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
ДЖОУИ: That’s right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! We are!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We’re the Cobras!
ФИБИ: Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, I don’t know any Earl.
НЕДРУГ: I’m right here!
ФИБИ: Earl! I’m Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
ФИБИ: Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.
НЕДРУГ: Look, um I really appreciate your coming down.
ФИБИ: No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!
НЕДРУГ: Why?!
ФИБИ: Because it was fate that made me call you today!
НЕДРУГ: I thought it was toner.
ФИБИ: No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
НЕДРУГ: Really?!
ФИБИ: Yes.
НЕДРУГ: How?
ФИБИ: I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
НЕДРУГ: Couldn’t it just be a coincidence?
ФИБИ: No, it’s fate!
НЕДРУГ: It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate.
ФИБИ: Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
НЕДРУГ: I’m actually the office manager.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, PEarl.
НЕДРУГ: Well, was there anything else?!
ФИБИ: Sure! Umm, where are you from?
НЕДРУГ: Philadelphia.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve gotI’ve got goose bumps.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah-yeah.
ФИБИ: But if no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
НЕДРУГ: Did you hear that?! I don’t need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.
ФИБИ: Y’know, I don’tI don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it’s you.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don’t even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft. What do you think this is?
РОСС: All right. I think it was a mouse.
НЕДРУГ: How are you honey?
МОНИКА: How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
НЕДРУГ: Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I’m sorry about everything that happened and I’d probably never be able to make it up to you, but here’s a start.
МОНИКА: What’s this?
НЕДРУГ: It’s the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
МОНИКА: What?!
РОСС: What?!
НЕДРУГ: I’ve been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother’s right, I do look like an ass.
МОНИКА: Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!
РОСС: Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
НЕДРУГ: Why don’t we take it for a spin?
МОНИКА: All right!
РОСС: Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahhhh!
ДЖОУИ: Ahhh. Eh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: Hey guys!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
МОНИКА: Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever!
