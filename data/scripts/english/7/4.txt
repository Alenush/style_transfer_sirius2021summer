НЕДРУГ: Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don’t mix. 
НЕДРУГ: You can say that again Mac. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00? 
ДЖОУИ: So, what did you guys think?

РОСС: Ohhhh... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s nice. 
ДЖОУИ: Mom, so what did you think? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well that was umm...Okay. 
РОСС: It wasn’t the best. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV. 
МОНИКА: Wh-what are we gonna tell him? 
РОСС: Well, the lighting was okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine! 
МОНИКА: And I have costumes. 
РОСС: Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you gonna do Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I...no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And say nothing? 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, yeah that’s right. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn’t that good. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you? 
ФИБИ: What? You mean behind my back? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and... 
ДЖОУИ: You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me!

ДЖОУИ: I’m gonna be on two TV shows! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that’s great!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you weren’t finished? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s the same story. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow, it’s really long. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.

ФИБИ: Oh God! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got...I get a big pay raise! 
ФИБИ: Oh hey! 
ДЖОУИ: I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother, Stryker! 
МОНИКА: Oooh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I get to hire my own assistant! 
НЕДРУГ: Ahhh!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well...I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you were at this job for four years? 
НЕДРУГ: That’s right. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay? 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing. 
НЕДРУГ: No dear. It’s not. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you! Good meeting you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. I’m a total pro! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall. 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I’m here about the assistant job. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what’s...what is...what’s your name? 
НЕДРУГ: Tag Jones. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh, go on. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s it. That’s my whole name. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. 
НЕДРУГ: I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on! 
НЕДРУГ: It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, hold on just a second. I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no. Hey! 
ФИБИ: Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye. 
МОНИКА: Hey sweetie. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering? 
МОНИКА: I can’t tell you. It’s a secret. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. 
МОНИКА: Awww. But still no. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you. 
МОНИКА: Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no, I can’t do that. 
МОНИКА: If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God. He threw up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe’s secret? 
МОНИКА: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that? 
МОНИКА: That’s right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, you have an assistant right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do. 
ФИБИ: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty! 
ФИБИ: Let’s see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that... it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey-hey-hey Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Terry! 
НЕДРУГ: Good to see you again! 
ДЖОУИ: It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s a different building. 
ДЖОУИ: So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start? 
НЕДРУГ: Why don’t we start right now! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Here are the audition scenes. 
ДЖОУИ: Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part. 
НЕДРУГ: Why would you think that? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right? 
НЕДРУГ: Everybody has to audition. 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry Joey that’s...that’s the way it is. 
ДЖОУИ: Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? This is one star who’s hoop... This is a star that the hoop...this hoop...I was Dr. Drake Remoray! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Tag. What are you doing here? 
НЕДРУГ: I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kinda. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-ohh, thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well... 
НЕДРУГ: Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I hired you! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant! 
НЕДРУГ: I am?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: I can’t believe it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey! Good, you’re home! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh it’s always nicer to hear than, "Aw crap! You again!" 
МОНИКА: Hey baby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
МОНИКА: I made you a surprise. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you not understand the story? 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! What’s up? 
МОНИКА: Ross! 
РОСС: Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Huh. 
РОСС: Hey...Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Shhh! 
РОСС: What you got over there? Tacos? 
МОНИКА: No! No. They’re umm... They’re just uh...ground beef smileys. 
РОСС: Uhh, those are tacos. 
МОНИКА: Excuse me Mr. Mexico. 
РОСС: Eh, either way I’ll pass. I still can’t eat those. What’s so funny?! 
МОНИКА: I’m not laughing. 
РОСС: You told her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! 
РОСС: Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like...It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!" 
МОНИКА: You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! 
РОСС: How could you tell her?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another! 
РОСС: Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Du-ude! 
МОНИКА: What happened in Atlantic City?! 
РОСС: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!" 
РОСС: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls. 
МОНИКА: You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. 
РОСС: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? 
РОСС: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ФИБИ: Hey...Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes. 
ДЖОУИ: Was she happy you gave her the job? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant. 
ДЖОУИ: Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week’s script. Canceled?! Like they’re taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E! 
ФИБИ: Sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers! 
РОСС: All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross came in forth and cried! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! 
РОСС: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too! 
МОНИКА: I-I already told him everything! You shush!! 
РОСС: Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made. 
МОНИКА: Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls! 
РОСС: Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13! 
МОНИКА: It’s hard for some people! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course it is. Wow...whoa! 
МОНИКА: Chandler one time wore my underwear to work! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!!! 
МОНИКА: Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross! 
РОСС: Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was you! 
РОСС: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy. 
ДЖОУИ: How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there. 
ФИБИ: What happened? 
ДЖОУИ: Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, why would you do that? 
ДЖОУИ: Because they wanted me to audition! 
ФИБИ: You! An actor?! That’s madness! 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel Green’s office. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Tag? Hi, who was that? 
НЕДРУГ: Nobody. I was just practicing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Rachel Green’s office. 
ФИБИ: You must be Hilda. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second? 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe! That’s a great name. 
ФИБИ: Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. We’ll be right back. 
ФИБИ: So you hired yourself a little treat did ya? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you... 
ФИБИ: But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Cute assistant! What’s his story? Is he... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gay? Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Terry. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey Tribbiani! I’m surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Wait! Terry! Wait...Look..Wait I-I....Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance. 
НЕДРУГ: I can’t help you Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake. 
НЕДРУГ: This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes. 
НЕДРУГ: Good morning. Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me? 
НЕДРУГ: And cut! 
ДЖОУИ: I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha! 
МОНИКА: Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue. 
РОСС: And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have no trouble telling time now right? 
МОНИКА: No! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Quick! What time is it?! 
МОНИКА: I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets? 
МОНИКА: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that. 
МОНИКА: Ohh, absolutely. 
РОСС: And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, definitely! 
РОСС: Okay, if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story. 
МОНИКА: Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe. 
РОСС: Man! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with...all the guys in my office. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Do you have a minute? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well yeah, sure, what’s up? 
НЕДРУГ: I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh really?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, did you not want people to know that? 
НЕДРУГ: But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why’s that? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think I should say. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ‘Kay. 
НЕДРУГ: Well... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, she’s gay.
