НЕДРУГ: I’m ready! 
РОСС: You sure? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks daddy. 
РОСС: No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Okay. 
РОСС: Yes! Yes! Yes!! 
ФИБИ: His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting! 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: I never had a bike of my own. 
РОСС: What?! 
ФИБИ: Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one. 
РОСС: Ohh. 
МОНИКА: Did the girl ever let you ride it? 
ФИБИ: No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard. 
РОСС: That is so unfair! 
ФИБИ: Not really, I got to drag him around too! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! What are you guys doing? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Making holiday candy for the neighbors. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry, who? 
МОНИКА: I’m gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But we don’t know the neighbors. 
ДЖОУИ: I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty. 
МОНИКА: See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gooood morning!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh, somebody’s in a good mood! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job! 
МОНИКА: Where you can make out with your assistant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem. 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, what’s the plan? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We... We are not... going to let it...be a problem. 
МОНИКА: Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know, we did other stuff too. 
МОНИКА: Did you two... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date! 
МОНИКА: Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anymore!! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, at 4:00. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. 
НЕДРУГ: I’d better get back to my desk. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation. 
НЕДРУГ: My what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. 
НЕДРУГ: Are you serious? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up? 
МОНИКА: The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, either that or uh... 
МОНИКА: Joey!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Did you eat all the neighbor candy?! 
ДЖОУИ: Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it! 
МОНИКА: They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it. 
МОНИКА: Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!! 
РОСС: Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second. 
ФИБИ: Sure! 
РОСС: Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so... 
ФИБИ: Oh my God Ross!! 
РОСС: You like it? 
ФИБИ: I love it!! 
РОСС: Yeah? 
ФИБИ: Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you! 
РОСС: Ahh. 
ФИБИ: Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer! 
РОСС: Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride. 
ФИБИ: Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten. 
РОСС: You’re welcome. 
ФИБИ: Oh and Chandler’s about to cry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Am not! 
МОНИКА: Who is that?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please? 
НЕДРУГ: My name is Gary, I live upstairs. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Hi. Do you know what time it is? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven. 
МОНИКА: Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: 4:00 A.M. 
НЕДРУГ: So, can I get some candy? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us. 
МОНИКА: Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning. 
НЕДРУГ: Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building? 
МОНИКА: Um-hmm. 
НЕДРУГ: Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mm! Night Gar’! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So did you read your evaluation yet? 
НЕДРУГ: No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you! 
НЕДРУГ: A joke they would appreciate? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m thinkin’ no. 
НЕДРУГ: What did you say?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie. 
НЕДРУГ: No, not my touchie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch. 
МОНИКА: Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried. 
ДЖОУИ: Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic! 
ДЖОУИ: Those two only had each other! 
РОСС: Phoebe really likes the bike huh? 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park. 
РОСС: Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: Oh hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! So are you enjoying the bike? 
ФИБИ: Ohh, uh-huh so much! 
РОСС: Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don’t you? 
ФИБИ: Of course! 
МОНИКА: Umm, can we see you ride it? 
ФИБИ: Okay. See? 
МОНИКА: See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened? I’m just eating candy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah? 
ДЖОУИ: That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Joey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is the matter with you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! 
ДЖОУИ: Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! I’m sorry, I know it’s after hours but I really need candy. 
МОНИКА: I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? Rules are rules. 
НЕДРУГ: Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy! 
МОНИКА: No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em? 
НЕДРУГ: I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable! 
МОНИКА: Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever. 
НЕДРУГ: Please, can’t you help me out? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler, do we know that lady? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud? 
МОНИКА: All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that’s her. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. 
МОНИКА: It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what would work? 
МОНИКА: Hmm? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop making candy! 
МОНИКА: But they like it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean they like you. 
МОНИКА: Maybe. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you? 
МОНИКА: Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? 
РОСС: Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set... 
ФИБИ: Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat...or a beanbag chair! 
РОСС: Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike! 
ФИБИ: Why? Why do I have to learn? 
РОСС: Well...In-in case of emergency. 
ФИБИ: What kind of an emergency? 
РОСС: Well let there...what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh...I’ll shoot you." 
ФИБИ: Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star. 
РОСС: Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and...Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay? 
ФИБИ: You won’t let go? 
РОСС: No! 
ФИБИ: Swear?! 
РОСС: I swear! 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РОСС: Come on. All right, here we go. All right? 
ФИБИ: All right. 
РОСС: All right. Feel good? 
ФИБИ: Well... 
РОСС: All right, try pedaling. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РОСС: That’s it, your doing great. 
ФИБИ: Okay. 
РОСС: Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes! 
ФИБИ: Weee!!! 
РОСС: Yes!! Yes!!! 
ФИБИ: Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore! 
РОСС: I-I just thought you were doing so well. I... 
ФИБИ: I am shocked! Shocked!! 
РОСС: It’s a legitimate learning technique. Wow! 
РОСС: Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy. 
МОНИКА: Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!! 
РОСС: Need some help? 
МОНИКА: No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system! 
РОСС: By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. 
ФИБИ: Oh, hello liar. 
РОСС: Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike. 
ФИБИ: I could’ve been killed I hope you know! 
РОСС: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. 
РОСС: Phoebe. 
ФИБИ: What?! What the hell?! 
РОСС: All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back. 
ФИБИ: What?! Why?! 
РОСС: Because! Because, it-it-it’s... It’d be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! The bike is dying. 
ФИБИ: All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. 
РОСС: Great! Great! You’re making the bike very happy. 
ФИБИ: Okay Ross! Please don’t die! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s kinda sad. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office. 
НЕДРУГ: Got it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let’s roll! 
НЕДРУГ: Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything... minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well... 
НЕДРУГ: Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that evaluation. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny. 
НЕДРУГ: You wrote that you have a cute touchie? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda strangely proud of my butt. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can’t figure out what this is? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re lookin’ at it upside down...y’know what? It doesn’t matter. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you’ve got my fax number. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet. 
НЕДРУГ: No, don’t worry about it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you could’ve lost your job. 
НЕДРУГ: Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! You’re great! 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know what? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
НЕДРУГ: I feel great. In fact! What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I... It just...it took me so long to get that desk organized. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I’m sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There it is. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is going on? 
НЕДРУГ: We’re waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah lady! Give us candy!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: What’s up buddy? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing? 
ДЖОУИ: Waiting for candy. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas. 
МОНИКА: Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool! 
НЕДРУГ: We want candy! We want candy now! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right? 
НЕДРУГ: Candy Lady? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No not Candy Lady. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it! 
ДЖОУИ: That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! 
МОНИКА: Thank you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re welcome. 
МОНИКА: Did you smoke? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh...are you okay? 
МОНИКА: I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know... 
ФИБИ: I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross. 
РОСС: Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them. 
ФИБИ: Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special.
