МОНИКА: I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh... 
РОСС: What’s the matter? You okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it’s just y’know... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica said wedding. 
МОНИКА: Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I would love to read a poem. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you think you could get through a poem? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’ll be a short one. 
МОНИКА: Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh... 
РОСС: Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Too? 
РОСС: Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys. 
МОНИКА: Do you mind telling us what it is? 
РОСС: Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and... 
МОНИКА: What is DOOL? 
ДЖОУИ: Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s great! 
ДЖОУИ: And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So great things are happening at work and in your personal life! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. 
РОСС: What? A brain transplant?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure. 
РОСС: It’s ridiculous! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months. 
РОСС: It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. 
МОНИКА: Who are they killing off? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart. 
НЕДРУГ: Noo!! 
МОНИКА: She’s my favorite character on DOOL. 
ДЖОУИ: Nice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage. 
МОНИКА: And the way she slaps all the time! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! 
МОНИКА: Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don’t do it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. 
РОСС: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her? 
ДЖОУИ: Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist! 
ФИБИ: Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I'd have to say gay. 
ФИБИ: Yeah? Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy. 
ФИБИ: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight. 
ФИБИ: Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, straight, and not subtle. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, he left his cell phone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found. 
ФИБИ: Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. 
ФИБИ: Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story? 
ФИБИ: I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, you had a date three days ago. 
ФИБИ: That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone. 
ФИБИ: No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again. 
ФИБИ: Nice try. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone? 
ФИБИ: I don’t know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!! 
ФИБИ: Ah-ha! Too cocky! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes there is! 
НЕДРУГ: What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?! 
НЕДРУГ: That was an accident! And so were you. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, at least I’m not a murderer! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my baby! 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! 
ДЖОУИ: That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, just years of experience. 
НЕДРУГ: Can I get some ice here?! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are. 
НЕДРУГ: You’re not the fan who’s dying are you? 
ДЖОУИ: Say what? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but that’s not supposed to be until later! 
ДЖОУИ: No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh that was a real person?! 
ДЖОУИ: An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me.... 
НЕДРУГ: I-I-I’m leaving the show? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something? 
НЕДРУГ: Who told you that? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, one of the writers. 
НЕДРУГ: Which one? Was it bald or was it tall? 
ДЖОУИ: Umm.... 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I’ve been playing for 20 years...I’ll give you a tip! 
ДЖОУИ: Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone. 
ФИБИ: Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t think so. 
ФИБИ: Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, first name on the speed dial is mom. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. 
ФИБИ: Did I use that already today? I’m sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes okay. Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! That’s a steak house! 
ФИБИ: Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial. 
ФИБИ: So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: His new girlfriend! 
МОНИКА: What is that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it’s the dying cat parade. 
МОНИКА: It sounds like it’s coming from across the street. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half Scottish right?" 
МОНИКА: Nooo!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes!! 
МОНИКА: No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why is your family Ross?! 
МОНИКА: He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How are ya? 
ФИБИ: Good. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, now you lost me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You stole the phone! 
ФИБИ: No I didn’t! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring? 
ФИБИ: No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: That is a different phone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It’s for me! 
ФИБИ: That is damning evidence. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It’s Rach... Would you stop doing that?! 
ФИБИ: Hello? Yes, I’m the one who found your phone. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! You can’t do th.... 
ФИБИ: Shhh! I’m on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. Bye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You do know that I will be here when he comes over. 
ФИБИ: Oh? And how will you know what time to come over? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You just said it! 
ФИБИ: Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: What?! That’s the first time today! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! 
ДЖОУИ: So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to... 
НЕДРУГ: I’m 16. 
ДЖОУИ: See you in 2003. 
НЕДРУГ: You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently it's going to be very soon and that’s it. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, thanks. 
ДЖОУИ: No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again? 
ДЖОУИ: Joey. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. 
НЕДРУГ: It wasn’t my decision! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m having a conversation here! You were saying? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye...l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please? 
НЕДРУГ: All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much! 
НЕДРУГ: You’re so welcome. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? "Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again! Ever!!" 
НЕДРУГ: Is that supposed to be me? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent. 
ДЖОУИ: I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my résumé! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I feel like a snack! 
МОНИКА: Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no thanks. I don’t like anything from my Scottish heritage. 
РОСС: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. 
РОСС: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots. 
МОНИКА: No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet. 
РОСС: Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more... 
МОНИКА: You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! 
РОСС: How did you know about that?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We heard you play all the way from your apartment! 
РОСС: Were you the ones called the cops?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while] we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. 
РОСС: Why not? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because we hate them. 
РОСС: Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have heard you play. 
РОСС: No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a wee bit o’ celebration. 
НЕДРУГ: So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! All right! 
НЕДРУГ: No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it’s a little weird, but it’s getting better. Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do! I mean, it’s been 20 years of my life. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh well..Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented. 
НЕДРУГ: I am. I am, but I don’t know, you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb...Angelina Jolie! 
НЕДРУГ: I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work! 
ДЖОУИ: Like-like what? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! 
НЕДРУГ: But... Well now, now’s a different time for me. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!" 
НЕДРУГ: You think I’m hot? 
ДЖОУИ: You own the room. We should probably get-get uh... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man’s face. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate? 
НЕДРУГ: No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands may be a little off, they should be maybe right like... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Who is it? 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! It’s Tom, I’m here to pick up the phone. 
ФИБИ: Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well why shouldn’t I?! 
ФИБИ: Because it’s my apartment! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, then I get to give him the cell phone. 
ФИБИ: Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Wow! How long were we arguing for? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re not the man who left the cell phone. 
НЕДРУГ: No that’s my assistant. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is-is he coming? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm, no. 
ФИБИ: Could you-could you umm, give us one second? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We’ll be right back sir. 
НЕДРУГ: Sure. 
ФИБИ: Wh-what do we do? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know! 
ФИБИ: Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! What?! 
ФИБИ: Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no they do but, you just have to wait. 
ФИБИ: Rachel, listen...I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big! 
ФИБИ: Yeah! You’re such a great friend! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh... 
НЕДРУГ: So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh? 
ФИБИ: Oh that’d be me. Sir. After you. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Okay. 
ФИБИ: Nice! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, you certainly own that room. 
ДЖОУИ: Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it’s nice to know that you... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: That uh, that is my roommate Rachel. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh that explains all the women’s underwear. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure. Yep. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favour? 
НЕДРУГ: Certainly. 
МОНИКА: Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! 
НЕДРУГ: I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God. You seem really, really nice. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, bye-bye. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, here we go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you’re a stupid bitch. 
НЕДРУГ: I really can’t slap you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are so beautiful. 
МОНИКА: Nice to meet you! My God you’re great! 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I... 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry about it. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
ДЖОУИ: They sent me today’s script! They never send the script! 
НЕДРУГ: They don’t? 
ДЖОУИ: Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh... 
НЕДРУГ: How does it happen? 
ДЖОУИ: Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah what?! Jessica hates horses! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either. 
РОСС: ...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks. 
РОСС: Do you wanna start telling secrets? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
РОСС: Now umm, remember I’m still learning. 
РОСС: One, two, three, four! 
РОСС: You know the song! Sing along! 
РОСС: So? 
НЕДРУГ: No! 
НЕДРУГ: Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you sweetheart. 
НЕДРУГ: I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t think so. 
НЕДРУГ: Who are you?! 
НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own mother?! 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you! 
НЕДРУГ: That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you’re a better Jessica than I ever was! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh noo... 
НЕДРУГ: Well of course not, but you were very good. 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks! 
НЕДРУГ: And guess what? Good news! I got another job! 
ДЖОУИ: Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?! 
НЕДРУГ: A film in Guadalajara! 
ДЖОУИ: The airport? 
НЕДРУГ: No that’s La Guardia. This is Mexico. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone? 
НЕДРУГ: Eight months. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s a really long time. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there. 
ДЖОУИ: Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again...That is...I tell ya, that is a tricky one! 
НЕДРУГ: That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You’ve, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful. 
ДЖОУИ: Good luck. 
НЕДРУГ: You too. 
РОСС: You know the song! Sing along! 
ФИБИ: Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!! 
НЕДРУГ: Eee!! 
НЕДРУГ: Do it again!
