ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
ДЖОУИ: Dude! What are yo you trying to kill me?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh, what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful.
ФИБИ: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: how about I move in with you?
ФИБИ: Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
МОНИКА: Who’s Denise?
ФИБИ: My roommate.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You have a roommate?!
ФИБИ: Yes, Denise. Denise!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
ФИБИ: Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!
ДЖОУИ: Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that’s true.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
ФИБИ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
РОСС: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
ФИБИ: You didn’t tell her did you?
РОСС: No.
ФИБИ: Of course not, because you’re in love with her.
РОСС: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. II just comforted her, as a friend.
ФИБИ: What do you mean, comforted her?
РОСС: It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.
ФИБИ: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
РОСС: It’s also a sign of friendship.
ФИБИ: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
РОСС: It was a hug!
ФИБИ: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
РОСС: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
ФИБИ: Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.
РОСС: I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
ФИБИ: Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.
РОСС: If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
ФИБИ: Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who was it?
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! How about, Thanks for taking the message. Jeez!
МОНИКА: Okay listen, y’know when you move in, Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure!
МОНИКА: Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for 200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay so you mean no as in, Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.
МОНИКА: Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, that’s it?
МОНИКА: I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
МОНИКА: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
МОНИКА: Are you mocking me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I’m not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what’s up?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
ДЖОУИ: But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. Nice!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I have to ask you.
ФИБИ: Shhh! I’m swamped right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re just staring into space.
ФИБИ: Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This one?
ФИБИ: It worked!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!
ФИБИ: Wait, no, look at this! Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay! Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
РОСС: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! Why?
РОСС: Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s! I love Warren! Thank you!
РОСС: Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here’s Warren’s number.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
РОСС: Okay, you go grab it!
ФИБИ: I saw it.
РОСС: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
ФИБИ: Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again you re-love her!
РОСС: Look, I do not re-love her.
ФИБИ: I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.
РОСС: Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.
РОСС: You can live with me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ФИБИ: What?!
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
РОСС: Uh-huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I would love to live with you Ross that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
РОСС: Well, I’mI’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.
ФИБИ: Wow! I’mI’m so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: RossRoss, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!
РОСС: Hero, I uh, I don’t know well, all right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
РОСС: Oh please! You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?
ФИБИ: No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! Okay, that’s a lie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em. Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women.
МОНИКА: Stop it Chandler. I’m sorry too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
МОНИКА: Yeah! Oh yes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh.
МОНИКА: Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
МОНИКА: Totally!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don’t have to come up with this now.
МОНИКА: Oh good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?
МОНИКА: Changes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
МОНИКА: You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that a problem?
МОНИКА: Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.
МОНИКА: See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
МОНИКА: Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: In the game room!
МОНИКА: Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!
ДЖОУИ: Everything on your application looks really good. Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
НЕДРУГ: Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I’ll be living here.
ДЖОУИ: Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why did you take the shower curtain down?
ДЖОУИ: That thing was a hazard! I’m very safety conscious.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.
РОСС: What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
РОСС: What?! Over a stupid room!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!
РОСС: Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
РОСС: What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
МОНИКА: Ross, we can handle this.
РОСС: Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!
РОСС: Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
МОНИКА: Love is the best medicine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s laughter.
МОНИКА: Why do you do it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know.
РОСС: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I do.
РОСС: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?
МОНИКА: Yes.
РОСС: Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
НЕДРУГ: So I understand you’re looking for a place.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, I’m staying put.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why, where are you going?
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know.
РОСС: Hey Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right? I mean for them. Right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wow.
РОСС: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?
РОСС: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, because of us! Because of our history.
РОСС: No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No?
РОСС: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Not at all!
РОСС: Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
РОСС: Really?! We are?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend.
РОСС: Ohh! That would be great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky.
РОСС: Yeah, I didn’t think of that.
РОСС: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!
МОНИКА: That’s very funny!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
РОСС: No, III’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!
МОНИКА: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
РОСС: Okay, there are no stupid fights! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I'm not so worried.
МОНИКА: Yeah, no, me neither.
РОСС: Fine! It’s your life! I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do. DON’T DO IT!
МОНИКА: You still want to move in together right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course!
МОНИКА: Ross didn’t scare you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
МОНИКА: Come here, I want to show you something!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
МОНИКА: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
МОНИКА: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say Merge?
МОНИКА: Uh-hmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!
МОНИКА: Oh my God! I love that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?!
МОНИКА: Uh, no!
ФИБИ: I found you in my bed! How’d you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair.
ФИБИ: Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
РОСС: So umm, where are the other guys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
РОСС: Fighting?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.
РОСС: Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
РОСС: Sure! Here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back.
РОСС: Yeah, I’mI’m sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
ДЖОУИ: Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
РОСС: I’ve been back and forth.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!
РОСС: Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.
ДЖОУИ: That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone. And then, bamn! She finds you!
РОСС: Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.
ДЖОУИ: I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
РОСС: Is that what I want?
ФИБИ: Yes.
ДЖОУИ: Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.
ДЖОУИ: Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me?
РОСС: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. It’s okay, I mean I, look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.
ДЖОУИ: Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
ДЖОУИ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
НЕДРУГ: Great!
ДЖОУИ: Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
НЕДРУГ: I can do that.
ДЖОУИ: Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
НЕДРУГ: Fight.
ДЖОУИ: Very good! Okay. G.
НЕДРУГ: String?
ДЖОУИ: Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
НЕДРУГ: Kitten?
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but, bye-bye!
