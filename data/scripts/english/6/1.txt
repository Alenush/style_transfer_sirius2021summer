ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married! 
МОНИКА: Are you sure you wanna do this? 
РОСС: Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait! Okay! 
МОНИКА: Whoa!

ФИБИ: Hey! Don’t you give me any of your...Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: What are you guys doing here? 
ДЖОУИ: Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Well that-yes. 
МОНИКА: Why else would we be here? 
ДЖОУИ: Well! What happened?! Did we miss it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We actually missed it. 
ФИБИ: Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you run in the chapel! 
МОНИКА: This is insane! 
ФИБИ: What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas. 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere. 
ФИБИ: Really?! 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God!...Eh! Well... 
НЕДРУГ: In case you haven’t heard, Courteney Cox got married to David Arquette during hiatus and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. But David was a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For they’re all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette, and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman Arquette. I just wonder what the new sleeping arrangements are?} 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh! 
РОСС: Why are we in bed together? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on? 
РОСС: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! 
РОСС: No! But we-we didn’t have sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot. 
РОСС: And we didn’t have sex. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid. 
РОСС: Tell me about it. 
ДЖОУИ: Mornin’ Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled. 
ФИБИ: Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast? 
ДЖОУИ: Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight? 
ФИБИ: What about my cab? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t need that anymore. 
ФИБИ: No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back. 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh...ooh! How about you come with me? 
ФИБИ: I don’t know, it’s such a long trip. 
ДЖОУИ: It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship. 
ФИБИ: Are you asking me to have a frenaissance? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure? 
ФИБИ: All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
МОНИКА: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet? 
ФИБИ: Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute. 
ДЖОУИ: Where is the waitress?! I’m starving! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s a buffet man. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, I gotta talk to you. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure! What’s up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica and I almost got married last night. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! That’s huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved. 
МОНИКА: How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore. 
ФИБИ: Well you don’t. 
МОНИКА: Yes I do! 
ФИБИ: Good! Good! I was just testing you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi. 
МОНИКА: Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon. 
ФИБИ: No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. 
РОСС: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night. 
РОСС: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch. 
МОНИКА: Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who got married?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You did. 
РОСС: What?! Hello! We didn’t get married. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous! 
РОСС: We-we-we....I remember being in a chapel. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. 
РОСС: I....They would not let us get married when we were that drunk! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! 
ДЖОУИ: They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk! 
ФИБИ: Hell, I’m drunk right now! What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation! 
МОНИКА: What are you guys gonna do? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free. 
РОСС: Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment. 
ДЖОУИ: An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here. 
ФИБИ: Oh-oh, that’s your thing. 
РОСС: What? 
ФИБИ: You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! 
РОСС: No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced! 
ФИБИ: Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I’m so drunk. 
МОНИКА: So, what do you think we should do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you! 
МОНИКА: I know I love you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you. 
МОНИКА: That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there’s a definite sign that we should get married. 
МОНИКА: All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds great. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please. 
МОНИКА: Ready? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ready! 
МОНИКА: Come on eight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, yes eight. 
НЕДРУГ: Eight! Easy eight. 
МОНИКА: Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess. 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit! 
МОНИКА: I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. We’re doing the right thing, right? 
МОНИКА: Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. 
ФИБИ: Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any QUESTIONS!!! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
ФИБИ: Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper! 
ДЖОУИ: All right. All right. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? I don’t... 
ФИБИ: Sing!! 
ДЖОУИ: I wanna rock and roll all night! 
ДЖОУИ: Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! 
НЕДРУГ: Morning! 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, hubby! 
РОСС: Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. 
РОСС: I’m not going to do that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! So, we’ll just stay married. 
РОСС: Yes, exactly! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! 
РОСС: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding. 
РОСС: I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?! 
РОСС: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me. 
РОСС: I’m asking you to do me a favor. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are asking me to be your wife! 
РОСС: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor. 
МОНИКА: That kid really kicked me hard on the plane. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you did pull his hair. 
МОНИКА: He took my snack! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not getting into this again! 
МОНИКА: Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay. 
МОНИКА: This doesn’t mean anything, does it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ФИБИ: How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape..., a rapist or a killer or something! 
ДЖОУИ: Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?! 
ФИБИ: Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?! 
НЕДРУГ: No! 
ФИБИ: Do you like car games? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, y’know the license plate game? 
ФИБИ: I love the license plate game! 
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play! 
ФИБИ: No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
РОСС: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married. 
РОСС: I don’t know if it’s true. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh b-b-but it is! 
РОСС: Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will! 
РОСС: All right. All right, I’ll do it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower? 
НЕДРУГ: Wait! Wait! There is the train station! 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay. 
НЕДРУГ: This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number. 
ФИБИ: And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court. 
НЕДРУГ: All right, see ya Pheebs. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on! 
ФИБИ: Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice! 
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you. 
ФИБИ: You can still sleep at night and stuff. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas. 
ФИБИ: Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich? 
ДЖОУИ: Yes. 
ФИБИ: Is it a meatball sub? 
ДЖОУИ: That is incredible! You are the master! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the... 
МОНИКА: No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it. 
МОНИКА: I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me too! 
МОНИКА: I don’t want things to change! Do you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! 
МОНИКА: All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here? 
МОНИКА: Then all your stuff would be here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, what if all my stuff was here? 
МОНИКА: Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying? 
МОНИКА: Live together? There have been no signs for that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me asking is kind of a sign. 
МОНИКА: YES!!!!!!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!!!!! 
МОНИКА: Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Here’s your key 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh thanks. 
МОНИКА: Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?! 
МОНИКА: Ready! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in! 
МОНИКА: Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is not a sign! 
МОНИКА: No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s an old key! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God it’s old! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you! 
МОНИКА: I love you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you hugging the door right now. 
МОНИКА: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah-yeah, me neither. 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment? 
РОСС: Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? 
РОСС: Oh yeah, why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs? 
ФИБИ: No thanks, I’ve already seen one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. 
РОСС: Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird? 
ФИБИ: Always. 
РОСС: I didn’t get the annulment. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
РОСС: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. 
ДЖОУИ: What are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The key’s stuck in the lock. 
ДЖОУИ: I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It still doesn’t work. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m not finished. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
