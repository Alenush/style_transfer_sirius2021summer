ДЖОУИ: Great! Roomie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is 400. Thanks a lot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
ДЖОУИ: Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.
ДЖОУИ: All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re jokin’ right?
ДЖОУИ: Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank God you’re pretty.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you guys know any cute guys?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go.
МОНИКА: What’s the charity?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know, something either trees or disease. Ralph mumbles a lot.
МОНИКА: Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
ФИБИ: Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So he has to be a male who has at least 50.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh! So close.
РОСС: Hey everybody!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: I’m the student.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Isn’t she cute? No!
ФИБИ: Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, we’re not together.
РОСС: Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
ФИБИ: Oh, sly.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I’ll see you later?
НЕДРУГ: Okay!
НЕДРУГ: Bye Ross.
РОСС: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
РОСС: Oh that is quite all right ma’am.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
РОСС: Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, tell her good luck with that.
РОСС: Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oo! When’s her birthday?!
РОСС: I don’t know Rachel, why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.
МОНИКА: Oh, I like Elizabeth.
РОСС: Well thanks!
МОНИКА: Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-aLongs.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her?
РОСС: Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
МОНИКА: Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
РОСС: Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are.
ФИБИ: Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
МОНИКА: Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Do we have any Fruit RollUps?
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ФИБИ: Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
ФИБИ: Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would our guy be a weirdo?
ФИБИ: ‘Cause that’s just your taste.
МОНИКА: Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah?
МОНИКА: Yeah!
ФИБИ: My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A face ass?
ФИБИ: A chin dimple!
МОНИКА: Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!
ФИБИ: Have you seen your guy’s body?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, our guy is just a floating head.
ФИБИ: Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
МОНИКА: You’re not supposed to look!
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
ФИБИ: I know.
МОНИКА: All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
ФИБИ: Oh, Chandler funny?
МОНИКА: Our guy’s a great dancer!
ФИБИ: My guy is well read.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our guy has great hair.
ФИБИ: My guy has great teeth!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our guy smells incredible.
МОНИКА: Do you want our guy to be your guy?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Huh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you, don’t look good Joe.
ДЖОУИ: The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes. Hey, what was in that brown jar?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s still in there?!
ДЖОУИ: Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this a service you’re providing me?
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No! For my new fridge our new fridge!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.
ДЖОУИ: So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh.
ДЖОУИ: And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Give me 400!
НЕДРУГ: Professor Geller?
РОСС: Hmm? Oh, a student I don’t know.
НЕДРУГ: I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
РОСС: Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
НЕДРУГ: Making out in your office.
РОСС: Shh! Of course, why don’t we go inside?
РОСС: Oh-ooh!
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Doorknob! Doorknob!
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
РОСС: Oh, okay. What-what about?
НЕДРУГ: Spring vacation.
РОСС: Spring vacation.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips.
НЕДРУГ: Professor Geller!
РОСС: Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger I’ll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
РОСС: You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
РОСС: I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
ДЖОУИ: Or! You can just, y’know.
РОСС: What the hell are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
РОСС: What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be 400!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, I saw you push him!
ДЖОУИ: You pushed him!
РОСС: Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
ДЖОУИ: All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh.
ДЖОУИ: I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.
РОСС: Do not give him any money!
ДЖОУИ: I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
НЕДРУГ: You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
РОСС: Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
РОСС: Oo-oo!
НЕДРУГ: Doorknob?
РОСС: Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
НЕДРУГ: Oh good.
РОСС: Look, I. Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.
РОСС: No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was.
НЕДРУГ: You are so adorable.
РОСС: That! Let’s talk about that.
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
РОСС: Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
РОСС: What’s-what’s the difference?
МОНИКА: Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.
РОСС: Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
ФИБИ: What did you do on yours?
РОСС: I went to Egypt with my dad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can see it now, Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!
РОСС: Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, Spring break! All right? I mean she’s taken my class!
МОНИКА: And slept with the professor.
РОСС: I’m gonna call her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field amp Stream. What? I read that.
НЕДРУГ: Can I get you a cup of coffee?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes! Thank you!
ФИБИ: Rachel, what the hell is this?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You found me a guy?
МОНИКА: Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!
ФИБИ: Yeah and II found you one too who is not a weirdo.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
МОНИКА: Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
НЕДРУГ: Here you go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank you.
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ФИБИ: So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
НЕДРУГ: Uh, no not really. Why?
ФИБИ: No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you funny?
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you guys doing?
МОНИКА: Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
НЕДРУГ: Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
ФИБИ: Well, so do a lot of people.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.
НЕДРУГ: Okay! See you later!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Turns out he is kinda funny.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?
ФИБИ: Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance? Uhh, okay. I gotta go!
МОНИКА: All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
ФИБИ: Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so you will meet our guys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
ДЖОУИ: Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge you owe me 400 bucks!
ФИБИ: Okay sure!
ДЖОУИ: Really?!
ФИБИ: Ooh, technically you owe me 600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
ДЖОУИ: Call it even?
ФИБИ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
РОСС: Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know.
ДЖОУИ: Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know the hotels?
ДЖОУИ: Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!
МОНИКА: In 1981 you were 13!
ДЖОУИ: So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
РОСС: Okay, she can’t go.
ФИБИ: Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.
РОСС: Then what am I supposed to do?
ФИБИ: Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
РОСС: Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.
РОСС: I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! I’ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y’know, blow off some steam.
РОСС: Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey II know another great way to blow off steam.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Are you into crafts at all?
НЕДРУГ: Ross, are you okay?
РОСС: Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what’s this?
НЕДРУГ: It’s a bathing suit?
РОСС: To wear in front of people?
НЕДРУГ: Is that supportive?
РОСС: Is this?!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Good-good-good-good.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
МОНИКА: We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
МОНИКА: You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
МОНИКА: Eldad, this is Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: How are you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I. Ohh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There you go! There you are!
МОНИКА: Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
ФИБИ: This is Patrick.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi. Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late they’re sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: This is Patrick.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ФИБИ: Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m just sort of in the middle of something.
ФИБИ: Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. Have a seat.
МОНИКА: No! You can’t do that!
НЕДРУГ: Maybe I should go!
МОНИКА: Sit down! We’re winning!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
МОНИКА: Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is the softest hair! Touch it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I’m good.
ФИБИ: Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
НЕДРУГ: Y’know what Phoebe? This isn’t really worth the free massage.
МОНИКА: That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! What is the matter with you guys?
ФИБИ: Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I. Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
НЕДРУГ: I’m a little embarrassed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
ФИБИ: Then why did she ask us to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am still talking! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y’know. Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
НЕДРУГ: Yes, Papaya Extract.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you!
РОСС: So uh, have a great time down there.
НЕДРУГ: I will.
РОСС: Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, II am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.
РОСС: Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
РОСС: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! I’m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
РОСС: Okay. Cool.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey! Here they are!
НЕДРУГ: Elizabeth!
РОСС: Call me!
ФИБИ: Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So what was it for anyway?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wanna say a disease.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh. All right.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh Professor Geller.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh, to be 13 again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
