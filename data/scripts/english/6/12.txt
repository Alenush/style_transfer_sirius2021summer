РОСС: Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
ФИБИ: I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
РОСС: Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.
МОНИКА: That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.
РОСС: Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
РОСС: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I made that joke up.
РОСС: Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.
РОСС: Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
МОНИКА: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously?
МОНИКА: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
РОСС: Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I guess.
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
РОСС: No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s my joke.
РОСС: It’s my joke.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
ДЖОУИ: Let’s go watch it at your place.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? No, I want to watch this. Did your cable go out?
ДЖОУИ: No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today. It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, why is your cable out?
ДЖОУИ: I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
ДЖОУИ: No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa ho.
ДЖОУИ: I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
ДЖОУИ: Sure.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Paid your phone bill?
ДЖОУИ: Not so much.
ФИБИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: It’s only you.
ФИБИ: Wh-wh-what are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We are looking at a Playboy.
ФИБИ: Oh, I want to look too! Yikes!
МОНИКА: So do you think that these pictures. Are, are they trying to tell a story?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’
МОНИКА: Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy.
МОНИКА: Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t know.
МОНИКА: Me neither.
ФИБИ: Rachel.
МОНИКА: What?!
ФИБИ: I don’t know. Me neither.
ДЖОУИ: You forget how many great songs Heart had.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
РОСС: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.
РОСС: What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
РОСС: Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a cheque for one hundred ah-dollars.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
РОСС: Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
РОСС: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah!
РОСС: Well, I’m not going to go now anyway.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Here you go.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you want, you can work here.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just. Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
ДЖОУИ: What?!
НЕДРУГ: Flexible hours.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
МОНИКА: She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He took my joke, he took it.
МОНИКА: It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
МОНИКА: That’s a good idea.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah!
МОНИКА: Do you know what’s a bad idea?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Picking Rachel.
МОНИКА: That’s right. Did you hear something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
МОНИКА: It’s coming from the living room.
ДЖОУИ: I finished my book.
МОНИКА: Hey, you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, what are you doing?
МОНИКА: Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
ФИБИ: I guess it was kinda funny.
МОНИКА: It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?
ФИБИ: Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re, just kinda high maintenance, okay let’s go to lunch!
МОНИКА: That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!
ФИБИ: No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, people are different.
ФИБИ: Ya, you know, Rachel, she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, you’re not a pushover.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my, you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch.
МОНИКА: You start working on that list.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe her.
МОНИКА: I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
МОНИКА: I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
МОНИКА: All right.
РОСС: Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
РОСС: Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
ДЖОУИ: Sure. Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
МОНИКА: No, thank you.
ДЖОУИ: You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
НЕДРУГ: I’d love an ice water.
ДЖОУИ: You got it.
МОНИКА: Joey, what are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Just being friendly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
ДЖОУИ: Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?
НЕДРУГ: Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
МОНИКА: Joey, do you work here?
ДЖОУИ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, waiter.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
МОНИКА: Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?
ДЖОУИ: It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
ДЖОУИ: I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
РОСС: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.
РОСС: Seriously, II asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
ДЖОУИ: See, now it’s weird again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.
РОСС: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
МОНИКА: Hah!
ФИБИ: That true, I am flaky.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?
ФИБИ: Yeah, totally.
МОНИКА: Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
ФИБИ: That’s great. Good for you guys.
МОНИКА: I am not high maintenance!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am not a pushover!
ФИБИ: Who said you were?
НЕДРУГ: You did!
ФИБИ: Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
НЕДРУГ: No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.
ДЖОУИ: Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’
НЕДРУГ: That’s the whole part?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’
НЕДРУГ: Oh, excuse me.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
НЕДРУГ: I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
ДЖОУИ: So, you’d hire me, right?
НЕДРУГ: For what?
ДЖОУИ: Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
НЕДРУГ: Huh? What?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.
РОСС: It’s my joke.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s my joke.
НЕДРУГ: It’s my joke.
РОСС: Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let’s have Monica decide.
РОСС: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah!
РОСС: Hey Mon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mon, get out here!
РОСС: Monica!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
МОНИКА: Why do I have to decide?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
РОСС: Yeah.
МОНИКА: I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.
РОСС: Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don’t try to sway her. I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.
РОСС: We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth. me.
МОНИКА: Okay, Chandler, you go first.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
МОНИКА: Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I finish my story?!
МОНИКА: Do you want me to pick you?!
РОСС: See, I would never snap at you like that.
МОНИКА: Continue.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
РОСС: Are you kidding? Okay, look. II studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not arguing with that.
МОНИКА: All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.
МОНИКА: You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
РОСС: It’s your joke.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is not.
МОНИКА: Hi, Chandler. There you are.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, oh hi.
МОНИКА: Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and, generosity of spirit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.
ФИБИ: Really? I’ve heard better.
МОНИКА: Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
МОНИКА: Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re a little high maintenance.
МОНИКА: Ahhh! You are on my list.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like, maintaining you.
МОНИКА: I didn’t even tell him to say that. All right you’re off my list.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m off the list.
МОНИКА: Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
ФИБИ: Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?
ДЖОУИ: Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so.
ФИБИ: Wow! That is a bad audition.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How-how did you lose your job here?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him. No, I really shouldn’t say anything. No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
НЕДРУГ: He can have his job back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
ДЖОУИ: That’s great. Thanks Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?
ФИБИ: Rach, you’re in my seat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I’m sorry.
ФИБИ: Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
МОНИКА: I pick you, Phoebe.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
ФИБИ: Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
РОСС: No way.
ДЖОУИ: I’m not answering that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey! No way. I’m not answering that.
