РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!! 
РОСС: Look I was going to tell you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: You’re kidding! 
ФИБИ: Oh my God!! 
МОНИКА: Ross! 
РОСС: Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage? 
РОСС: Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it. 
ФИБИ: Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core! 
РОСС: Phoebe, I told her you already knew. 
ФИБИ: Another lie. You have a sickness! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years! 
ДЖОУИ: Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys? 
МОНИКА: Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found? 
ДЖОУИ: There’s a lost and found? My shoe! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You left a shoe here?! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe. 
ДЖОУИ: Great! Thanks. 
ФИБИ: Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, all right. 
ФИБИ: Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa-whoa-whoa! What? 
ФИБИ: Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself! 
МОНИКА: Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies. 
МОНИКА: Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when......people with babies come to visit. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice car! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it’s not mine. 
НЕДРУГ: I love your car. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, it’s mine. 
НЕДРУГ: I bet it’s fast. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: It’s got ‘em! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now. 
ФИБИ: What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: Maybe you could be my roommate! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well there’s an idea!! 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for? 
ФИБИ: Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye. 
РОСС: Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you! 
РОСС: Okay Rach, but... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op! You’re peeping! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! Y’know what, I just got, why? Why did you do this?! 
РОСС: Look I told you... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t wanna hear "Three failed marriages!" 
РОСС: Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry! 
РОСС: What about the time I said we were on a break? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! 
МОНИКА: Pheebs, how’s it going? 
ФИБИ: I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast? 
МОНИКА: Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. 
ФИБИ: Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense. 
МОНИКА: What do you mean? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around... 
ФИБИ: That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone. 
МОНИКА: This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant. 
ФИБИ: Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shocking! Since you still have the keys. 
ДЖОУИ: You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What equity investments? 
ДЖОУИ: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow? 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don’t even have a car! 
МОНИКА: I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And? 
МОНИКА: And six others. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There you are. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, she tops out at 130. 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate. 
НЕДРУГ: Really! You got a place upstate? 
ДЖОУИ: Sure! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’ll see you later. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, take it easy. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! That’s my car. 
ДЖОУИ: Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it. 
НЕДРУГ: What-what are you doing? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up. 
НЕДРУГ: But it’s my car! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but it’s my wax. 
НЕДРУГ: Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys. 
ДЖОУИ: Sure. Here. I’ll uh, save your parking spot. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m not coming back. 
ДЖОУИ: Why not? 
НЕДРУГ: I live upstate. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, so did I. 
ФИБИ: I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy. 
МОНИКА: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe! 
ФИБИ: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass! 
ФИБИ: What?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Glass, sand, whatever. 
ФИБИ: Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep. 
МОНИКА: Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I can still do that. 
МОНИКА: How are you still single?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. 
МОНИКА: Good. What made you change your mind? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I swallowed the sonic blaster gun. 
ФИБИ: How did that happen?!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. 
МОНИКА: Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. 
НЕДРУГ: So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable. 
РОСС: Fine, I’m mentally unstable. 
НЕДРУГ: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user. 
РОСС: What?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh yes, heroin and crack. 
РОСС: Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you would know. 
НЕДРУГ: Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? 
РОСС: Oh, come on! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, please, I found the magazines! 
НЕДРУГ: And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin. 
РОСС: Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now! 
НЕДРУГ: That won’t be necessary. 
РОСС: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! 
НЕДРУГ: Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record? 
НЕДРУГ: Is there, anything in this record that is actually true? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce. 
РОСС: That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! 
РОСС: And what... ...What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?! 
НЕДРУГ: You need to get out of my chambers. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one! 
РОСС: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Would you like to spend the night in jail? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And thank you for your time. 
ДЖОУИ: So the Porsche guy took his car back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you found the keys to his clothes? 
ДЖОУИ: No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. 
МОНИКА: And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes? 
ДЖОУИ: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is true. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. 
МОНИКА: Joey, you know you don’t actually have one. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me. 
МОНИКА: All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room. 
ФИБИ: What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting! 
МОНИКА: The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while! 
ФИБИ: But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me! 
МОНИКА: He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital. 
ФИБИ: But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think that’s gum. 
ФИБИ: I’m pretty sure it’s gun. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go. 
ФИБИ: A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do? 
ДЖОУИ: Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche? 
НЕДРУГ: Maybe because you’ve got the keys? 
ДЖОУИ: Porsche. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is totally your fault! 
РОСС: My fault?! You threatened the judge! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!! 
РОСС: That was the only way I could get him to stop typing! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! How are the Gellers? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t call us that! 
РОСС: The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! It’s Porsche!! 
ФИБИ: Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now who aren’t there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ФИБИ: How do you feel? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. 
ФИБИ: Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And protected them from a tornado? 
МОНИКА: Oh my God. 
ФИБИ: I know, the babies are asleep. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, what, what happened here?! 
ФИБИ: I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! 
МОНИКА: But my apartment! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph. 
МОНИКА: But the mess! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. 
МОНИКА: You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried. 
РОСС: I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything! 
РОСС: Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! 
РОСС: Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you! 
РОСС: Yeah! Right! 
РОСС: You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right? What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing. 
РОСС: Okay, can we just sign please? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-hmm. 
РОСС: Congratulations. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Ross, we’re, wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession. 
РОСС: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. 
РОСС: Excuse me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? 
РОСС: Yeah? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess. 
РОСС: So then if-if, I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, don’t push it though. 
РОСС: I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. 
РОСС: Did I, did I even treat? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. 
РОСС: That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this. 
РОСС: Eh, no problem. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m gonna need a copy of those. 
РОСС: Totally. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! How you doin’? 
НЕДРУГ: He has the most amazing Porsche under there! 
ДЖОУИ: I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
