ФИБИ: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
ФИБИ: Okay, let's go running!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah and there's really cute guys there.

РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK!
ФИБИ: All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
ФИБИ: Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
РОСС: So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and and live forever as a machine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
МОНИКА: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
МОНИКА: Oh, So you can move them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РОСС: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
МОНИКА: It's nice to meet you. Janine?
НЕДРУГ: Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.
ДЖОУИ: I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, uh, wh-where ya from?
НЕДРУГ: Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
ДЖОУИ: From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
РОСС: So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
НЕДРУГ: I'm a dancer.
ДЖОУИ: You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey let me.
МОНИКА: Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
ДЖОУИ: Of course I did.
МОНИКА: Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
ДЖОУИ: When can you move in?
РОСС: Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Unbelievable.
МОНИКА: Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, look at all the boxes!
ДЖОУИ: Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
МОНИКА: Wait a minute. Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
РОСС: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then then I can't date her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
ДЖОУИ: Oh God, yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
ДЖОУИ: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
МОНИКА: Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
ДЖОУИ: Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
МОНИКА: Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
ДЖОУИ: You a little sad about that sweetheart?
ФИБИ: I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
РОСС: Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I used to do that too!
МОНИКА: Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw, Mon.
МОНИКА: So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
МОНИКА: Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
ФИБИ: Why? Why would you do that?
МОНИКА: I don't know. Rachel I'mI'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ankle.
МОНИКА: We'll see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
ДЖОУИ: I Gotcha!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
ДЖОУИ: Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
ДЖОУИ: I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
ДЖОУИ: Ohhhh man.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, there's just more room out here.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you try to do.
НЕДРУГ: What's wrong?
ДЖОУИ: Uh-uh nothing. IIII didn't want you to touch me cause I'm I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
ФИБИ: Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no Phoebe no, I was no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
ФИБИ: Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, wait Phoebe.
РОСС: Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
РОСС: Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
РОСС: Put it back exactly where you found it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
РОСС: ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
РОСС: Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
РОСС: Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
РОСС: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
МОНИКА: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Mon, how's it going?
МОНИКА: Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
МОНИКА: It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
МОНИКА: Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
РОСС: Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
РОСС: Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the. OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
РОСС: Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
РОСС: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the, blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd btyds. Rooosss!
ДЖОУИ: Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
РОСС: Hey, I've been married 3 times.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
РОСС: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
РОСС: Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ba dum bum chessh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
РОСС: Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not specific to girls.
ДЖОУИ: This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
РОСС: Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
РОСС: They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
РОСС: I'm never gonna find love again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
ФИБИ: Sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, um, I. All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
ФИБИ: So, what should you have done?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, II should've told you the truth.
ФИБИ: UhHuh, Which is?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little.
ФИБИ: So?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
ФИБИ: Why do you care?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because they're people.
ФИБИ: But people that you don't know and will never see again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, but still. They're people, with eyes.
ФИБИ: Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss. But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: II am not uptight. Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
ФИБИ: That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbour's dog.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
РОСС: Who cares? I repel women.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no! You can't come in here! R-r-r-rRoss is naked.
МОНИКА: What?!
РОСС: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed to see me naked.
РОСС: Why does anyone have to be naked?
МОНИКА: Why is Ross naked?
РОСС: II had to show Chandler something?
МОНИКА: Naked?
РОСС: Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
МОНИКА: Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
МОНИКА: Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye! Thank God.
РОСС: Dude, what'd you have?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
РОСС: The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's perfect! That's brilliant!
РОСС: So really, what'd ya have?
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, don't you mean for whom?
НЕДРУГ: Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
ДЖОУИ: Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before ba dum bum cheshhh.
НЕДРУГ: Is there something wrong?
ДЖОУИ: All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
НЕДРУГ: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh!
НЕДРУГ: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
ДЖОУИ: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
НЕДРУГ: I don't think so.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I do. How you doin?
НЕДРУГ: I'm OK.
ДЖОУИ: What?!?!
НЕДРУГ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Oh dear God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
ФИБИ: See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
МОНИКА: Is it okay for me to come in now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh.
МОНИКА: Why is everything different?
РОСС: Bye!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
МОНИКА: Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay look, don't don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, III cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
МОНИКА: It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you want me to be afraid of you?
МОНИКА: Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
МОНИКА: Of course!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
МОНИКА: All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
РОСС: So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer.
НЕДРУГ: and live forever as a machine!
РОСС: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I gotta go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
