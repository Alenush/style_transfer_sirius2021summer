ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well tonight’s the big night. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh... 
ДЖОУИ: That sounds perfect! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: You’re gonna mess it up let me do it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not gonna mess it up.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I’m so sorry. 
МОНИКА: What’s the big deal? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going. 
ДЖОУИ: Where are you going? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How about you guys? 
ФИБИ: Open bar? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think so. 
ФИБИ: I can do that for the kids. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you could also give back the money you owe me. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Have a benefit. 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight? 
РОСС: Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids. 
РОСС: I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp...to be a counselor! 
МОНИКА: Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that! 
МОНИКА: Do you really see this as a long-term thing? 
РОСС: I don’t know. 
ФИБИ: Y’know, you are 12 years older than her. 
РОСС: Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I’m sorry. 
РОСС: Uh-uh... Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you! 
ДЖОУИ: That’s not what she said last night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: See? Now, he could date her. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What’s going on little elves? 
ДЖОУИ: It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Thank you! 
ФИБИ: So now what’s going on here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.

НЕДРУГ: Ohh, nice choice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Good luck. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars. 
НЕДРУГ: Shut the door! Shut the door!! 
РОСС: What’s-what’s going on? 
НЕДРУГ: The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us. 
РОСС: Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building! 
НЕДРУГ: No, it’s a water balloon fight! We started it! 
РОСС: Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same. 
НЕДРУГ: Who drank all the Kamikazes? 
НЕДРУГ: Nobody! We put them in here! 
НЕДРУГ: You want some?! 
РОСС: No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sure. 
РОСС: Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh.... 
НЕДРУГ: Attack!

ФИБИ: You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you? 
НЕДРУГ: And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! 
ДЖОУИ: I won! That was my guess! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What?! What?! 
ДЖОУИ: I guessed 20,000! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! I don’t have 20,000! 
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Sit down! 
ФИБИ: Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.] 
МОНИКА: What are you doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here. 
МОНИКА: Are you okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything are you are you perrr-perfect?! 
МОНИКА: Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually... I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay? 
МОНИКА: Are you sure you’re okay? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you. 
МОНИКА: Ohh that’s sweet! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with.... 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, but just let me say it. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God, Richard. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! I’m Chandler! Oh, that’s Richard! 
МОНИКА: Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard! 
НЕДРУГ: Monica! Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey, hey! I don’t know why I did that! 
МОНИКА: Hey, it’s good to see you! 
НЕДРУГ: You too, you let uh, your hair grow long. 
МОНИКА: Yeah... Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, my nose got lonely. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good. I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I’m Lisa. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I’m sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again. 
МОНИКА: Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ll sit down. 
МОНИКА: It’s good to see you 
НЕДРУГ: You’re table’s ready sir. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Good to see you guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes. 
НЕДРУГ: Or if you prefer, this table is available. 
НЕДРУГ: That might be fun. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What were you thinking?! 
ДЖОУИ: I didn’t know it was an auction! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh?! 
ДЖОУИ: I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why would a charity give away a free boat?! 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! Charity? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh! 
ФИБИ: Well, just buy the damn boat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink? 
ФИБИ: I’m just helping the kids! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How is you drinking helping the kids? 
ФИБИ: Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. 
НЕДРУГ: Mr. Tribbiani. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center. 
ДЖОУИ: Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth? 
НЕДРУГ: I think it was valued at 19,000 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Joey, good one! 
НЕДРУГ: That’s good. Very good! 
ДЖОУИ: So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! You...can’t...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
ДЖОУИ: Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not great. 
МОНИКА: And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom. 
НЕДРУГ: And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in. 
МОНИКА: So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed." 
МОНИКА: Ohh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
РОСС: Oh my God, you guys!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! 
РОСС: Who? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Richard! 
РОСС: What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh you knew that. Good! 
МОНИКА: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. 
РОСС: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight. 
МОНИКА: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of! 
РОСС: Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do. 
МОНИКА: Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first weighing stuff. 
РОСС: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is. 
МОНИКА: If the school finds out you’re fired. 
РОСС: Hmm. 
МОНИКА: She’s leaving for three months. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For camp! 
РОСС: Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and... 
МОНИКА: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?! 
РОСС: No! No! I... didn’t do that. It’s just... Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her. 
МОНИКА: Okay well I think... that’s your answer. 
РОСС: I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year! 
ДЖОУИ: Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh great! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four. 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip? 
ФИБИ: It’s a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table? 
НЕДРУГ: That was me. 
ФИБИ: Oh, enchantée. 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table? 
НЕДРУГ: That’s me. 
ДЖОУИ: Ahh, yes. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000. 
ДЖОУИ: You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife would’ve killed me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh... 
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name? 
НЕДРУГ: It’s Pam. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam." 
ДЖОУИ: Aw-awww! 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think she’d like that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont." 
ДЖОУИ: Oooooh... 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t think so dear. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h......arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can... ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy. 
НЕДРУГ: What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right! 
ДЖОУИ: No way! It’s mine!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! What?! 
ДЖОУИ: All that stuff you just said? I want that! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Joey you don’t have $20,000! 
ДЖОУИ: Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, you’re back! 
ФИБИ: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! 
МОНИКА: Why do you want to see my hand? 
ФИБИ: I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ФИБИ: Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did you guys just do?! 
ФИБИ: What happened? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Richard was there so I couldn’t do it! 
ДЖОУИ: What?! Noooo... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it! 
ДЖОУИ: We didn’t ruin it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?! 
ФИБИ: Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor... 
ДЖОУИ: Glove salesman! 
ФИБИ: Good one! Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is terrible. What am I going to do? 
ФИБИ: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. 
ФИБИ: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! 
МОНИКА: I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes! 
ДЖОУИ: That guy’s still doing that?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!! 
ФИБИ: No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!! 
РОСС: Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake? 
НЕДРУГ: Ross! Wait! 
РОСС: Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about... 
НЕДРУГ: You suck!! 
РОСС: What?! 
РОСС: Okay, break-up’s still on! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before. 
МОНИКА: Hi guys! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: What are you up too? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Big Brother. 
МОНИКА: Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, well... Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? 
МОНИКА: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh... 
МОНИКА: Okay well that’s good to know. 
ДЖОУИ: The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in? 
МОНИКА: Sure, I love this part! 
НЕДРУГ: Come on in. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
МОНИКА: Richard! 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef. 
МОНИКА: Ohh... Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it was great seeing you the other night. 
МОНИКА: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that? 
НЕДРУГ: No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you. 
МОНИКА: What uh... What did you... What?! 
НЕДРУГ: I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did. 
МОНИКА: Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here! 
НЕДРУГ: Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you. 
МОНИКА: Oh God... Why don’t they put chairs back here?! 
НЕДРУГ: I know this is crazy but am I too late? 
МОНИКА: What the... Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?! 
НЕДРУГ: Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head! 
МОНИКА: What were you doing in Africa? 
НЕДРУГ: Working with blind kids. 
МОНИКА: Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am. 
МОНИКА: Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait! 
НЕДРУГ: You are? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
МОНИКА: Why? Because of the government. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married. 
ФИБИ: I know, they’re gonna be so happy together. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen? 
ФИБИ: Not that often! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! I’m so happy for them! 
ФИБИ: Me too! So happy for them! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m so happy and not at all jealous. 
ФИБИ: Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing. 
ФИБИ: Totally. I’m like 90/10. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah me too. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh.. no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille. 
МОНИКА: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports! 
МОНИКА: Yeah, but that’s pigs not people! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. 
МОНИКА: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?! 
МОНИКА: Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s okay, I got a plan. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We’re gonna find love! 
ФИБИ: Definitely! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though. 
ФИБИ: What do you mean? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other. 
ФИБИ: You mean a backup? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Exactly! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah I got that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You do? 
ФИБИ: Hm-mmm. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who? 
ФИБИ: Joey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you serious?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah, I locked him years ago! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey. 
ФИБИ: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, seriously? 
ФИБИ: Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Charming. 
ФИБИ: Well hey, it’s just a backup. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Monica! 
МОНИКА: Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror? 
ДЖОУИ: This is for my boat, pretty cool huh? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, it’s great. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain! 
МОНИКА: I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship! 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler giving you a hard time huh? 
МОНИКА: It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, you know Chandler. 
МОНИКА: No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed. 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe you changed? 
МОНИКА: I didn’t change! 
ДЖОУИ: Maybe that’s the problem. 
МОНИКА: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife. 
МОНИКА: Is that some kind of boat talk? 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. 
МОНИКА: What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing? 
ДЖОУИ: Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! 
МОНИКА: Well there’s some people who do want to marry me. 
ДЖОУИ: There are? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! Richard! 
ДЖОУИ: R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?! 
МОНИКА: That’s right. 
ДЖОУИ: Chandler loves marriage!! 
МОНИКА: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be! 
ДЖОУИ: You got that from what I said?! 
НЕДРУГ: When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone. 
РОСС: What happened you guys? 
РОСС: Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey you! 
РОСС: Hey, come on in. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. 
РОСС: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it? 
РОСС: I guess so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!" 
РОСС: Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Exactly. 
РОСС: Ohh, yeah I already have one. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Who? 
РОСС: Phoebe. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe?! Wait a...but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup. 
РОСС: Ohh, I don’t think so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal! 
РОСС: That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that. 
ДЖОУИ: Where the hell have you been?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was making a coconut phone with the professor. 
ДЖОУИ: Richard told Monica he wants to marry her! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My... Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: I know! They suck!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that! 
ДЖОУИ: I know! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well what... Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re right. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna go find her and I’m just going to propose! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay great. 
ДЖОУИ: Dude-dude-dude! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi. 
МОНИКА: I don’t know why I’m here. 
НЕДРУГ: I didn’t ask. You wanna come in? 
МОНИКА: I don’t know. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. 
МОНИКА: Chandler is such an idiot! 
НЕДРУГ: Drink? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, I’ll have a scotch. 
НЕДРУГ: ...on the rocks with a twist? I remember. 
МОНИКА: Still smoking cigars? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, no! No! That’s art! If it bothers you I can put my art out. 
МОНИКА: No that’s, that’s okay. 
НЕДРУГ: So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me? 
МОНИКА: Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh really? 
МОНИКА: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor. 
НЕДРУГ: Who is it? 
МОНИКА: Edward Nevski? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way? 
МОНИКА: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh. 
МОНИКА: But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups! 
ФИБИ: Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe! We’re both your backup?! 
РОСС: Phoebe, how could you do this to me?! 
ФИБИ: I don’t.... Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation! 
ДЖОУИ: No we weren’t! 
РОСС: I was not! 
ФИБИ: Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one! 
ДЖОУИ: Pick me!! 
РОСС: No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid! 
ФИБИ: All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat. This is hard! 
ДЖОУИ: This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel! 
РОСС: Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too! 
ФИБИ: No wait! Just... Okay Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God, Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: I’m talking about massages. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay that’s fair. 
РОСС: All right. 
ФИБИ: Good! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pick one. 
ФИБИ: Left! Thank you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You’re welcome. 
ФИБИ: Ross! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! We should just switch. 
ФИБИ: Yeah absolutely! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak! 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me? 
МОНИКА: Oh! Him. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Whew! 
МОНИКА: I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache. 
МОНИКА: Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that! 
НЕДРУГ: I think that’s fair. 
МОНИКА: Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! 
НЕДРУГ: It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh. 
МОНИКА: Nothing. I don’t kn...Umm. I don’t know. Umm... 
НЕДРУГ: I know. 
МОНИКА: Y’know, I-I... I have to figure..some st...Y’know, some stuff before I can... 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I’ll be here. Not smoking. 
НЕДРУГ: Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where is she? I’m not scared of you! 
НЕДРУГ: She’s not here and please come in. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, she was here, but she left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well where did she go? 
НЕДРУГ: Well she said she had to think things over. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, hey look nothing happened. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her? 
НЕДРУГ: Well all right, one thing happened? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!! 
НЕДРУГ: Well I’m sorry. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And what does she have to think about? I love her! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised! 
НЕДРУГ: Well if it helps, it worked very well. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight. 
НЕДРУГ: You were gonna propose? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring? 
НЕДРУГ: No I don’t have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know Richard...you are a good guy. 
НЕДРУГ: I know. I hate that! 
ДЖОУИ: Dude! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica! 
ДЖОУИ: She’s gone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ДЖОУИ: She’s gone. She had a bag and she left. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you talking about? 
ДЖОУИ: She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?! 
ДЖОУИ: I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well where... Where did she go? 
ДЖОУИ: To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t believe I ruined this. 
ДЖОУИ: I am so sorry man. 
МОНИКА: You wanted it to be a surprise. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God. 
МОНИКА: Chandler.... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There’s a reason why girls don’t do this! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me? 
МОНИКА: Yes. 
МОНИКА: I knew you were likely to take a wife! 
ДЖОУИ: Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here! 
МОНИКА: Come in! Come in! We’re engaged!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been! 
ФИБИ: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here! 
МОНИКА: Oh... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
