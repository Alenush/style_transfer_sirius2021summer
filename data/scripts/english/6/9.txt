МОНИКА: Okay, great! Bye. So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sidney Poitier? Hehheh.
МОНИКА: I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
МОНИКА: Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great!, I was thinking we would eat around four.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why can’t I tell them that we live together?
МОНИКА: Because they don’t know we’re dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why haven’t you told them?!
МОНИКА: Um, well, I was going to, III really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
МОНИКА: So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why wouldn’t they be happy?
МОНИКА: Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? What? Why?!
МОНИКА: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
МОНИКА: Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.
МОНИКА: You really think that’ll work?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?
МОНИКА: I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?
РОСС: Yes, of course they like you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
РОСС: Yeah, they don’t like you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you know why?
РОСС: I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Well maybe I love ya’.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys!
РОСС: No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!
НЕДРУГ: Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?
НЕДРУГ: Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
РОСС: For real?
НЕДРУГ: No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.
ДЖОУИ: Ye-ye, we go to yours!
РОСС: Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle!
ФИБИ: Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is, so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!
МОНИКА: Nothing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing?
МОНИКА: No, sweetie, II trust you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?
МОНИКА: You’re not gonna mess it up.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?
МОНИКА: Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
РОСС: And the place looks so nice!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
РОСС: Happy Thanksgiving!
НЕДРУГ: Happy Thanksgiving!
ДЖОУИ: Well, this has been great!
РОСС: See ya!
МОНИКА: Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?
РОСС: Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
МОНИКА: Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
РОСС: Some would say she’s attractive, yes.
ФИБИ: And who else is going to be there?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Her dancer friends?
ДЖОУИ: Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!
РОСС: Dude, we were good!
МОНИКА: You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!
ФИБИ: Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
РОСС: Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
НЕДРУГ: Hello everybody!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Dad, Mom. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!
НЕДРУГ: Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa, snowing out there?
НЕДРУГ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
НЕДРУГ: Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point.
МОНИКА: Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
НЕДРУГ: My joke wasn’t funny.
ФИБИ: Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad, and now he’s he’s. Jack Geller, dream hunk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.
МОНИКА: Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
НЕДРУГ: I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
ДЖОУИ: Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, what is it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
РОСС: WWhat was the one right before bananas?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought well, there’s mincemeat pie, I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
ДЖОУИ: Y-sure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
ДЖОУИ: I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
РОСС: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler!
РОСС: Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a. Sheperd’s Pie!
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
РОСС: No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.
ДЖОУИ: Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
РОСС: Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
ДЖОУИ: Vomiting stories are funny.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
ДЖОУИ: Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Still not hot enough!
ФИБИ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of condensed milk.
МОНИКА: Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at.
НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter with him?
НЕДРУГ: I think he’s stoned again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: What?
РОСС: Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
РОСС: Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do? Why?
РОСС: Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! Why did you do that?
РОСС: I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. II didn’t think it would matter.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How could it not matter?!
РОСС: How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What about all that friends forever stuff?
РОСС: I don’t know, II was all high.
МОНИКА: Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
МОНИКА: Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
РОСС: Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
МОНИКА: You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!
РОСС: Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
МОНИКА: Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the.
ФИБИ: Monica, leave him alone!
ДЖОУИ: Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.
ДЖОУИ: Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like. Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
ДЖОУИ: Oh I am!
МОНИКА: Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!
РОСС: Okay, fine!
ДЖОУИ: Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
РОСС: Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
РОСС: What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not. TruthDay!
ДЖОУИ: Look, when everyone eats that that. BananaMeat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?
РОСС: Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way no one makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potato Pie!
ДЖОУИ: Dude, they’re not objects.
ДЖОУИ: Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.
РОСС: Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s up, Ross?
РОСС: So um. Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
РОСС: And um. You look nice today.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.
РОСС: Eh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
РОСС: You’re alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, II live with Phoebe. I mean you’re alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.
РОСС: Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!
ДЖОУИ: Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling, okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
ДЖОУИ: Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!
ФИБИ: So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It sure is.
ФИБИ: Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Beef.
ФИБИ: I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. Ohhh no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
МОНИКА: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
МОНИКА: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well?
МОНИКА: Mmmm! It’s good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? How good?
МОНИКА: It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Mmm.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
НЕДРУГ: I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.
НЕДРУГ: I’ll help you dial.
МОНИКА: I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
РОСС: Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
РОСС: It tastes like feet!
ДЖОУИ: I like it.
РОСС: Are you kidding?
ДЖОУИ: What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goood.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
ФИБИ: Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
ФИБИ: I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
ФИБИ: Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
НЕДРУГ: Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.
ФИБИ: Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
МОНИКА: Ross? Let’s go.
РОСС: Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
МОНИКА: Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.
РОСС: Wha-what?
МОНИКА: Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
НЕДРУГ: What?!
РОСС: You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
НЕДРУГ: Yes.
РОСС: Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
НЕДРУГ: It was you?
МОНИКА: And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!
РОСС: Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!
МОНИКА: Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!
РОСС: Monica and Chandler are living together!
МОНИКА: Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!
ФИБИ: I love Jacques Cousteau!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!
ДЖОУИ: I wanna goooo!
НЕДРУГ: That’s alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’t supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
НЕДРУГ: And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
НЕДРУГ: What happened son?
РОСС: II uh, I got tricked into all those things!
НЕДРУГ: Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you’ve taken on Monica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say. You’re a wonderful human being.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you!
НЕДРУГ: No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don’t know what I’m gonna do about the two of you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll talk to them!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! II just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!
МОНИКА: Well actually, II didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.
ДЖОУИ: No it isn’t, I ate that.
НЕДРУГ: Well we left ours in Monica’s bedroom.
ДЖОУИ: Nope, got it and I got yours too.
