РОСС: Hey, remember when I had a monkey? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. 
РОСС: Yeah, what, what was I thinking? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe. 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see where you’re goin’! 
РОСС: What’s up with the greed Joe? 
ДЖОУИ: All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth. Why did I do that?! 
РОСС: Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here? 
ФИБИ: Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this goin’ on. Wow! I still have it! 
РОСС: Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, finally an explanation. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh? 
НЕДРУГ: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’re working? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhh do it? 
НЕДРУГ: That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He’s complained about you three times! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, where was I? 
РОСС: Hi! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey, what have you guys been up to? 
ФИБИ: Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today! 
РОСС: Wow! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya! 
ДЖОУИ: Takes it out of you? 
ФИБИ: Now, we can kick anybody’s ass! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! 
РОСС: After one class? I don’t think so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!! 
РОСС: Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call unagi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Isn’t that a kind of sushi? 
РОСС: No, it’s a concept! 
ФИБИ: Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel! 
РОСС: All right, maybe it means that too. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now! 
РОСС: Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care! 
ФИБИ: Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is. 
РОСС: Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you! 
ФИБИ: You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? 
РОСС: All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a surprise!! 
РОСС: All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour. 
РОСС: Y’know what... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey, is Monica here? 
ФИБИ: No. 
РОСС: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight. 
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas? 
ФИБИ: Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea! 
ДЖОУИ: And of course, crotchless panties. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw, I love that. 
ФИБИ: You guys! 
ДЖОУИ: You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut. 
ФИБИ: Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I made a... 
ФИБИ: What is that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nothing! 
РОСС: So what are you gonna do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for? 
ФИБИ: Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock! 
ФИБИ: Now, it’s you little bunny friend. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This, this actually is a... 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts? 
МОНИКА: Oh, yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do we have to make the entire thing? 
МОНИКА: Yes! Why, did you.. you forget to make yours? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up. 
МОНИКА: Okay. Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever! I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
МОНИКА: I’m just so excited to make the presents! Shoot! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids. 
НЕДРУГ: We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up. 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. Well but this one starts now. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study. 
ДЖОУИ: But it’s $2,000. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry. 
ДЖОУИ: Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists. 
НЕДРУГ: We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good. 
РОСС: DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!! 
ФИБИ: Ross!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What the hell was that?! 
РОСС: A lesson in the importance of unagi. 
ФИБИ: Ohh, you’re a freak!! 
РОСС: Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, so we weren’t prepared! 
РОСС: I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I... look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi. 
ДЖОУИ: 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: Chandler. I sensed it was you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
РОСС: Unagi. I’m always aware. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel? 
РОСС: What’s up? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t figure out what to make Monica. 
РОСС: Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? 
РОСС: Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. 
РОСС: Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her. 
РОСС: Why not? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. 
РОСС: Oh. 
НЕДРУГ: DANGER!!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can’t do it. I can’t do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts? 
МОНИКА: Sure! Okay, you go first. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, come here! Come here. 
МОНИКА: Okay! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it. 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs. 
МОНИКА: Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe we’ll have to listen and see! 
МОНИКА: Oh, I love it! Thank you so much! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
МОНИКА: Okay, you ready to open yours? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s a sock bunny. 
МОНИКА: Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not really. 
МОНИКА: Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies. 
МОНИКА: No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes... that’s uh... they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different. Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it’s okay. I don’t... 
МОНИКА: No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just... You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna... I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! You are way to young to have seen that! 
МОНИКА: Oops! Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are totally and completely 100% forgiven. 
МОНИКА: We have got to wash that! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! 
МОНИКА: Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have done enough! 
МОНИКА: I wanna wake up early and go get it for you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No you don’t...get it in black, not brown. 
МОНИКА: Oop, your cake is ready! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oop! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin’ a soda! 
МОНИКА: Who the hell are you?! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m Joey! How are you doin’?! 
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’...Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! 
ДЖОУИ: Look, I got to apologise on the behalf of Carl. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who the hell is Carl?! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is... 
МОНИКА: The only problem! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake? 
ДЖОУИ: Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! 
ФИБИ: Pat Sajak? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yep! 
ФИБИ: Alex Trebek? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, of course! 
ФИБИ: Chuck Woolery? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Say it! 
ФИБИ: Say we are unagi! 
РОСС: It’s not something you are! It’s something you have! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Say it! 
РОСС: Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt! 
ДЖОУИ: All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be? 
НЕДРУГ: Another Minute Maid fiasco. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s right! And what are you not gonna do? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’m not gonna talk because... 
ДЖОУИ: Damnit Carl! 
НЕДРУГ: Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s us. 
НЕДРУГ: But uh, this is a study for identical twins. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s right, $2,000. 
НЕДРУГ: But, you’re not identical twins. 
ДЖОУИ: Damnit Carl! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my good God. 
МОНИКА: Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now. 
МОНИКА: I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, the mixed tape. 
МОНИКА: The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me? 
МОНИКА: You are just the sweetest. 
НЕДРУГ: I love the way you look every night Chandler! That’s why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! You’re the sweetest! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there. 
РОСС: It’s a great class. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. 
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them... 
РОСС: No. No-no. No. What would you do next? 
НЕДРУГ: Who? Me the attacker? 
РОСС: Yes that’s right. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
РОСС: I tired attacking two women, did not work. 
НЕДРУГ: What?! 
РОСС: No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them. 
НЕДРУГ: Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?! 
РОСС: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that’s a no. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am so, so, so, so sorry! 
МОНИКА: Uh-huh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there! 
МОНИКА: Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin’ me?!

МОНИКА: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, are we going in there? 
МОНИКА: I am!! 
НЕДРУГ: You’re look for laughable... 
РОСС: Ah-ha, nowhere to run! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over... 
ФИБИ: No Rachel! They got here first! 
ФИБИ: Why is Ross doing that? 
РОСС: DANGER!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women! 
ФИБИ: We should help him! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I... Well, I don’t think they need any help.
