ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
МОНИКА: Honey, we have been through this before!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.
ФИБИ: She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
ДЖОУИ: Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
МОНИКА: You serious?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s great!
МОНИКА: Really?!
ФИБИ: Yeah well, we’ll see.
РОСС: You kissed her.
ДЖОУИ: Oh we kissed it up real nice.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
ДЖОУИ: I came over here to tell you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So she’s just waiting over there for ya?
НЕДРУГ: I gotta go.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: I’m gonna be really late for dance class!
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, now I’m really late.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
МОНИКА: Bye.
ДЖОУИ: Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever! Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
МОНИКА: I am so glad you said cooks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
МОНИКА: You got it from Pottery Barn?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A pharmacist.
МОНИКА: Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
ДЖОУИ: I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
ДЖОУИ: I was tired!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
МОНИКА: Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
МОНИКА: It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I made that for her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You made pottery?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
МОНИКА: I’m telling. If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay fine! I’llI’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: so then the farmer says, That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it.
МОНИКА: I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!
НЕДРУГ: I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
МОНИКА: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
МОНИКА: So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
НЕДРУГ: Oh that would be great!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
МОНИКА: Joey, you don’t have too!
ДЖОУИ: Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
ДЖОУИ: See ya tomorrow!
МОНИКА: Tomorrow!
НЕДРУГ: Can’t wait!
НЕДРУГ: How are we gonna get out of that one?
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: I can’t handle two nights in a row with them.
ДЖОУИ: What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
НЕДРУГ: I don’t know, they’re just a little blah!
ДЖОУИ: Blah?!
НЕДРУГ: Well y’know, he’s blah, she’s just she’s very loud for such a small person.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.
НЕДРУГ: No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y’know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
ДЖОУИ: I guess.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Guess!
ФИБИ: Umm, a flea market?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.
ФИБИ: Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, yes.
ФИБИ: Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Almost.
ФИБИ: How much was it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It was only 500 bucks.
ФИБИ: 500 bucks at a flea market?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.
ФИБИ: Oh no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.
ФИБИ: A dollar?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
ФИБИ: Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Well, what period is it from?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?
ФИБИ: Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
ФИБИ: White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! We’re here!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Oh my God!
РОСС: You like it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no!
РОСС: It’s my new apothecary table!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
РОСС: Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
РОСС: Why did you do that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because she hates Pottery Barn.
РОСС: She hates Pottery Barn?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
РОСС: What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe. Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
РОСС: Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.
РОСС: Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
РОСС: Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!
ФИБИ: Okay. Hey! Ooh, cool sheets!
РОСС: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
ФИБИ: Sure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He got it a flea market!
ФИБИ: You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hi!
МОНИКА: The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.
МОНИКА: What happened to Janine?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s too bad.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, she’s been in there all day, uh high fever, a nose problem. Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
НЕДРУГ: Monica! Chandler! I’m really-really sorry about tonight. I don’t know if Joey told you I just couldn’t get out of going to this play. I’m sorry. Have a great time.
ДЖОУИ: ‘Kay!
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.
ДЖОУИ: No-no, she really is sick!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Then why-why is she going to a play?!
ДЖОУИ: Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
МОНИКА: Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
ДЖОУИ: Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
МОНИКА: What?! What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
МОНИКА: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
ДЖОУИ: I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you sh. No you said you made that up!
ДЖОУИ: I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s drunk again.
ДЖОУИ: Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.
МОНИКА: Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: I do not like that woman!
ДЖОУИ: I can hear you!
МОНИКА: I am loud!
НЕДРУГ: Aww!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s funny.
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new, old sheet?
ФИБИ: Oh sure! Noo!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh!
РОСС: My apothecary table!
ФИБИ: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nooo!
ФИБИ: Ross, where did you get this?!
РОСС: I got it at Pottery Barn! Okay?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
ФИБИ: Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes.
ФИБИ: Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
РОСС: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
ФИБИ: Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, one more time.
МОНИКА: Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Perfect decibel.
МОНИКА: I know!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: So uh, what are you guys doing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.
ДЖОУИ: Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
МОНИКА: Well, I’d like to but, I’m not sure we have time to go.
ДЖОУИ: Ha-ha, very funny. Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
МОНИКА: We owe you?!
ДЖОУИ: That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
МОНИКА: We didn’t give you any money!
ДЖОУИ: You don’t think I know that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
РОСС: Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
РОСС: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
РОСС: Fascinating.
ФИБИ: Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
ФИБИ: Ah!
РОСС: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.
ФИБИ: Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate. And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
ФИБИ: Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
РОСС: Really?! Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.
ФИБИ: No! I do want to!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, she does want to.
РОСС: She does want to.
ФИБИ: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
ФИБИ: Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. Seriously, don’t look at it.
ФИБИ: No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.
ФИБИ: That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the. wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the. We don’t have the that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.
ФИБИ: Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just. Come on don’t be mad.
ФИБИ: No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
ФИБИ: I can’t! I can’t! Unless. Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!
ФИБИ: But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
ФИБИ: Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s right!
ФИБИ: But at least the apothecary table is real.
ДЖОУИ: Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?
НЕДРУГ: Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s totally understandable.
МОНИКА: Don’t worry about it.
НЕДРУГ: So we can go out again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah!
МОНИКА: Absolutely!
НЕДРУГ: Oh good.
ДЖОУИ: Oh well then, good night!
МОНИКА: Good night!
ДЖОУИ: See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?
НЕДРУГ: We have got to move!
МОНИКА: I knew it! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah.
МОНИКА: All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!
ДЖОУИ: All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! You two go home! III gotta talk to Janine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know I think you can take her.
МОНИКА: You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!
ДЖОУИ: All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends you can’t treat them that way.
НЕДРУГ: They said stuff to me too, y’know!
ДЖОУИ: I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They. They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, II. I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t. I’m very upset.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
МОНИКА: What did I tell you about the hall?!
НЕДРУГ: I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’d really like it if we could be friends.
МОНИКА: Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
НЕДРУГ: Great.
МОНИКА: Now come on. Well, I’m glad we worked things out.
НЕДРУГ: Me too.
МОНИКА: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: I’ll see you.
МОНИКА: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Or I’ll hear you.
МОНИКА: That’s it big girl! Come on!
НЕДРУГ: Wait!
МОНИКА: You’d better run!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did you hear that?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’m sorry man. You wanna go watch?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: How ya doin’?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
ДЖОУИ: Pretty much, yeah.
МОНИКА: I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
ДЖОУИ: Well, when it’s not right, you know it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You okay?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.
РОСС: Y’know what would cheer you up?
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
ДЖОУИ: You’re right! That did cheer me up!
