ДЖОУИ: Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s $12.75. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi! 
НЕДРУГ: How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte? 
ДЖОУИ: Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I could check with him. He says it’s okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye! 
РОСС: Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free? 
ДЖОУИ: It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls? 
ФИБИ: Yeah Joey that is so gross! 
ДЖОУИ: How about a scone on the house baby? 
ФИБИ: I’m pretty. 
РОСС: Hey does anyone have any gum? 
ФИБИ: Oh I do! Oh, y’know what? No. Wait a second. I know it’s in here somewhere. 
РОСС: Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work? 
МОНИКА: Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m so sorry you’re sick. 
МОНИКА: I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. 
МОНИКА: I have not been sick in over three years! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m gonna grab you some tissue. 
МОНИКА: I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d! 
РОСС: When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine. 
МОНИКА: I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes? 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Jill! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, Rachel! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God, introduce us! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is Chandler. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And you know Monica and Ross! 
РОСС: Hi Jill. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, how you doin’? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t!! Honey, what are you doing here?! 
ФИБИ: Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter? 
НЕДРУГ: Daddy cut me off. 
ФИБИ: Never mind, I got it. 
НЕДРУГ: And y’know what I said to him? "I’m gonna hire a lawyer and I’m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I’m gonna cut you off!" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! What did he say? 
НЕДРУГ: That he wouldn’t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he’s actually proud off. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me. 
МОНИКА: Rach? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, I bought a boat. 
МОНИКА: You bought a boat? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us? 
ФИБИ: Of course, yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that’s so great! Okay, I’m really gonna do this! I don’t know how to thank you guys. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, I like cards. 
ДЖОУИ: Are you all finished here? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. 
ДЖОУИ: Great! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: For all the free food you gave away. 
ДЖОУИ: Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it? 
НЕДРУГ: We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday. 
ДЖОУИ: Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest? 
НЕДРУГ: No! 
ДЖОУИ: Sorry! 
НЕДРУГ: I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. 
РОСС: Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don’t you want to rent me this apartment?" pants. 
РОСС: I don’t think charging new clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical! 
ФИБИ: Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea. 
НЕДРУГ: So who made her queen of the world? 
ФИБИ: I would love that job! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! What’s goin’ on? 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jill! Did you shop?! 
НЕДРУГ: No! They did! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we went shopping! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible! 
ФИБИ: Sorry Jill. 
РОСС: Sorry-sorry Jill. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’d you get? 
ФИБИ: Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y’know "I want a job sweater." 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
ФИБИ: And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Apartment pants? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, you never heard of them? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get? 
РОСС: Huh? Oh, I got this.... ...this! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A Pashmina? 
РОСС: Yeah! Oh, I-I love these babies! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? 
РОСС: Ross, wants a Pashmina? 
РОСС: It’s a rug. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jill? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry Rachel, I’m sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that! 
НЕДРУГ: Right! But, I am sorry. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the Pashmina. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. 
НЕДРУГ: She took all my stuff. 
РОСС: Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much! 
РОСС: Well. Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a Pashmina could be a rug! 
РОСС: Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I’m sorry!" 
НЕДРУГ: Shut up! I did not sound like that at all! 
ФИБИ: What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I? 
НЕДРУГ: Were you this cute in high school? 
РОСС: Oh stop. 
НЕДРУГ: No you stop! 
РОСС: No, you stop! 
НЕДРУГ: You stop! 
ФИБИ: Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it! 
МОНИКА: Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. 
МОНИКА: Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. 
МОНИКА: Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy. 
МОНИКА: Come on. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person. 
МОНИКА: I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s up?! 
ФИБИ: Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it. 
ФИБИ: No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
ФИБИ: Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: With Ross and Jill? 
ФИБИ: Yeah! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: With Ross and my sister? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh there is no way. 
ФИБИ: Okay then. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t. I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me. 
ФИБИ: But great news about the apartment pants, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: That’ll be $3.85. 
НЕДРУГ: What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff! 
ДЖОУИ: It’s just I can’t because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie. 
НЕДРУГ: Amy! 
ДЖОУИ: "...Amy! Happy birthday to you!" 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, not it here it isn’t. 
НЕДРУГ: Sorry I’m late, what’s up? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. How strong am I? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out? 
НЕДРУГ: Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys. 
НЕДРУГ: No! I mean he’s nice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? But he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date because you did. Me, not so much. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are-are you saying he’s a geek? 
НЕДРУГ: You think so too? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No I, no Ross is not a geek! 
НЕДРУГ: Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him! 
НЕДРУГ: Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant. 
НЕДРУГ: No! Y’know what Rachel? You’re right, y’know he has been really nice to me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but, he’s not your type. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you? 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She-she died Jill. 
МОНИКА: Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh! 
МОНИКА: Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep. 
МОНИКА: How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy. 
МОНИКА: Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you please get some rest! 
МОНИКА: I’m fine. 
ДЖОУИ: "Happy birthday to you!" 
НЕДРУГ: You’re paying for that. 
ДЖОУИ: What? No-no it’s her birthday! 
НЕДРУГ: You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today! 
ДЖОУИ: But it really.... 
НЕДРУГ: You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins. 
ДЖОУИ: Damnit! 
РОСС: Rach? Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
РОСС: Did you tell your sister to ask me out? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well yeah. 
РОСС: Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! 
РОСС: Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!" 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh so-so not really never. 
РОСС: I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just... y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ho, and mine! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, I think I’m sick. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe! 
МОНИКА: Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way. 
МОНИКА: Come on! I really need your help! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no-no-no-no! 
МОНИКА: Fine, I’ll rub it on myself. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself? 
МОНИКА: Yeah? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s nice. 
МОНИКА: Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes! 
МОНИКА: I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up? 
МОНИКА: Not now, I’m sick! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on you big faker! 
МОНИКА: What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that was before all the vaporizing action. 
МОНИКА: Okay, if you really wanna have sex. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! 
МОНИКА: Worked like a charm. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Wh-what are you doing here? 
НЕДРУГ: This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I-I don’t like it. 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s kinda slutty. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s yours! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut. 
НЕДРУГ: Me too. 
РОСС: Hi Jill! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РОСС: Hi . 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rachel. 
РОСС: Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not! 
РОСС: Okay. So well I’ll umm, I’ll have her home by midnight. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why aren’t you home yet?! 
МОНИКА: Is someone there? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing here? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, he brought her back to his apartment. 
МОНИКА: Who? Is that your sister? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, she is a slut! 
МОНИКА: God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s taking off her coat! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, this is just terrible. 
МОНИКА: Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I’m off to bed!
