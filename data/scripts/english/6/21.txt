РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, well thank you in advance. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat. 
МОНИКА: You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick? 
ДЖОУИ: Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?! 
ФИБИ: No! Joey, you’re going to be great! 
ДЖОУИ: But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on! 
МОНИКА: I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month. 
ФИБИ: I’ll be waiting. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that. 
ФИБИ: No, I’m just deciding which one to use. I’m gonna start writing another book! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Be-because the last one was such a big seller? 
ФИБИ: Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. 
РОСС: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
РОСС: What are you guys doing later? 
ФИБИ: Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We do? 
ФИБИ: I want to see what he wants first. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
РОСС: I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?! 
РОСС: Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good. 
НЕДРУГ: Of course we’ll help! Yeah! We’ll be here! 
РОСС: Thanks! 
МОНИКА: We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be. 
НЕДРУГ: So uh, here’s your office set! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator! 
НЕДРУГ: Let’s get you into wardrobe for a fitting. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, why don’t we do that right now? He’s right here. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Joey Tribbiani, this is... 
ДЖОУИ: Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears. 
НЕДРУГ: This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E. 
ДЖОУИ: How do you do there, Wayne? 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? 
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.? 
НЕДРУГ: C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. 
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you Mac! 
ДЖОУИ: This is like the temporary robot, right? 
НЕДРУГ: No. Why? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you. 
НЕДРУГ: I spent two years developing this machine, it’s absolutely state of the art. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry, it just...I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything. 
НЕДРУГ: It can do this. 
НЕДРУГ: This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller. 
РОСС: It-it’s great to meet you Paul. 
НЕДРУГ: I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens. 
РОСС: Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens. 
НЕДРУГ: So Ross, what your problem? 
РОСС: Eh-wh...Excuse me? 
НЕДРУГ: Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age? 
РОСС: That’s funny. Umm... It’s not funny. 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t like you going out with my daughter Ross. 
РОСС: Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute. 
НЕДРУГ: Daddy! 
НЕДРУГ: Fine! Two minutes. Go. 
РОСС: This is...you... 
НЕДРУГ: 1 minute 50 seconds. 
РОСС: Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student...I mean I not...not it! I mean, I mean I don’t. We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke....lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m Irish. 
РОСС: And the Irish guy wins the joke! 
МОНИКА: Ross!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross! 
МОНИКА: How crazy that we’d run into you! 
РОСС: Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler. 
ФИБИ: You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness. 
МОНИКА: Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s a Mr. Bing! 
НЕДРУГ: No, unfortunately Lizzie’s mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! 
НЕДРУГ: I get that a lot. 
РОСС: Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees. Yeah, why don’t you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. 
МОНИКА: Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. Not looking for dates. 
НЕДРУГ: So uh, Monica is Ross’s sister. 
МОНИКА: And he’s a great brother! 
НЕДРУГ: I had a sister. 
МОНИКА: Ohh! 
НЕДРУГ: She passed away. 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you don’t have to do that every time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You’re roommate in college died didn’t he? 
НЕДРУГ: A part of him did yes. 
РОСС: Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, we were just... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here? 
НЕДРУГ: I’m already here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Ross is sooo great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby. 
МОНИКА: No, you said the baby creeps you out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, the little girl creeps me out. 
МОНИКА: You said the baby. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would the baby creep me out? 
МОНИКА: Why would the little girl creep you out? 
ФИБИ: You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is going in your book? 
ФИБИ: Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great! 
МОНИКА: What?! Excuse me! 
ФИБИ: And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hi! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Well let’s look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them? 
НЕДРУГ: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, here they are right here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good. 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for your help. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul? 
НЕДРУГ: Just call me Paul. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy. 
НЕДРУГ: Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, we were very young when we had her. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. We? 
НЕДРУГ: Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just...I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’ 
НЕДРУГ: I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh. So you raised her all on your own? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes I did. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh. Ooh! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: How was your first day? 
ДЖОУИ: Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants! 
ДЖОУИ: Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh! 
ФИБИ: Well, why don’t you just get him fired? 
ДЖОУИ: I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani. 
НЕДРУГ: Joe! I’m glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! 
НЕДРУГ: The thing is it’s kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn’t know he might be fired. It’s the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. 
ДЖОУИ: I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!! 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-oh! 
РОСС: Joey?! 
НЕДРУГ: Hi Ross. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I was just getting him to like you. 
РОСС: Joey?! Joey!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, Joey is not here. 
РОСС: Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, it’s okay. You can come out. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah Ross it’s okay, it’s me, Mr. Stevens. 
РОСС: Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you! 
НЕДРУГ: Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye! 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll call you later. Bye Ross. 
РОСС: What-what-what the...how da-how did-what the-how did-what?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them... 
РОСС: In your mouth?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee. 
РОСС: You were at the coffeehouse! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy! 
РОСС: He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wh...You dated my sister! 
РОСС: That was different! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Why?! 
РОСС: This is weird for me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer! 
РОСС: How is that important? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it’s important! 
ДЖОУИ: Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do? 
МОНИКА: Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy. 
ДЖОУИ: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here. 
МОНИКА: No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass! 
ДЖОУИ: That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, you wish. 
ФИБИ: "You wish." 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, stop writing about us! 
ФИБИ: I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who? 
ФИБИ: Marcia and Chester. 
МОНИКА: Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hmm. 
МОНИКА: Phyllis is sitting in a chair. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. 
ФИБИ: I see what you’re doing! 
МОНИКА: Phyllis sees what I’m doing. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oh. 
ФИБИ: Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter! 
ДЖОУИ: Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! 
НЕДРУГ: Don’t touch him! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! Hey, how you doin’? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me. 
НЕДРУГ: What a nice story! 
НЕДРУГ: So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom. 
РОСС: Yeah, take your time. 
РОСС: Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as... 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you’re not all bad. 
РОСС: Not all bad. 
НЕДРУГ: And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl. 
РОСС: Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too. 
НЕДРУГ: I beg your pardon? 
РОСС: No! No! Not...I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby. 
НЕДРУГ: You have a son? 
РОСС: Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! Oh, I’m sorry! It’s unbelievable! 
НЕДРУГ: Don’t worry about it, I just didn’t realize you were married. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake. 
РОСС: You’re back. 
НЕДРУГ: You two were married?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We said seven! 
МОНИКА: We said six! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six. 
МОНИКА: Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass...seven!" 
ФИБИ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my good God. 
МОНИКА: Ugh! 
ФИБИ: I know what time you said. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
ФИБИ: Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said. 
МОНИКА: What time? 
ФИБИ: Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What does it say?! 
ФИБИ: I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything. 
ФИБИ: Thanks! So are you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I told you I should not wear this color. 
ФИБИ: Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you knew we were gonna miss the movie! 
ФИБИ: That’s right. 
МОНИКА: Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book! 
ФИБИ: Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis. 
ДЖОУИ: I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, I want to talk to you. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, how are ya? 
НЕДРУГ: Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out. 
ДЖОУИ: Why should I help you?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The reason he just said. 
ДЖОУИ: What do you need? 
НЕДРУГ: I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: I wish I could talk to her. 
ДЖОУИ: What are you in love with her or something? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ve been there my friend. 
НЕДРУГ: Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you...... You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage. 
НЕДРУГ: How to make the next one even shorter? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. Maybe I have to pee again. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives? 
РОСС: Y’know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly... 
НЕДРУГ: Are you yelling at me?! 
РОСС: God no! 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’s fine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m gonna go out with him anyway. 
НЕДРУГ: Really?! 
РОСС: Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! Still not yelling! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow. What can I say? This doesn’t make me like you any better! 
РОСС: That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either. 
НЕДРУГ: Then we agree? 
РОСС: Uh yeah, I guess... Yeah! I guess so. 
НЕДРУГ: Neither of us like Ross! 
НЕДРУГ: I like Ross. 
РОСС: Ohhh! Kids! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is! 
РОСС: That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E. 
НЕДРУГ: The shipment never made it through Omaha? 
ДЖОУИ: You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It’s your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
