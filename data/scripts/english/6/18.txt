РОСС: Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who wrote it?
РОСС: Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
РОСС: It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou, it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, is that against the rules?
РОСС: No, but it is frowned upon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see.
РОСС: Besides, there’s a big age difference.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90.
РОСС: I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.
ДЖОУИ: No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
ФИБИ: What’s a Movement class?
МОНИКА: It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.
ДЖОУИ: Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no, please-please Chandler III would owe you so much!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh okay, I’llI’ll try.
ДЖОУИ: All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah so, Tuesday?
ДЖОУИ: Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You just thought of that in there?
МОНИКА: Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
МОНИКА: You’re on the phone!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! How bad was it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
МОНИКА: Come on!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
ДЖОУИ: The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
НЕДРУГ: Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
НЕДРУГ: Professor Geller?
РОСС: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
РОСС: Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation.
РОСС: That was you?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
РОСС: Oh I, I don’tI don’t think that would be the best idea.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over you’re not my teacher anymore.
РОСС: What time?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
РОСС: Gotcha.
НЕДРУГ: I’m kidding!
РОСС: Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
ФИБИ: Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
МОНИКА: Oh well, it’s not so bad.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
ФИБИ: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My God!
ДЖОУИ: Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
МОНИКА: Joey! He’s working! You would look good in that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, how bad is it?
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How’s your room Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
МОНИКА: Isn’t that mine?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!
НЕДРУГ: So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
МОНИКА: Yes, they can stay with us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
НЕДРУГ: Well uh, do either of you smoke?
ФИБИ: No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
НЕДРУГ: No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
ФИБИ: Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, is that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great! Good for you.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey listen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm. Can you hold for one second please? What?!
ДЖОУИ: When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi! I’m back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
ДЖОУИ: Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.
ДЖОУИ: Ah-ha!
МОНИКА: Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
МОНИКА: You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, we only went out once.
МОНИКА: You dated her!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not once!
МОНИКА: All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favour?!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.
НЕДРУГ: Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My friend’s name is Joey.
НЕДРУГ: Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know III haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favour!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.
НЕДРУГ: No, no How you doing? Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The nerve huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Refill?
МОНИКА: Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
МОНИКА: I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.
ФИБИ: Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
ФИБИ: Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay!
МОНИКА: So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have.
ДЖОУИ: This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that’s where the napkin is.
ФИБИ: What’s that smell?
ДЖОУИ: I know!
НЕДРУГ: Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
РОСС: What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
НЕДРУГ: Who?
РОСС: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so II kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
РОСС: Umm, no. No.
НЕДРУГ: Yes you did! What was it?
РОСС: Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh that’s so sweet!
РОСС: Listen, I gotta tell ya, II’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller!
РОСС: Burt!
ФИБИ: So did you sleep well last night?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did.
ФИБИ: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
ФИБИ: Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: Gum!
НЕДРУГ: Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
ФИБИ: Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
НЕДРУГ: No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks like a curling iron.
ФИБИ: I don’t use a curling iron.
НЕДРУГ: Well someone does.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
НЕДРУГ: It could’ve been a hair straightener.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: This is where I keep the pizza. And. Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
МОНИКА: Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
ФИБИ: Thanks Monica!
МОНИКА: Does that smell bother you?
ФИБИ: What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
МОНИКА: Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.
ФИБИ: I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
МОНИКА: Okay!
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.
ФИБИ: Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is. Uhh. Uhh. Okay. Well, I have to go now.
РОСС: We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
МОНИКА: So it’s okay to date a student.
РОСС: Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
МОНИКА: Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.
РОСС: Yeah. What-what should I do?
ДЖОУИ: Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
МОНИКА: Joey that is so sweet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I couldn’t do it.
ДЖОУИ: You couldn’t do it?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
МОНИКА: What?! You’re going out with her again!
РОСС: Going out with who?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
РОСС: Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, that was Dana Caplin.
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhh!
МОНИКА: Joey! You didn’t even know her!
ДЖОУИ: Ah whatever!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
НЕДРУГ: Y’know uh, actually III should get going.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
НЕДРУГ: Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-no. Really?!
НЕДРУГ: Of course!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
НЕДРУГ: What?! Anything! Anything!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later.
МОНИКА: Hey! How’s it goin’?
ФИБИ: Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
МОНИКА: Yes it has! I made cookies!
ФИБИ: Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
МОНИКА: But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
ФИБИ: Okay, I’ll be out in a second.
МОНИКА: Okay!
МОНИКА: What are you doing?
ФИБИ: That doesn’t lock does it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Joey! Sorry!
ДЖОУИ: No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
ДЖОУИ: Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Look!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’ve never lived like this before.
ДЖОУИ: I know.
ДЖОУИ: All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food.
РОСС: What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
НЕДРУГ: Uhh, I can’t.
РОСС: Oh, you have some studying to do?
НЕДРУГ: No, I have some turning 21 to do.
РОСС: Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing?
РОСС: Nothing, I’mI’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!
НЕДРУГ: Do you not want to be seen with me?
РОСС: What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
НЕДРУГ: Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave.
РОСС: What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?
РОСС: That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
НЕДРУГ: You are so fired.
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’s against the rules.
РОСС: Really? Its not just frowned upon?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I love it at Joey’s!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, here you go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ni-hi-ice!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thanks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, you busy Thursday?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
ФИБИ: Hey! Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh.
ФИБИ: Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but II had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.
ФИБИ: Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah she said something about crumbies.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! No! I was so careful!
ФИБИ: Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
ДЖОУИ: That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
ФИБИ: No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. I’m sorry.
ФИБИ: All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: God, what a mess.
РОСС: Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
НЕДРУГ: For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
РОСС: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
НЕДРУГ: Wow!
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot.
РОСС: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Well III don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.
НЕДРУГ: Stop it!
РОСС: No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
НЕДРУГ: Shut the book!
РОСС: Let’s also get a hot plate!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So?!
ДЖОУИ: So?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!
ДЖОУИ: Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs. Oh!
