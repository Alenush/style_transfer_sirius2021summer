ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh.. Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago. 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister! 
МОНИКА: Joey we know you steal our food. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m good. 
МОНИКА: Oh, are the drapes still closed hon? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that a swing? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh don’t even ask! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yuck! 
ДЖОУИ: I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was like 5 years ago. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah you got 5 years left! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: You wanna make it 6?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are! 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’ll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night? 
РОСС: Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off? 
РОСС: I guess so. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumour has it you guys shut the drapes! 
РОСС: No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, slides. So really nothing happened. 
РОСС: Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right. Was it the, "Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?" 
РОСС: Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She asked-asked you out again? 
РОСС: Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it. 
РОСС: Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay. It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. I...yeah. 
РОСС: I mean after tomorrow night. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it! It’s just gonna freak me out!!! 
РОСС: Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross thanks. 
РОСС: You want me to call her right now? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy. I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you? 
РОСС: Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah do it now, call right now. 
МОНИКА: This is my favorite part. 
ФИБИ: Yeah me too. 
ФИБИ: Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well see now that I can see crying over that, but Bambi is a cartoon! 
ДЖОУИ: You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer! 
МОНИКА: Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not macho. 
МОНИКА: Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich! 
МОНИКА: Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good! 
ФИБИ: All right, what’s going on there? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin. 
МОНИКА: Where were your parents? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh they didn’t want to come! 
ФИБИ: Oh Chandler! 
МОНИКА: Poor thing! 
ФИБИ: So that story doesn’t make you cry? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?! 
ДЖОУИ: No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!! 
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me. 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: Are you Phoebe Buffay? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan. 
ФИБИ: Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented. 
ФИБИ: You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He’s a fan. Bye! 
ДЖОУИ: So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya? 
НЕДРУГ: I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies. 
ДЖОУИ: Movies? 
НЕДРУГ: That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star. 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t think so. 
НЕДРУГ: No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star! 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
НЕДРУГ: You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources. 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s not random, it’s Bob. 
НЕДРУГ: It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress. No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to. 
НЕДРУГ: You asked him too?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hm-mmm. 
НЕДРУГ: Why?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history. 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know Bob in Human Resources… 
НЕДРУГ: Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just... 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do! 
НЕДРУГ: Why are you so jealous of me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have! 
НЕДРУГ: Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob! 
НЕДРУГ: Who?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: In Human Resources!!!!!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?! 
МОНИКА: You’re jealous of Princess Caroline? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do I have my own castle? 
РОСС: Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No. 
МОНИКА: Oh great! Did you get a movie? 
ДЖОУИ: Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you? 
ДЖОУИ: Sort of... 
МОНИКА: Guys, what’s going on? 
ДЖОУИ: Phoebe’s a porn star! 
НЕДРУГ: What?!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that? 
ДЖОУИ: Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker. 
РОСС: And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I mean, I just...I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark. 
МОНИКА: This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn. 
МОНИКА: Yes, but you are dead inside. 
ДЖОУИ: All right well, I’d better take that back. 
МОНИКА: Wh-what, why? 
ДЖОУИ: We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe! 
МОНИКА: Yeah you’re right, we can’t, we shouldn’t watch this. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely not. 
МОНИКА: Y’know maybe a little bit! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Probably just the first half. 
ДЖОУИ: No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it! 
РОСС: Yeah! Good for you Joe! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool. 
НЕДРУГ: Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places? 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around. 
МОНИКА: Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Her ankle is what you’re watching? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well it’s hard to tell.. Oh God, if she would just stop moving. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She’s just doing her job! 
ДЖОУИ: You sick bastards! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t. Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula! 
ДЖОУИ: Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it! 
ФИБИ: Hey! What’s up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!! 
МОНИКА: Hey sweetie! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Chicken Soup for the Soul? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There’s no back to this couch! 
МОНИКА: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside. 
МОНИКА: Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. 
МОНИКА: Stop it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. 
МОНИКА: I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then. 
МОНИКА: And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aww, I love you so... 
МОНИКА: What is wrong with you?!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?! 
МОНИКА: What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you didn’t mean any of that?! 
МОНИКА: No you robot!! 
РОСС: You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me. Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter? 
НЕДРУГ: Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it. 
РОСС: Of course, what happened? 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t want to talk about it. 
РОСС: Okay, umm. 
НЕДРУГ: But you know what might really cheer me up? 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Seeing some more of your super-cool slides. 
РОСС: Wow! Really?! 
НЕДРУГ: Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand. 
РОСС: Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend! 
РОСС: Ohh! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere. 
МОНИКА: No, I haven’t. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her. 
НЕДРУГ: Who is it? 
ФИБИ: It’s Phoebe! Phoebe! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies. 
НЕДРУГ: No I’m not. 
НЕДРУГ: We’re still rolling! 
ФИБИ: You’re making one right now! 
НЕДРУГ: Let’s go Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: And-and you’re using my name! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, can I help you with something? 
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, come on! 
ФИБИ: Look, I’m talking right now! You’re you mean her. 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars. 
ФИБИ: No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you with that! 
РОСС: Slides are almost ready. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol! 
РОСС: Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh great! 
РОСС: Hello? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?! 
РОСС: O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! 
РОСС: So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! 
РОСС: Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me. 
НЕДРУГ: So? 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ФИБИ: So, I just came from the company Ursula works for. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, not you too! 
ФИБИ: No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them. 
ДЖОУИ: Nice! 
ФИБИ: Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address. 
ДЖОУИ: That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star? 
ФИБИ: Oh no! No! I know how to handle it. 
ДЖОУИ: You do? 
ФИБИ: Yeah. You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РОСС: You uh, you may have been right about Jill. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I knew it! What happened? 
РОСС: Umm, she kissed me. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! You kissed! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe we should give them some privacy. 
МОНИКА: Shhhh!!! 
РОСС: Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing! 
РОСС: Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! 
РОСС: Oh wait, hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that. 
РОСС: Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! 
РОСС: No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. 
РОСС: You’re welcome. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Are-are you crying? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out! 
НЕДРУГ: All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I got that. 
НЕДРУГ: And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you? 
РОСС: You take care Jill. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, see ya! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye-bye-e! 
МОНИКА: Bye. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. I can’t help it, I opened a gate.
