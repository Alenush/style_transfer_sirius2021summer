ДЖОУИ: The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it! 
ФИБИ: You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!

ФИБИ: I am extremely talented! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from.... 
ФИБИ: No, I mean I was really acting my ass off. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too. 
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me. 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed. 
ФИБИ: Fine! I’ll do it without you! I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! You’ll see!! You’ll all see!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?

ФИБИ: I am. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor. 
ДЖОУИ: You really think so? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Whoa, she's pretty. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, what? 
МОНИКА: What? 
РОСС: Excuse me? 
ДЖОУИ: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, ok. 
ДЖОУИ: There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." 
ДЖОУИ: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. 
ДЖОУИ: I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God. 
ДЖОУИ: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! 
РОСС: You're right, you're right, it is. 
МОНИКА: Yes. 
РОСС: So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? 
ДЖОУИ: All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck. 
ФИБИ: Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, whatever. 
РОСС: It’s your turn. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, are we playing this?! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! How’d the audition go? 
ДЖОУИ: Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor! 
РОСС: Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well? 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, did I fool ya? 
РОСС: Totally! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So it did go well. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, it went amazingly well! 
РОСС: Great! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh that’s great! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
РОСС: Wow! 
ДЖОУИ: And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers... 
РОСС: Oh, I love that guy! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh-oh, what are you doing? 
РОСС: What am I doing? 
ДЖОУИ: I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it is overdue. 
РОСС: Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine. 
ДЖОУИ: There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand. 
РОСС: Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! 
МОНИКА: Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce. 
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh. Is it dirty? 
МОНИКА: Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it. 
НЕДРУГ: Don't, I like it dirty. 
МОНИКА: That's your call. 
НЕДРУГ: So, uh, what are you going to do next? 
МОНИКА: Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos. 
НЕДРУГ: Are they, uh, firm? 
МОНИКА: They'r alright. 
НЕДРУГ: You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad? 
МОНИКА: No really, they're OK. 
НЕДРУГ: You gonna slice them up real nice? 
МОНИКА: Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne. 
НЕДРУГ: Aaaahhhhhhh. 
МОНИКА: I'm outa here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. 
МОНИКА: Well, what happened? 
ФИБИ: Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... 
НЕДРУГ: Ohhhhhh! 
РОСС: Oh my God! 
ФИБИ: And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. 
МОНИКА: Was it... 
ФИБИ: Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it! 
РОСС: You ate my sandwich? 
НЕДРУГ: It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. 
РОСС: Oh-oh really? 
НЕДРУГ: Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. 
РОСС: What? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away. 
РОСС: You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! 
РОСС: MY SANDWICH?!!! 
РОСС: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! 
ДЖОУИ: I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again! No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for Monica’s allergies. You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye. 
МОНИКА: Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Am I naked again?! 
МОНИКА: We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit? 
МОНИКА: Wh?! What about my allergies?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you. 
ДЖОУИ: Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: As crazy as soccer? 
ДЖОУИ: Hello? What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who’d you talk to? Nevermind! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean you didn’t get it from this? 
ДЖОУИ: The allergy guy got the part! Thanks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him! 
ДЖОУИ: How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap! 
ФИБИ: It's not that bad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. 
ФИБИ: Chandler, Chandler. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and... 
ДЖОУИ: And what?! Did you sleep with her?! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! No! I just kissed her. 
ДЖОУИ: What?!! That’s even worse!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How is that worse?! 
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know! But it’s the same! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line. 
ДЖОУИ: Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too! 
ДЖОУИ: Name one! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened?!! 
ДЖОУИ: Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! 
ДЖОУИ: Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So--You got in voluntarily?! 
ДЖОУИ: I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: BEND OVER?!!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ...And what did you bring? 
НЕДРУГ: She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Janice?! 
НЕДРУГ: Oh.... my.... God. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. 
РОСС: What? 
ДЖОУИ: No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... 
РОСС: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cupping. 
ДЖОУИ: That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? 
РОСС: Yes, yes it is. In prison! 
ДЖОУИ: I said name one! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot! 
МОНИКА: Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you’re not very good at it! I... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Do you think he’ll ever forgive me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know what? I-I kinda have. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Already? That’s pretty bad what you did. 
МОНИКА: Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works. 
РОСС: It took two people to break up this relationship!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!! 
РОСС: I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!! 
РОСС: I fell asleep! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You fell asleep?! 
РОСС: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!! 
РОСС: FINE BY ME!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I KNEW IT!!!! 
МОНИКА: You had no right to go out with him. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is the most ridiculous... 
МОНИКА: You sold me out. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did not sell you out. 
МОНИКА: Yes you did. You absolutely sold me... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Would you let me talk. 
МОНИКА: Did you just flick me? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt 
ФИБИ: Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this! 
ФИБИ: Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts! 
ФИБИ: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass. 
НЕДРУГ: Ow! Ow! Ow! 
ФИБИ: I know! I know! I know! 
ФИБИ: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Fine! 
МОНИКА: Fine! 
ФИБИ: There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando... 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please tell me you got the message! 
ДЖОУИ: What message? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock. 
ДЖОУИ: What?! It’s 6 o’clock! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches! 
ДЖОУИ: I can’t believe this Chandler! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say. 
ДЖОУИ: Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, well I’m uh... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!! 
ДЖОУИ: That’s mean! You really had me going there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, we could do this all day. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya! 
ДЖОУИ: You hug me! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, do we do this too much? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think so. Yeah, get off me. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU. 
ФИБИ: I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!! 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Well then I’ll just have to carry you. 
РОСС: That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, when you’re dead! 
ДЖОУИ: Ross, you don’t have to yell. 
РОСС: There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. 
ФИБИ: I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where’d Ross go?" 
РОСС: Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac... 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
РОСС: Oh my God. I mean... 
ДЖОУИ: Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! 
ФИБИ: He’s holding us back. 
РОСС: Totally.
