ФИБИ: Hi, you guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What’s the matter? 
ФИБИ: Well it’s just... it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum. 
ДЖОУИ: Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him. 
ФИБИ: No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll give up my ticket. 
ДЖОУИ: Me too. 
ФИБИ: Okay that’s so generous! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And I think Ross is generous too. 
ФИБИ: Great! Okay then it’s just us girls! 
НЕДРУГ: Great. 
ФИБИ: Yeah. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So what-what is the exhibit. 
ФИБИ: It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh man! 
РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend! 
РОСС: Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town. 
МОНИКА: Oh that’s great! 
РОСС: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make! 
РОСС: Why? What? 
МОНИКА: Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right? 
РОСС: No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. 
РОСС: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross. 
РОСС: Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need... he’s got like a hearing aid y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and... 
НЕДРУГ: Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her. 
РОСС: Really? That okay, that’s great. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore. 
РОСС: All right look, I-I realize it upsets you. 
НЕДРУГ: Yes it does. 
РОСС: But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired. 
РОСС: Ohh! A man with a plan! 
ФИБИ: Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek! 
ДЖОУИ: I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something. Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll.... 
ФИБИ: Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we’d be great together! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! So I’m back. 
НЕДРУГ: Who are you? 
ДЖОУИ: Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show. 
НЕДРУГ: Show me in the table. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, it’s not on TV yet. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, then it’s not on the wall yet. 
ДЖОУИ: Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? 
ФИБИ: So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet? 
МОНИКА: Oh, I love museums! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm. 
МОНИКА: Soakin’ up all the culture. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
МОНИКА: Where do you want to start? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, the gift shop! 
МОНИКА: Yeah! 
ФИБИ: Hey, and then lunch. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned. 
ФИБИ: Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?! No! Why?! 
ФИБИ: No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right? 
НЕДРУГ: You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I didn’t know you could get married here. 
МОНИКА: This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. 
НЕДРУГ: May I help you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here? 
НЕДРУГ: Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list 
МОНИКА: What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it. 
МОНИКА: Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m gonna do it too! 
ФИБИ: Me too! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Who would, who would you marry? 
ФИБИ: I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Pheebs. 
ФИБИ: Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay. 
МОНИКА: Phoebe, that stuff is... 
ФИБИ: Don’t even get me started on yours! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show? 
НЕДРУГ: I did. 
ДЖОУИ: All right, let’s get me back up there! 
НЕДРУГ: No! It don’t go up on the wall! 
ДЖОУИ: What—But you saw the show! 
НЕДРУГ: Yes, it was very offensive to my people! 
ДЖОУИ: Dry cleaners? 
НЕДРУГ: Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there! 
НЕДРУГ: That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ve never seen it! 
ДЖОУИ: Oh you should, it’s great. 
РОСС: This place is really beautiful! 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s. 
РОСС: Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes. Do-do ou want to make out? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure! 
НЕДРУГ: Are you okay? What’s wrong? 
РОСС: Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father. 
НЕДРУГ: Well, whatever works for ya.... 
РОСС: No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding. 
РОСС: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey umm, you brought protection right? 
РОСС: Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll just run to the store and get some. 
РОСС: Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you know where the store is? 
РОСС: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle? 
РОСС: A little bit. 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll be back in ten minutes. 
РОСС: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Why don’t you get in the hot tub and I’ll meet you there. 
РОСС: Ohh, okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house. 
НЕДРУГ: Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. Yeah we are. 
НЕДРУГ: Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available.... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom.... No! Not the groom!! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s so secluded up here. 
НЕДРУГ: I know. I like it up here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I... would you... actually, would you go check on that? 
НЕДРУГ: Honey, we don’t have any bears here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. I’ll be right back. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. What?! What are you doing here?! 
РОСС: What are you doing here?!

РОСС: Yeah, I recognize the ankles! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Get up!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh. Thank you! 
НЕДРУГ: Diet Coke. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Op, ice. I need ice.

РОСС: Did you really hear a bear? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Go-go! 
НЕДРУГ: Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, thank you. 
НЕДРУГ: I’m so happy that you’re here.

НЕДРУГ: Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth’s here! Who are you talking to? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, you guys? 
НЕДРУГ: How did you know we were here? 
НЕДРУГ: Umm... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage. 
НЕДРУГ: Obviously. 
НЕДРУГ: Elizabeth, what are you doing here?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Yep. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, why do y’know go in that room and do your homework? 
НЕДРУГ: Ohh, I wouldn’t do it in there. That’s my dad’s bedroom. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. That’s your dad’s bedroom!

НЕДРУГ: Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller. 
МОНИКА: Oh no!

МОНИКА: NOOOO!!!!!!!! 
НЕДРУГ: Can I help you? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall? 
НЕДРУГ: He’s not here right now. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall. 
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You’re the other one right? 
НЕДРУГ: So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible! 
НЕДРУГ: Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome. How much more homework do you have? 
НЕДРУГ: Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car. 
НЕДРУГ: What do you need from the car? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Surprise me. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be! 
НЕДРУГ: Just relax. Just relax Paul, you’re doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y’know why? Because you’re a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You’re just a love machine. I’m just a love machine and I won’t work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I’m just a love machine, yeah ba-by! 
МОНИКА: Phoebe! 
ФИБИ: Yeah? 
МОНИКА: Have you seen Chandler?! 
ФИБИ: No! Why? 
МОНИКА: The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?! 
ФИБИ: Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God! 
МОНИКА: I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere! 
ФИБИ: What are you gonna do? 
МОНИКА: Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure! "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?" 
ФИБИ: Rachel said that! 
МОНИКА: Well Rachel’s not here! 
ФИБИ: Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" 
ДЖОУИ: I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?! 
НЕДРУГ: Son of a bitch! 
ФИБИ: Okay, maybe ask this guy. 
НЕДРУГ: You, get out of my shop! 
ФИБИ: Well, what did he do? 
НЕДРУГ: He went out with my wife! 
ФИБИ: Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I... Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her! 
НЕДРУГ: That’s my wife!!! Get out! 
ФИБИ: Well, we should go. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross? Ross? 
РОСС: Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I’m gonna go out this window. I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay? 
НЕДРУГ: Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda! 
НЕДРУГ: Ross! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here? 
РОСС: And that is why we cannot see each other anymore. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk. 
НЕДРУГ: Daddy! 
НЕДРУГ: You’re next!! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay. I didn’t know he was here. 
НЕДРУГ: Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!" 
РОСС: Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain. 
НЕДРУГ: No, let me explain! Fired!! 
РОСС: All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. 
НЕДРУГ: What? 
РОСС: And I too am just a love machine. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, let me show you where the guest room is. 
МОНИКА: I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. 
МОНИКА: Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right here! 
МОНИКА: Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way! 
МОНИКА: It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Really? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready. 
МОНИКА: I know! I know. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. 
МОНИКА: I’m gonna go tell Joey that that you’re back. I was really worried about you. 
ФИБИ: Hey, did she buy it? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Totally. 
ФИБИ: So did Heldi show you the place? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it’s beautiful. 
ФИБИ: I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Gunther. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go. 
НЕДРУГ: Do you still work here? 
ДЖОУИ: No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to tell you that one? I’m sorry. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway. 
ДЖОУИ: Great!
