РОСС: Hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment? 
РОСС: Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? 
РОСС: Oh yeah, why not? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. 
РОСС: Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird? 
ФИБИ: Always. 
РОСС: I didn’t get the annulment. 
ФИБИ: What?! 
РОСС: We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. 
РОСС: Hey, do you have any gum? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh? Yeah! Sure! 
ФИБИ: Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie. 
ФИБИ: Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica. 
ФИБИ: Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn’t get the annulment?!! 
РОСС: I know. 
ФИБИ: Ross?! 
РОСС: Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces. 
ФИБИ: Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive. 
РОСС: Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage! 
ФИБИ: So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!...Op, woman! Sorry. 
РОСС: Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please? 
ФИБИ: Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?! 
ФИБИ: Hey Rach! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What was that?! 
ФИБИ: Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I haven’t seen it yet! 
ФИБИ: Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noooooooo!! 
НЕДРУГ: In case you’re wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names.} 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine? 
МОНИКА: Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict. 
МОНИКА: Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I’m sick. 
МОНИКА: Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time? 
МОНИКА: Pretty much. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey Monica! 
МОНИКА: Hi! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey man, you feeling any better? 
МОНИКА: Joey, we have something to tell you. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! You’re pregnant! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Well, uh...Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later. 
МОНИКА: Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you’d believe that. This sucks! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you! 
ДЖОУИ: Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm...Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! 
МОНИКА: Hey Pheebs! 
ФИБИ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey, have you seen Rachel? 
ФИБИ: No, why? 
МОНИКА: I have some pretty exciting news! 
ФИБИ: You’re pregnant! 
МОНИКА: No! Chandler and I are moving in together! 
ФИБИ: Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe. 
РОСС: Hey! Hi! 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
РОСС: What’s up? 
МОНИКА: Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together. 
РОСС: Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great. 
ФИБИ: Guys, I’m happy too. 
МОНИКА: Okay, come here! 
ФИБИ: Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled... 
МОНИКА: Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? 
РОСС: Bye. 
ФИБИ: Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel.... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?! 
РОСС: Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs! 
ФИБИ: Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates. 
РОСС: No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists. 
ФИБИ: Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces! 
РОСС: Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times? 
ФИБИ: Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here. 
РОСС: What?! Why? 
ФИБИ: Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him? 
РОСС: And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Ugh, I thought you were Rachel! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What gave me away? 
МОНИКА: I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya? 
МОНИКА: No. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty... 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All yours babe. 
МОНИКА: Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys! 
МОНИКА: Really?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together! 
МОНИКА: Yes, we are. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rach... 
МОНИКА: Yeah, he’s gonna work on that. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God! Come and knock on my door.... 
МОНИКА: We’ll be waiting for you... 
НЕДРУГ: I’ll finish that one for those of you who don’t know what they’re talking about. Where the towels are Hers and Hers and His, Three’s Company too! Yeah, that’s the theme song for Three’s Company.} 
РОСС: ....once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault. 
ФИБИ: Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him? 
НЕДРУГ: Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married. 
ФИБИ: Okay, what about you? Wouldn’t you want a date? 
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out.... 
ФИБИ: Whatever! What about you Meg? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. 
РОСС: What?! 
ФИБИ: She said, "He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." 
РОСС: This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here? 
ФИБИ: Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her. 
РОСС: We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol! 
ФИБИ: Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! 
РОСС: Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times. 
ФИБИ: Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg. 
РОСС: Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth......Nothing!! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy. 
НЕДРУГ: I am so attracted to him right now. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen? 
МОНИКА: Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, Joey’s my best friend. 
МОНИКА: I’m not your best friend? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You just said. Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though? 
МОНИКА: All right, all right, at least I’m prepared. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Oh yes. 
МОНИКА: Hey! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey-hey! 
МОНИКА: These aren’t for you! Are you upset? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am now! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey roomie! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, bye! 
МОНИКА: Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you pregnant?! 
МОНИКА: No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Um-hmm. 
МОНИКА: Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that. 
МОНИКА: Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Okay. Don’t you want a cookie? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure? Thanks. 
МОНИКА: Maybe, do you need a tissue? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica, where did you get these?! 
МОНИКА: I made them! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! 
ДЖОУИ: God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there." 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not once did we do that. 
МОНИКА: Hi. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hi. 
МОНИКА: So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it? 
МОНИКА: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry? 
МОНИКА: I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?! 
НЕДРУГ: You got married again. 
РОСС: Yes. 
НЕДРУГ: So that’s your second marriage in two years. 
РОСС: Yes, second in two years. Third overall. 
НЕДРУГ: Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened. 
РОСС: Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk! 
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage? 
РОСС: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her. 
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that’s better then. 
РОСС: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled. 
НЕДРУГ: I see. Have you considered therapy? 
РОСС: I think just the annulment for today. 
НЕДРУГ: There are a couple of forms to fill out. 
РОСС: Easy. 
НЕДРУГ: And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. 
РОСС: No problem. 
НЕДРУГ: And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. 
РОСС: Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. 
НЕДРУГ: Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there. 
РОСС: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! 
МОНИКА: Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! 
МОНИКА: Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What the hell is that? 
МОНИКА: I don’t know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate! 
МОНИКА: Something to remember me by! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time. 
МОНИКА: But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you okay? You’re not blinking. 
МОНИКА: I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era. 
МОНИКА: An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is the matter with you?! 
МОНИКА: What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe. 
МОНИКА: What’s hard to believe? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry. 
МОНИКА: Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I... 
МОНИКА: No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It is? Really? 
МОНИКА: Yeah, sweetie. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore? 
МОНИКА: No. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! 
МОНИКА: I’m gonna miss you! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean it’s the end of an era! 
МОНИКА: I know! 
ФИБИ: Okay, bye! 
РОСС: Oh no. 
ФИБИ: So? Did you get the annulment? 
РОСС: I couldn’t. 
ФИБИ: I knew it! Because you love Rachel. 
РОСС: It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I.... 
ФИБИ: Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love. 
РОСС: I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her? 
ФИБИ: I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her. 
РОСС: I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! 
РОСС: Ohh, what’s wrong?! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing. 
РОСС: Oh my...Come here! Come here! It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you. 
РОСС: Of course. 
ДЖОУИ: So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up? 
ФИБИ: Oh we do, but not just yet. 
ДЖОУИ: Really?! Well, when? 
ФИБИ: Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out. 
ДЖОУИ: Wow. 
ФИБИ: I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids. 
ДЖОУИ: Great! 
ФИБИ: But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh, what about Ross? 
ФИБИ: I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
