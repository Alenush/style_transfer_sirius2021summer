ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
ДЖОУИ: Right! And when is that due?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: First of the month.
ДЖОУИ: And that’s every month?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, just the months you actually want to live here.
ДЖОУИ: Ahhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, here is the phone bill.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just, why don’t I just cover you for a while?
ДЖОУИ: No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity anymore.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s not charity, Joe.
ДЖОУИ: No! Forget it! Okay, I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay uh, here’s the electric bill.
ДЖОУИ: This is how much we pay for electric?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?
ФИБИ: So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.
ФИБИ: Well, how much do you think he needs?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I figure that 1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
ФИБИ: Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that would help the pride thing.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
МОНИКА: Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
ФИБИ: And also, my birthday.
МОНИКА: It’s not your birthday.
ФИБИ: What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.
РОСС: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
РОСС: I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, I was wondering.
МОНИКА: You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
МОНИКА: Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
ФИБИ: My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah, I know.
ФИБИ: Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.
МОНИКА: Rachel, I need to borrow. You’re not packed! You’re not packed even a little bit!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Surprise!
МОНИКА: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no don’t get mad because look, this is what happened. So II started packing, then I realized, What am I doing? I am lousy at packing! Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
МОНИКА: I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?
ФИБИ: I have plans.
МОНИКА: You’re plans were with us.
ФИБИ: That’s right.
МОНИКА: All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Okay! Oh my God, thank you!
ФИБИ: Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!
МОНИКА: Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh nope, II have plans with Joey.
МОНИКА: I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but for the last time.
МОНИКА: Okay fine, now Ross.
РОСС: Oh, but-but I can’t do it.
МОНИКА: Why not?
ДЖОУИ: I’ve got Ben.
РОСС: Because, because I’ve got Ben.
МОНИКА: It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He’s at a dinner party.
МОНИКА: Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
РОСС: Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
МОНИКА: All right, sorry.
РОСС: I gotta go make a fake Ben.
ДЖОУИ: Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
ДЖОУИ: Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
ДЖОУИ: What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes it would. What do you say to 50?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, you’re on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohhh, look it’s the roller blades.
МОНИКА: Oh God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You remember when we got these?
МОНИКА: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I guess you weren’t there.
ФИБИ: You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time. You don’t remember?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.
МОНИКА: I’m gonna miss you so much.
ФИБИ: Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.
МОНИКА: I don’t think there’s anything.
ФИБИ: Come on, there’s gotta be something.
МОНИКА: Nope, she’s perfect.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have one.
ФИБИ: Good! Great! You can go first.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.
ФИБИ: Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
МОНИКА: Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
ФИБИ: Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?
МОНИКА: Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You get your messages!
МОНИКА: Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
ФИБИ: Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
ДЖОУИ: Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! 500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, 1,000.
ДЖОУИ: You serious?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yes!
ДЖОУИ: Okay, get ready to owe me!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, here we go. Ready?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! No! No! No, one can beat me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
МОНИКА: Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, your brother. Score!
МОНИКА: What’s up?
РОСС: Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
МОНИКА: Oh, put him on!
РОСС: Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what else I’m not gonna miss? I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!
МОНИКА: Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!
ФИБИ: Hey! I call her!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!
ФИБИ: Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Still broken?
ДЖОУИ: This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and 500.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
ДЖОУИ: Nah, not my game.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, uh, how about, how about y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.
ДЖОУИ: Well, what’s it called?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Cups.
ДЖОУИ: I don’t know how to play Cups.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.
ДЖОУИ: All right.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
ДЖОУИ: A two and a five.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
ДЖОУИ: Really?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. What do you got?
ДЖОУИ: A four and a nine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re kidding right?
ДЖОУИ: No. Why?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well that’s a full cup!
ДЖОУИ: Damn! I am good at Cups!
МОНИКА: I’m not talking to her!
ФИБИ: Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
МОНИКА: Well, maybe you’re right. She made fun of my phone pen!
ФИБИ: I know, I took it hard too.
МОНИКА: Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about. What are you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m unpacking!
МОНИКА: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not moving! Is that picture straight?
МОНИКА: It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
МОНИКА: Because it’s my apartment!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
МОНИКА: How about, you’re moving!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!
ФИБИ: Hey, how are you guys doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great! Monica’s moving!
МОНИКА: I am not!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
ФИБИ: Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys. STOP! I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.
МОНИКА: No Phoebe I am mad!
ФИБИ: Well, deep-deep-deep down!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I’m just mad!
ФИБИ: Then keep running.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You win.
ДЖОУИ: Well, what did you have?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is DCup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, wow, 700.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not 700 exactly?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Double it!
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well you see in Cups, once you get 700, you have to double it.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth 100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get. No way!
МОНИКА: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, What were you thinking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
ФИБИ: Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
МОНИКА: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know III said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh really? Like what Monica?
МОНИКА: Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, good start Mon.
МОНИКА: She lets you borrow them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
МОНИКА: Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
ФИБИ: What else?
МОНИКА: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I do. II do, do that.
ФИБИ: That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
МОНИКА: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
МОНИКА: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s gonna be fine.
ФИБИ: Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
ФИБИ: Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
МОНИКА: Kinda. Oh my God!
РОСС: Hello? Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right. Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s wrong?
ДЖОУИ: Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost 1,500 to him in Cups!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: WhHow did you lose at Cups?!
ДЖОУИ: The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the DCup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh man!
ДЖОУИ: And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a. I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
ДЖОУИ: It’s him, not it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, but wait what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say 1,500?
ДЖОУИ: Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When did I try to give you money?
ДЖОУИ: Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said No, you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
ДЖОУИ: I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss, is you. And now the dog.
МОНИКА: Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: I’m really gonna miss you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
МОНИКА: Thanks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours!
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye house!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bye Mon.
МОНИКА: Bye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: She really left.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No problem roomie.
МОНИКА: Can I ask you a question?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure!
МОНИКА: What the hell is that dog doing here?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
РОСС: And now you want that money back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Exactly.
РОСС: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s not a real game! I made it up!
РОСС: I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: At a fake game!
РОСС: Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
РОСС: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time.
