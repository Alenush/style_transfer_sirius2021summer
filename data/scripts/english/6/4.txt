РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
МОНИКА: This bottle opener.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And?
МОНИКА: And it’s a magnet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look at that!
РОСС: How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: You complete me kitchen, matey!
ФИБИ: Ross, I know what you’re thinking.
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.
РОСС: Oh, my, God! II see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
ФИБИ: What?!
РОСС: Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel? Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel? When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel? You want her!
ФИБИ: No!
РОСС: Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks mine?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No-no, I bought those.
МОНИКА: Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: That you’re a liar.
РОСС: No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
МОНИКА: Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
РОСС: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, who wouldn’t?!
РОСС: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.
ФИБИ: Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And Mrs?!
ФИБИ: Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
ФИБИ: Just kidding!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Oh God!
ФИБИ: Saved your ass.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hi.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, what’s the matter?
ФИБИ: Well, you know that psychic I see?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
ФИБИ: Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?!
ФИБИ: Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
МОНИКА: Phoebe that’s crazy!
ДЖОУИ: I can’t believe she would say that too you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
ФИБИ: I don’t, she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
ФИБИ: No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!, leans back, and starts reading.
РОСС: Hey everyone!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh hi!
РОСС: Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
НЕДРУГ: Oh that’d be great. Sure!
РОСС: There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct.
ФИБИ: Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.
РОСС: subcategories. The first of these subcategories is.
ДЖОУИ: Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
РОСС: No! Why?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.
РОСС: Ohh! Okay! Okay. There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why don’t you open with a joke?
РОСС: Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!
РОСС: Okay!
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
РОСС: Thank you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Some uh, some visual aides.
ДЖОУИ: Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?
РОСС: Please don’t say naked chicks.
ДЖОУИ: Why not?!
РОСС: III don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Any good mail?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Benefits lapsed.
ДЖОУИ: Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a movie called benefits lapsed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.
ДЖОУИ: Let me see that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to stop catching on fire.
ДЖОУИ: All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
ДЖОУИ: look both ways before you cross the street.
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?
ФИБИ: Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
ФИБИ: I was preparing you for my, didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
ФИБИ: Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica!
МОНИКА: Hmm?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did-did you take these back?
МОНИКА: No-no, II just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?
МОНИКА: I loved them!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Nice try!
РОСС: Hello!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
МОНИКА: How’d the lecture go?
РОСС: It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.
РОСС: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, Ross you have to be funny and sexy. Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
МОНИКА: That you’re not funny or sexy?
РОСС: That’s right!
ДЖОУИ: Hey Estelle, listen.
НЕДРУГ: Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
ДЖОУИ: What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!
НЕДРУГ: Really?!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Oh well, no harm, no foul.
ДЖОУИ: Estelle, you gotta get me some work. II lost my health insurance.
НЕДРУГ: All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
ДЖОУИ: Why?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
ДЖОУИ: Bastard!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?
ДЖОУИ: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What’s wrong with you?
ДЖОУИ: Nothing! Well, II got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This sounds like a hernia. You have to, you-you go to the doctor!
ДЖОУИ: No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s a hernia.
ДЖОУИ: Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.
МОНИКА: Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
РОСС: Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when Oh bloody hell.
МОНИКА: What the hell are you doing?!
РОСС: Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and not a very good one.
РОСС: Will you-will you please?
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the paleontology department here.
РОСС: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
РОСС: I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.
МОНИКА: Monica Gellerrr.
РОСС: Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
МОНИКА: Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!
РОСС: Just please stop!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice this time of year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
ДЖОУИ: Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing pushed back in.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
ФИБИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: What’s going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!
ДЖОУИ: Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn’t hurt that bad.
ФИБИ: Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
ДЖОУИ: Sure, now I’m scared.
ФИБИ: No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!
ФИБИ: No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
МОНИКА: Gimme ‘em!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! They are mine!
МОНИКА: You stole them from me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You stole them from me!
МОНИКА: Gimme them!
МОНИКА: You just wanna each take one?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
РОСС: Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well?
МОНИКА: Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!
РОСС: They’re not listening too me?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
РОСС: Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
МОНИКА: I think you look fine.
НЕДРУГ: Whenever you’re ready.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you.
НЕДРУГ: Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less intense?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just hold on one second. Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
НЕДРУГ: That’s where you pick up the bag.
ДЖОУИ: Exactly.
НЕДРУГ: No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
ДЖОУИ: Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn’t get it, did I?
НЕДРУГ: No.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, okay.
ДЖОУИ: Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani I’m here to audition for man.
НЕДРУГ: You mean dying man?
ДЖОУИ: Yes!
МОНИКА: Okay, come on, do it one more time!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Really?!
МОНИКА: Yes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay! Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you to come on board with us full time!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?! How do you know?
ФИБИ: Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I’m sorry.
ФИБИ: Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But are you sure you can do this?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now, is that never talking about it again?!
ДЖОУИ: Hiya!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey, we’re ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he’s going to be playing your son.
ДЖОУИ: Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, Take good care of your Momma son, that’s your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let’s do this.
НЕДРУГ: Scene 5, take 1.
НЕДРУГ: And Action!
ДЖОУИ: Take good care of your Momma son. Take good care of your Momma son. Come on son! Your Momma’s good people!
НЕДРУГ: Cut! Alex, remember you’re supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
НЕДРУГ: Okay.

НЕДРУГ: Take 36 is up!
НЕДРУГ: All right! Let’s try this again! You ready Joe?
ДЖОУИ: Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
НЕДРУГ: Uh sure.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Action!
ДЖОУИ: Take good care of your Momma son.
НЕДРУГ: Cut!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello?
НЕДРУГ: Hello, is Ross there?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross got married again? Noooo!
РОСС: All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis. Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
НЕДРУГ: What’s happening to your accent?
РОСС: Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? All right, I’mI’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’mI’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife! What, were you just never gonna tell me?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Ugh, I could just kill you!
РОСС: Well, hello Rachel!
ФИБИ: Have you really done this before?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.
ФИБИ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey-hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing?
ФИБИ: We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, all right.
