НЕДРУГ: This is an hour-long special episode. Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616. Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Wow!
ДЖОУИ: What is the matter with you?!
ФИБИ: No! Barry and Mindy.
ДЖОУИ: Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
ДЖОУИ: Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
МОНИКА: Why did they get divorced?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
РОСС: I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
ФИБИ: Which time?
РОСС: The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
ДЖОУИ: I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.
РОСС: I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
МОНИКА: And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure I would!
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?
РОСС: No, I just think Monica was that fat.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, II don’t have to wear a tie.
ФИБИ: What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
РОСС: What?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Merrill Lynch?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well why didn’t you take the job?
ФИБИ: Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
РОСС: Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?
НЕДРУГ: This is where the opening credits are, but they’re not the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel’s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they’re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn’t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.
РОСС: Oh my God! Rachel Green?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rob Tillman!
РОСС: No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
РОСС: No, no-no, Ross Geller.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!
РОСС: Yeah. Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! How are you?!
РОСС: Good-good, I’mI’m married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Me too!
РОСС: Is-isn’t it the best?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s the best! So, umm how’s Monica?
РОСС: Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I would love too.
РОСС: Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! Okay!
РОСС: Come on!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
РОСС: No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah? Okay.
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
РОСС: Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let’s go see Monica!
ДЖОУИ: So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
МОНИКА: He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.
НЕДРУГ: Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
МОНИКА: Thanks.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Y’know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it’s a seed.
ДЖОУИ: Wow!
НЕДРУГ: Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut?
ДЖОУИ: Oh dear God, let me think.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Oh no! What’s the matter?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not Archie Comic funny.
НЕДРУГ: Y’know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
МОНИКА: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Was his question what’s more boring than him?
ДЖОУИ: Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ehh.
МОНИКА: Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
ДЖОУИ: That’s an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
МОНИКА: No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
ДЖОУИ: That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I could use the money it could give me time to write.
ДЖОУИ: Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
ДЖОУИ: All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
ФИБИ: What?
МОНИКА: Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
ФИБИ: Ohh that’s so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnn! Go! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
РОСС: Hey Mon!
МОНИКА: Hey!
РОСС: Mon, look who I ran into!
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Rachel! You look terrific!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
МОНИКА: You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
РОСС: And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah.
РОСС: And that’s Phoebe over there!
ФИБИ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?
РОСС: 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. Right. So now, are do you, do you still do music?
РОСС: Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I’ll play you one of my other.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
МОНИКА: Rach, he’s a friend of ours.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
РОСС: Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He’s coming over! He’s coming over!
МОНИКА: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: I know, here-here!
МОНИКА: Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tried to kill you.
ДЖОУИ: Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah!
ДЖОУИ: She’s not crazy is she?
МОНИКА: No.
ДЖОУИ: So uh, how you doin’?
ФИБИ: Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go! Who’s this? Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I. Whatever. Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
ДЖОУИ: Hey there you are!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-oh, it’s my boss!
ДЖОУИ: All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
МОНИКА: You realize what you are don’t you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: You’re his bitch.
ФИБИ: No-no! No!
МОНИКА: Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my KitKats did you?!
ФИБИ: No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But the KitKats are all right?!
ФИБИ: What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
МОНИКА: What?!
ФИБИ: My chest hurts! Oh, and now II can’t breathe.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
ФИБИ: Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
МОНИКА: Yes!
ФИБИ: Then yes that is what I’m having.
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
РОСС: Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.
ФИБИ: Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
МОНИКА: Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
МОНИКА: Let’s take a walk. Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
ФИБИ: So what’s going on with you?
РОСС: Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
ФИБИ: Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
РОСС: Yeah.

РОСС: Well, last weekend.
ФИБИ: Oh that’s not so bad.
РОСС: will be two months.
ФИБИ: That is.
РОСС: since I stopped trying.
ФИБИ: Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
РОСС: What-what do you mean?
ФИБИ: I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up you could eat stuff off each other.
РОСС: Oh.
ФИБИ: Y’know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys.
РОСС: Wow!

ДЖОУИ: Thanks! Yeah, there’s pulp in that.

ДЖОУИ: I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.

МОНИКА: Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy, uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist, as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.
ДЖОУИ: Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
МОНИКА: Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! And I’m one of them! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
МОНИКА: Well, you’re not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
МОНИКА: Yeah I can! And don’t think I don’t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right?
МОНИКА: Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!
МОНИКА: Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I heard it.
МОНИКА: It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Do it! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!
МОНИКА: Y’know what? You are right?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever.
МОНИКА: Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh what do you know? Virgin!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
МОНИКА: Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
ФИБИ: No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
МОНИКА: Put it out!
ФИБИ: Okay! Okay! I’m so glad you’re here.
РОСС: Come on. I got it.
ФИБИ: Oh, give it to me.
РОСС: I got it!
ФИБИ: Give it!
РОСС: Hello? No she can’t come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
ФИБИ: Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
РОСС: J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
ФИБИ: Thank God.
РОСС: Yeah, she’s fired.
НЕДРУГ: You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
НЕДРУГ: Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
НЕДРУГ: Not so fast Wesley!
НЕДРУГ: Remoray!
НЕДРУГ: That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Thank God!

НЕДРУГ: This is where Part II begins, which means this is now episode 616.
РОСС: So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
РОСС: Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone’s been doing their homework.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so.
РОСС: Oh, I know. Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, me too.
РОСС: Yeah? Well, II think Ben’s asleep.
НЕДРУГ: Oh umm, y’know I think it would be better if we just save it.
РОСС: Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
РОСС: Hey, Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey, how’s it going?
ФИБИ: Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
МОНИКА: Here you go sweetie.
ФИБИ: What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
МОНИКА: But, I put some honey in it.
РОСС: She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, the doctors say it may kill her.
ФИБИ: What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But I think we should tell her.
РОСС: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
ФИБИ: Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
ФИБИ: I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?
МОНИКА: Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
ФИБИ: Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
ФИБИ: Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!
ДЖОУИ: I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!
ДЖОУИ: Do you uh, do you ready for a refill?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I probably shouldn’t so I will! Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!
ДЖОУИ: Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Umm, can I use your bathroom?
ДЖОУИ: It’s uh, right through there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it sure is!
МОНИКА: I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?
НЕДРУГ: They have parasites?
МОНИКА: No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
НЕДРУГ: What people?
МОНИКА: People! People say it! Come here!
НЕДРУГ: So oysters, huh?
МОНИКА: And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
НЕДРУГ: Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases.
МОНИКА: No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!
НЕДРУГ: Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay!
МОНИКА: Okay! Ohhh no!
НЕДРУГ: I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
МОНИКА: I can’t promise anything.
РОСС: We’re really gonna do this, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Looks like it.

НЕДРУГ: Thank you so much.
РОСС: How hot is this?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.
МОНИКА: Yeah, me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979.
МОНИКА: Stop it! That’s not funny!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: I’m sorry, okay? It just tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What was tonight?

МОНИКА: How many?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nine.
МОНИКА: I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
МОНИКА: No. He’s not a horrible guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.
МОНИКА: Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
МОНИКА: Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: I was kidding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So was I.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
ДЖОУИ: Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Tell me something Joey. Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah you did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.
ДЖОУИ: Come, come here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We can’t do this.
МОНИКА: No! Oyster?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.
МОНИКА: Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do like that.
МОНИКА: It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
МОНИКА: Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!
МОНИКА: Noo! Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
МОНИКА: Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have some moves.
МОНИКА: I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, let’s just forget it.
МОНИКА: What if I turn out the lights?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah.
МОНИКА: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah?
МОНИКА: That’s the couch.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
МОНИКА: I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay!
ДЖОУИ: Morning!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh right.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
ДЖОУИ: Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Noo! Oh God we did we didn’t, we didn’t uhh.
ДЖОУИ: No! No! No, not after seeing that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: God I’m just a horrible person.
ДЖОУИ: Wh-why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
ДЖОУИ: That’s ridiculous! I’m not a Star, just a regular famous actor.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.
ДЖОУИ: Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The ring from the cave, yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Wow! Uh okay, well uh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
ДЖОУИ: Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! No-no-no.
ДЖОУИ: Yes! Yes! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
ДЖОУИ: Look, do you want the ring or not?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: Look at you! You’re up!
ДЖОУИ: All right!
ФИБИ: I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.
ДЖОУИ: Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
ФИБИ: No. I’ve learned my lesson.
ФИБИ: Let’s go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
РОСС: Hey Joe did. Did you ever have a threesome?
ДЖОУИ: Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I.
РОСС: No! The reason I’m asking is that. I sorta had one last night.
ДЖОУИ: You?
РОСС: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: Wow!
РОСС: Yeah!
ДЖОУИ: All right! So, was it amazing?
РОСС: It was, it was okay.
ДЖОУИ: Just okay. Did you do it right?!
РОСС: Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?
ДЖОУИ: Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?
РОСС: Oh-oh, absolutely!
РОСС: It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
ДЖОУИ: But you got to be with both of them, right?
РОСС: Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
ДЖОУИ: Not the other one?
РОСС: No, she kept kicking me away!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you don’t want that.
РОСС: No!
ДЖОУИ: Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
РОСС: Oh I a lot of stuff!
ДЖОУИ: You got a little bored?
РОСС: A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? What did ya have?
РОСС: Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard.
ДЖОУИ: Sounds good.
РОСС: It really was!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
МОНИКА: Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you uh, want to do something tonight?
МОНИКА: Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when.
МОНИКА: Are you okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
МОНИКА: Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, Can the doctor see me now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I bet he can.
МОНИКА: Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you’re okay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh! My God! Barry!

НЕДРУГ: Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Jack! Hey!
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing here?
ФИБИ: All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Well, you were fired.
ФИБИ: Nu-uh!
НЕДРУГ: I told that guy who answered your phone.
ФИБИ: Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count. Anyway, I’ll be in my office.
НЕДРУГ: Uh, Phoebe you-you don’t have an office.
ФИБИ: That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, listen.
ФИБИ: You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake.
НЕДРУГ: You lost 13 million dollars.
ФИБИ: Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that. Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
НЕДРУГ: Are you all right?
ФИБИ: I’m having another heart attack!
НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: I’m having another heart attack! Call 9-1-1!
НЕДРУГ: Take it easy.
ФИБИ: Dumbass!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Pheebs! How’s it going?!
ФИБИ: Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Well, welcome back!
ФИБИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi Ross!
РОСС: Hey Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is Joey Tribbiani here?
РОСС: Umm, no.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
РОСС: That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sit down!
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
РОСС: We’re sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
РОСС: Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw what are you?! A detective?
РОСС: Look II don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who are these men?
РОСС: Men. I guy I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
РОСС: She is not. She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good day for married people huh?
РОСС: I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.
РОСС: Try telling my wife that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay to come in?
МОНИКА: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
МОНИКА: What?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I’m the ruptured spleen.
МОНИКА: Why would you do that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because you shouldn’t be with him. You should be with me.
МОНИКА: Really?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.
МОНИКА: Chandler!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a doctor!
МОНИКА: There was just one woman, wasn’t there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, there were two.
МОНИКА: Including me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah.
