ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
ДЖОУИ: Sure, neighbor come on in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, is Janine around?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, no, she’s at dance class.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can I check out what she did to my room?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God. What is th, it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It’s spreading already.
ДЖОУИ: It is?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
ДЖОУИ: All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes talk to her. Be a man.
ДЖОУИ: I’m a man.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Defend yourself.
ДЖОУИ: Hmm.
МОНИКА: Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
МОНИКА: Hey guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
МОНИКА: It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ohh, yeah.
РОСС: Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
РОСС: The one that always stares at me when I come in?
МОНИКА: No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
РОСС: Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don’t you set us up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
ФИБИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.
ФИБИ: Oh my God. What happened?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: II, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
ФИБИ: Well that’s great! Congratulations!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. A year ago.
ФИБИ: You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
МОНИКА: I don’t think mine likes me either.
РОСС: Maybe it’s a universal thing?
ДЖОУИ: Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah let’s head off to work.
МОНИКА: We should go.
ФИБИ: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure.
ФИБИ: Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
ФИБИ: Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What!?! You kissed him?
ФИБИ: Totally.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe are you serious?
ФИБИ: Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?
ФИБИ: No!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe.
ФИБИ: What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? No, yeah, I should.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
НЕДРУГ: No, I just thought it was cute.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of. Okay, uhh. Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s too girly.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh. Like what?
ДЖОУИ: Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We.we can’t have that.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.
ДЖОУИ: Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
НЕДРУГ: Well I just thought.
ДЖОУИ: I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on, and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
НЕДРУГ: It’s a curling iron.
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook.and smells different.
НЕДРУГ: It’s clean.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, well, it feels different.
НЕДРУГ: It’s dry.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels. Also what is with these chips you bought?
НЕДРУГ: No no no no, it’s pot-pourri. You’re supposed to smell it.
ДЖОУИ: Well that’s like summer in a bowl.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Kim, Hi.
НЕДРУГ: Uhh-huh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you know, I. I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
НЕДРУГ: I didn’t read it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ahh. So. Wow. The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
НЕДРУГ: Tell me everything.
РОСС: Hey guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РОСС: What’s up?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know. Oh My God.
МОНИКА: What happened to your teeth.
РОСС: I whitened them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really.
РОСС: Yeah. What do you think.
МОНИКА: Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
РОСС: Come on, seriously.
МОНИКА: Ross they’re really, really, really white.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, what was wrong with your old, human teeth.
РОСС: Ahh, II did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
МОНИКА: How much longer?
РОСС: AA day.
МОНИКА: Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
РОСС: I know. That’s why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no no no. You’ll be fine. Hillary’s blind, right?
МОНИКА: She will be after tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
РОСС: Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything.ahh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
МОНИКА: Oh my god.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I am proud of all my friends today.
МОНИКА: My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy.
МОНИКА: Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
ФИБИ: Hey. Here. Ohh, who’s the silver fox?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
ФИБИ: That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ФИБИ: Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.
ФИБИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Go. Oh.and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: To get you to make out with him!
ФИБИ: Ohhh.
МОНИКА: Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
РОСС: I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
МОНИКА: Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.
РОСС: Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
МОНИКА: I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
РОСС: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.
МОНИКА: Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
РОСС: But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?
МОНИКА: Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
РОСС: What?
МОНИКА: All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
РОСС: No. I am not putting on makeup.
ФИБИ: Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH! Demon! Demon!
МОНИКА: Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
МОНИКА: Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
МОНИКА: You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
МОНИКА: Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
МОНИКА: When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No thanks, Josephine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Ross, I was wondering if. Oh my God! Where are all the men?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, hi, Kim.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.
НЕДРУГ: You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.
НЕДРУГ: That’s not true?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
НЕДРУГ: Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
НЕДРУГ: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: II don’t want your job. II don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Ralph.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Kim.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, nothing happened. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
НЕДРУГ: And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
РОСС: MmmHmm.
НЕДРУГ: And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
РОСС: Mmm.
НЕДРУГ: You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
РОСС: MmHmm.
НЕДРУГ: After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?
РОСС: HmmHmm.
НЕДРУГ: I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?
РОСС: MmmUnmm.
НЕДРУГ: Come on. I want to know.
РОСС: HmmHmmHmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. II came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
ДЖОУИ: So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
МОНИКА: Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
ДЖОУИ: Ohh, I love birds.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What is the matter with you?!?
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You’re turning into a women.
ДЖОУИ: No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
ДЖОУИ: It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it. Oh My God, I’m a women!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
ФИБИ: But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
ФИБИ: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?
ФИБИ: Just for a second.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
ФИБИ: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.
ФИБИ: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That wouldn’t help me.
ФИБИ: Ohh, yes it would.
НЕДРУГ: I’ve had a really good time tonight.
РОСС: Mmm.
НЕДРУГ: You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
РОСС: HmmHmmHmm. Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know.
НЕДРУГ: Are you going to eat that bread?
РОСС: Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
НЕДРУГ: You make me laugh.
РОСС: HmmHmm.
НЕДРУГ: Would you like to move over to the couch?
РОСС: MmmHmm.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.
РОСС: How about all the way.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
НЕДРУГ: Are those your teeth?
РОСС: Ohh, you can see them, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Yes. They’re insanely white.
РОСС: II, did that for you.
НЕДРУГ: What’s a matter with you?
РОСС: What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Kim, hi.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Okay. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, he dumped me. He said, Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry. And then I don’t know why but he said, and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.
НЕДРУГ: You expect me to believe. Hi Ralph.
НЕДРУГ: Hi Kim.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.
НЕДРУГ: Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You and Ralph?
НЕДРУГ: Kenny the copyboy.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter? Are you upset?
ДЖОУИ: I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.
ДЖОУИ: Great! Great! and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ДЖОУИ: And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
НЕДРУГ: Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
