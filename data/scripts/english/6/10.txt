ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s a good story, Grandpa. 
РОСС: Hey 
НЕДРУГ: Hey 
РОСС: Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or? 
МОНИКА: Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love. 
ФИБИ: That is nice and we’re done. TADA! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me. 
МОНИКА: Oh, here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See now it feels like Christmas! 
РОСС: ...and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. 
ДЖОУИ: Hey you guys. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe what’s up? 
ДЖОУИ: I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like... 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can see why that’s hard to resist. 
ДЖОУИ: I like her so much! 
МОНИКА: Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way. 
ДЖОУИ: I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right? 
РОСС: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys! 
РОСС: Hi Janine! 
НЕДРУГ: I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve. 
МОНИКА: Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, that’s what I said. 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? 
НЕДРУГ: Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of the party people. 
РОСС: You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most! 
НЕДРУГ: Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner? 
ДЖОУИ: Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you. 
НЕДРУГ: Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why. 
РОСС: Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that. 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too? 
РОСС: Are you serious? 
МОНИКА: We are there! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What, what are you laughing at? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her! 
НЕДРУГ: Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later! 
НЕДРУГ: Bye! 
РОСС: Bye Janine! 
ДЖОУИ: Did she just ask me out on a date? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t think so. 
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. 
РОСС: It was a dry day. 
МОНИКА: We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve! 
РОСС: Oh my God! 
МОНИКА: Oh my God! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God! 
ДЖОУИ: OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember....stay cool. 
РОСС: Got it! 
РОСС: Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it! 
НЕДРУГ: OK, everyone gather up. 
НЕДРУГ: ‘Scuse us 
НЕДРУГ: Here’s what’s gonna happen. The music’s gonna start, you’re gonna dance, we’re gonna tape, you don’t look at the camera. Any questions? 
РОСС: Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air? 
НЕДРУГ: Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out. 
ДЖОУИ: Ross! So when is it gonna air? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can save you time ladies, I’m right here. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? That’s terrible! 
ФИБИ: No-no, we do it every year! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh well, that makes it not terrible. 
ФИБИ: No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents! 
ФИБИ: But we have to! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too. 
ФИБИ: Well then, you should look with us. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I have a great idea for a present for her. 
ФИБИ: Oh, that’s it? A great idea! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I help, we can find ‘em faster! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That’s right! 
ФИБИ: Ooh ooh, we have a live one! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag! 
ФИБИ: Ooh, who’s it for? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you. 
ФИБИ: Uh-oh. She may be onto us. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We are so gonna find them this year. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? 
НЕДРУГ: No, we never do that 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! 
МОНИКА: Okay, here comes another camera. 
РОСС: Right. No biggie. Stay loose. 
РОСС: Why do they keep doing that? 
МОНИКА: If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day. 
РОСС: Right. 
РОСС: Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there? 
НЕДРУГ: We learned how to dance. 
МОНИКА: Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants? 
РОСС: Yeah! 
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You’re a good dancer! 
ДЖОУИ: Really? 
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little. 
ДЖОУИ: What do you mean? 
НЕДРУГ: Like this. 
НЕДРУГ: That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there. 
ДЖОУИ: No-no-no-no-no we came together! 
НЕДРУГ: I don’t see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! 
ДЖОУИ: No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot. 
НЕДРУГ: Really, y’think so? I don’t.. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats. 
ФИБИ: Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Those are my gifts, I got them for you. 
ФИБИ: Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Those are book ends! That's a great gift! 
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ha! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey! 
ДЖОУИ: Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers! 
РОСС: We know! 
МОНИКА: Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him. 
РОСС: Okay. 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, everybody hold! 
НЕДРУГ: Next on the platforms are......you two! And... You two! 
МОНИКА: Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants? 
РОСС: Monica! Would it? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with. 
НЕДРУГ: She’s nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown, I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.. 
НЕДРУГ: No I don’t think so. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow! 
НЕДРУГ: Look, are you dating this girl you came with? 
ДЖОУИ: Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know... 
НЕДРУГ: No, no. She’s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy! 
ДЖОУИ: Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! 
НЕДРУГ: God! What are you, in second grade? 
ДЖОУИ: Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. 
МОНИКА: Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then? 
РОСС: Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform! 
МОНИКА: What? 
РОСС: The routine! 
МОНИКА: Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school. 
РОСС: Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform! 
МОНИКА: Was it really that good? 
РОСС: We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice? 
МОНИКА: Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced! 
МОНИКА: 5 6 7 8! 
РОСС: So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next? 
НЕДРУГ: Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that! 
МОНИКА: Yes! 
НЕДРУГ: Make sure you get this, they’re gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it’s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody’s excitement. 
НЕДРУГ: Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner. 
НЕДРУГ: What’s going on over here? 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard? 
НЕДРУГ: What’s the matter with you? Get out of here! 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, take a hike wetpants! 
РОСС: Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment! 
МОНИКА: I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you? 
РОСС: No! 
МОНИКА: Me too! 
РОСС: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe going into the robot, y’know? 
МОНИКА: Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid! 
НЕДРУГ: Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny. 
НЕДРУГ: Three, Two, One! 
НЕДРУГ: Cut! 
ДЖОУИ: No! Year! Happy No Year! 
НЕДРУГ: Okay, here’s where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that’s a wrap! 
ФИБИ: Hey! Look who I found! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hey guys! 
ФИБИ: Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. 
ФИБИ: Or we could just follow your clever jokes... any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage? 
ФИБИ: Hmm, how about my azzz? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, this is hollow. 
ФИБИ: What? 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!! 
ФИБИ: No, don’t look directly at them! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What? 
ФИБИ: Alright, no, we could look at them! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, this one’s for me! 
ФИБИ: Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh great! 
ФИБИ: And the big one’s for me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, let’s open them! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay! Okay! Okay! 
ФИБИ: Hee hee! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait, we can’t do this. 
НЕДРУГ: Why? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about. 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine. 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back? 
ФИБИ: Will you get us better gifts? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine! 
МОНИКА: Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier? 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s what you got me? 
ФИБИ: Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless. 
ДЖОУИ: Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night! 
НЕДРУГ: Joey. 
ДЖОУИ: Yeah? 
НЕДРУГ: 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year. 
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yoii. What was that for? 
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you 
ДЖОУИ: Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment. 
НЕДРУГ: In the moment, yeah. 
ДЖОУИ: But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again? 
НЕДРУГ: Sure, New Year’s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait? 
ДЖОУИ: No. 
НЕДРУГ: Me neither. 
ДЖОУИ: 3, 2, 
НЕДРУГ: Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss. 
ДЖОУИ: Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready. 
МОНИКА: We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’ 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade? 
МОНИКА: Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me! 
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then! 
МОНИКА: What? We could do it! 
РОСС: I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then. 
МОНИКА: I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. 
НЕДРУГ: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 
МОНИКА: I can’t do it! 
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now you do that, you’re on TV.
