Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! Hi, sure! Oh God, well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden Sweet 'n' Lo? I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but. Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue. Daddy, I just. I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a a purse, y'know? Or a or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha It's a metaphor, Daddy! Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait! Wait, I said maybe! I'm all better now. Please, no, go, that'd be fine! Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't, it isn't, it's about me, and I ju Hi, machine cut me off again, anyway. Oh see, but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference! Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life. Hello, Paul. So, like, you guys all have jobs? Wow! Would I have seen you in anything? I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. Oh, yeah. Oh wow. Are you in trouble. Oh, look, wish me luck! I'm gonna go get one of those job things. Guess what? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today. You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off! They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots! Uh, credit card. Um, my, father. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Thank you. I don't think so. You gonna crash on the couch? Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What? Sorry. No, you have it, really, I don't want it. Okay. I knew. I did. Yeah, maybe. Goodnight. Would anybody like more coffee? I'm just serving it. Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. Has anybody seen my engagement ring? Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God. Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him. 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder. I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with. Ohhhhh, don't be mad. Oh, I am sorry. Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? So what are you gonna do? You're twins? All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. The lights, please. I'm just cleaning up. Uh, okay, sure! Thanks! Oh, a little. A lot. So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been dumped? Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow. When did it get so complicated? Remember when we were in high school together? I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love and that'd be it?. Ross? Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here. Barry? Are you sure? I'm uh I'm okay. You look great! I dumped him. Oh, not much. II got a job. Why are why are you so tanned? Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! Oh! Well, um. You've got plugs! And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! Okay. Wow. What? Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me. Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. II saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel SO much better now. What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? Since when? And everybody knows this? Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey. Coffee black. Late. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! Good for me! Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! Chandler, what are you doing? This Alan again? How's it goin'? Well, then can we meet him? What bank is this? And did you notice? What future boyfriends? Nono, I th I think this could be, y'know, it. I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. It's worse than the thumb! Well, II could live without it. Indeed there isn't. I should really get back to work. Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. God, he's good. Yeah. I think he's across the hall. Uh, Joey. We didn't change. I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up I wanted him to meet my family. Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?. That was fun. See, there's always one guy. If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. Look look look look look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! God, isn't this exciting? I earned this.

They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me!

Come on Louisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here. Take it! Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?

Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'. Nooo. Hey. What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card? Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing. Which one do you think she is? What does she mean? She could be you. What? You just click when they click. Nope. We took her to lunch. No way. No way did you do this. Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh, somebody will. Where the hell've you been? Are you drunk?! Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried. Monica? Monica! Yes, yes, it does.

What? I don't know where the phone is. Ross? What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there. Rossy, Rossy. Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction. What, it's ok when Chandler does it? Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips. And if you need anything else, I--do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm uh Rachel Green. I'm Carol's ex-husband's sister's roommate. Oh, that's funny! Hey. Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by? Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him? Yeah, why? No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok? Ok? Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.

These are for you. Welcome to our country. Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp. You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes! And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about. Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? Yeah, sure. Did you talk to him? Then, no. Here's your lemonade. Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out? Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have. I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here. Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec? Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night. At his apartment. Is this juice? I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser. Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem? I'm glad it's not a problem. How is she? I'm ok. When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me. Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie? I don't know, I don't know. Wait, are you leaving? Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what? No. No, I think that was the whole all. No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes. You're welcome. Yeah, I forget which ones. Thank you. What a bitch. Hey, guys, what's up. Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? You went shopping for fur? You bought boobs? Oh, this is so cute. Did you just say Hi, Jew? Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person. They took Ben to the park. Where've you been? Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars? And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket. Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with? Who? What? You were with Julie? Oh. Oh my god. Yeah, right. Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. Well that works out good, because I'm not listening. Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife? Yes. Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you. I love you too. I'd do anything for you, you know that. So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right? Really? Me? Well, you're not totally paranoid. Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right. Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch. Come on, they were not that huge. You don't have birds. All right, bye-bye. Oh, my, god. We won. We won! How did this happen? Ok, so let's talk money. Have you ever seen so much crap? Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this. What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is really cool. Well, what about my stuff? You still think of it as your apartment, don't you? Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room. Ok, while you mmm on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp. What? Monica, let it go. Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps. I am. Let me just get my coat. Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken? Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp. Ok, you win. Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with. She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them. Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone. You are ready to make a commitment! What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break? Thank you. It's really not that big! Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys. Hi, hi can I help you? Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her. What? What! Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special. Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it. Bye-bye Julie. Hey. Hey, c'mon, cut it out. What? Sure. What? C'mon, talk to me. Why? Who's not having. Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? No, no no no, don't need to know the details. No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? I think it's sexy. Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? I'd wait. Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait, then I'd wait some more. Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. More than jewelry. Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing? What did, what did he say? Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here. No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie? Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything. So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like? Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh. Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? What? So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous? Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce? Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. Maybe you should put it off. I know, yeah, sorry. Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that. Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. Ohh, God. Hi, Julie. Yeah, whoosh! So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight? Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do? For Ross, Ross, Ross. Hey. What? Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet. Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching. Ok, I will have the uh, side salad. Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water? Um, everyone? Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable. That's 'cause you have it. Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing. Ok. Thank you. Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. Ok, we never shoulda talked about this. Me neither. What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together? Fine. Happy birthday. Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours? Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad? On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey? What party? Who gave you that hickey? Oh! What, as part of your poor friends outreach program? Oh! Ok. What's up? But what about Phoebe? Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her. Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her? Honey, I'm sorry. Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying Terry's a jerk! That's where that came from. Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything. Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine. Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it. Done. Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe? What? Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional. Well, but Pheebs. Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to. Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer. Hey. Here. I thought you might be cold. Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well. Do you? Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for Smelly Cat. Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. So, how was the party. Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night? Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look? What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight. Yeah, Monica's settin' me up. Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, ya know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity. Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on, he can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing. Together? Both of you? Together. Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time. Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date, with a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really uh, have a really good night and you two have a uh, have a uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave. How long do cats live? Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't, you know, throw 'em under a bus or something? That's just great. Oh, right, clink. Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend. I mean he just started going out with her. Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you. OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

What're they called, what're they called, what're they called? Yes! Thank you. Oh, you're not having fun, are you? Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his Julie. I just want to get over him gosh, why can't I do that? Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that? Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel, woo. Hello, excuse me. Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute. I can see that. I, just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone. Thank you. OK Machine. Just waiting for the beep. Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that uhm, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. Ahhhh. Uhmm, I think there was a restraunt, I know there was wine. I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember. Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me? Huh. Oh yeah, go ahead. Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. Ohh God. Ohh, ohh. Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. Yeah, what, so, you had feelings for me first. Chandler told me. When you were in China. Meeting Julie. Are you over me? Wait, so, you're going? OK, OK. Hi. Oh, that's um, interesting. Alright, I got it Ross. What? Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me. Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night. Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point? Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. Good. And ya know what, now I've got closure. It was unbelievable! Oh, it ended very well. Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it. No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair. Hey, you. Good. How are you? Hey. Did uh, Ross call? Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together. Oh my god. Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth. Hey, do you guys have hi. Where you goin'? Oh. Well, what's the other thing, what do I think? Really? Oh, god. Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good. Let me get my coat. Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that? What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it? Well what is it? Let me see. Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see. And I'm in it? Then let me read it. Come on. All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it. All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. What is this? Ross, what is this? Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled? Just a waitress? Oh! I do not have chubby ankles! She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress. When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape. Not interested. No. That's what I said. No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking. No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you. Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go! Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list. Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down. Hey. Uhh, the mailman, the super. What? Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section. Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me? Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison. How have you never been on Oprah? Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas. No, nothin'. Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. Wha, forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. Oh, gosh, it's hot in here. Did you just break the radiator? I'll call the super. Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? What, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight. Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom. Mr. Treeger. Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna. Yeah, I'm with Mon. What'cha gonna' do? Nice seizing, gel boy. Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil. Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil. Wiper blades. I don't even have a car. Joey, would you slow down, they're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning. Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about. We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. I had one glass. OK, so that's, that's what, two bottles, and yet somehow we went through five? Ehhumm, I don't know, why don't you taste it. Oh, well too late, sorry, you already had some. Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna get some cake. Uhmm, well actually I'm already done, but I, I kinda got plans. Yeah, I uhh, I have a, I have a date. What, what is so strange about me having a date? Noo, no, I'm not mad at him, I'm, I'm not really anything at him anymore. I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm, not. Oh I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross. Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ. What's the matter? What, isn't he sober? Ohhh, OK. Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there. Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK. Hi. Hu-ahh, waitressing? Huh, Bob Sagett? Oh. Well, we're not seeing each other, so. Well, yeah, this is the deal. Um, Russ, you ready? Bye. What? No, Phoebs, I'm dating Russ. Steve sleeve. Pheobe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than there names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Did Joey say what he was gonna do when he left? I don't know, who would I have to sleep with? Why would I have to sleep with you? Oh God, even his knock is boring. What happened? Did I miss it? Did I miss it? I'm sorry, what? That's great! What do you mean? Ok, who ordered what? Oh god. I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know? Mom! Pretty much. This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. Oh Mom! Really? Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? For me. Well, what do you mean? Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick. None. No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this. Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? These are from Halloween three years ago. No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. Actually, what I think you said was, don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen. Hey, Mon, you want some help? She's still with you? God! Oh! What's new in sex? Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? You want me to talk you out of it? Then what? What do you want? Why on earth would I understand this? Oh. Hey, Mom? Having fun? There's more alcohol, right? I had a wedding. Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. And she's not crazy? Oh my God. Not at all inappropriate! Well, so what're you gonna do? No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens. Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina? Oh, I know, I know. Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. You're kidding. OK. Now just how big of a star is Marcel? What what what what? Ya think? No, was he any good in it? Wow, so why don't you go talk to him? What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen? OK, I'm doin' it for ya. Excuse me. Hi. Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute. I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her? Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no. He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking. JeanClaude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you. And then JeanClaude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore. Does anybody need anything? That is so unfair. Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set? That is the most ridiculous. I did not sell you out. Would you let me talk. OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus Ow. That hurt. Ow, you stop flicking. Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want? You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want? Oh that's what you want. Fine. No. No. OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater. OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara. Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute. I'll help you throw out your purse. Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him. OK, well, bye. OK, well, bye-bye again. Impressive. Oh yeah. Hi. Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see. What, what incident? What? What are you, what are you doin'? What? Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me? OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save. What? OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again? Ross, there is no us, OK. No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it. NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that. No, no, ACC-cept that. Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? Hi. Oh my God. They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum. Oh.

You didn't get one. That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it. Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.

Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you'r loving, you make me laugh. ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'l just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes. RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was. ROSS: Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even not even like, like chipmunk sex?RACHEL: Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo. ROSS: Knock-knock. But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.

No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. Yes, my wind.

One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes. Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be. What was the book? Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left.

Why, when did you get out of the game? Oh no. Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry. I, I don't have it. Nobody does honey. Look at her. Agh, it was the graduation from hell. Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica. My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner. Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you. Now I love you even more. Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great. Wow you, you. I had no idea. No, I knew. What? Why. Daddy. Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here? I can't believe this is happening. I do. Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes. What? Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while. Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok. Well those are very popular frames. Yeah, like a chimney. You want me to see a therapist? Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing. Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff. This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this? Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July. It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just. Oh ok. Ok. Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true. Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left. You went out with a guy in the Navy? So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time? Well I've had it. Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you. You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights. Oh, stop that, stop that right now. No sorry hon, Monica's orders. And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you. So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to? Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys. It was nice to meet you. So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things? Oh yeah. Ok. Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-. Hey sailor. I'll say. Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light. Hey Joey, how'd the audition go? Yeah, right. I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous. Because I promised Mindy I would. Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-ofHonor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself. Nooo! Wow! What's that like? Afraid to ask him? Hey! Hi. Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time. God I know, you're right. Okay, I'll see you after the thing. Thank you, Okay, Okay. Why the hell didn't you tell me! Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes. Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you. Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg. Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today. Oh, hi! I know. Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min. Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about? Insane! What?! What. Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? Oh dear God. See you in the parking lot. Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least one of your weddings. See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except. Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would. marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody. At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa. Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here. Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy. Ooooh! Wow! Oh, hi. How come you didn't come over earlier? Yeah, I just have to get dressed. Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.

Let's just get you out of that. Come on. Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress? Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?! Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night. Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep. Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days. Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight. No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you. Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants? But I. All right. I'm not gonna gooo. No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence. I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going. Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood. It's fine. I'm not mad. I'm just not going. Right. Um, hum. No. Right. Right, and the humiliating. Um, hum. Right. Yes, Ross. No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting. I think you should drink the fat. No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go! You were really gonna do that, weren't you? You were gonna drink the fat. And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds. Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way. I'm going commando, too.

Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases. Yeah, you do. This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof. Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof. Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser. Oh. G. I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that? Yeah, it is. Shhh. I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented. Yeah. Yes, and grumpy. He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now. Hey Pheebs. Any sign of your brother? I thought you only met him once? Well relax, he'll be here. Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing. Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league? Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr, Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson. Hardy Boy. What about you honey, who would be on your list? Hi! Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans? Three of your five, what? Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought. So? Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography. Well, it's about time. All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel? Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice. Oh! Come on! Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak. Oh-oh, you lie. Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me. You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate. Okay. Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn. Excuse me, there was no time! Does anybody need more coffee? Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is. That’s all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh? Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. Yeah, I know. Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some, meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see. Yeah, so? Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much. Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody? Oh, but that’s okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city? Okay! Bye! Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now. What? Oh, sorry. Um, Barry. I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda. 'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.' Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay. Ross, my father doesn't hate you. But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like. Thank you. Hi Daddy! You remember Ross. Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster. Okay. Aw honey stop! It's not that bad. Yeah. That's Daddy. Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers. So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change. Well um, I don't. Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that. Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't. You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone. Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already. Um. yeah. All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice. Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here. Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me? Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too! Hi Daddy. What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here. What?! He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor. Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. Well that's his last name. It's Robert Bobby. And um, excuse me, he helps me. With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other. What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter. I'm sorry, let her? No. Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet. Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? Phoebe, what? Umm what?! And all these people actually died? Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go. I promise. Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him. Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me? Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored. Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?! We're not?! All right, I like that. So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump. I cannot push it in! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Or. We could put a hat on his head. We need a hat. Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'! Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though. Okay. Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today. Right. See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I? Okay, I heard that. Uh-huh. Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now. Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it. Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I. What?! I also said number one. Hi! He's perfect, he's never been better. Well maybe he's just taking a nap. Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive. Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child. I did! I did! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing! I hope it's still funny when you're in hell. I'll get the hat. Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device. No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. Oh! That would be sooo much fun! Let's do it! Ross? Do you wanna play football? Um, there was a Geller Cup? Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me. That almost hit me in the face. Monica, I'm your best friend. Ross! You don't pick me! You're stuck with me! Are you okay? Over here! I almost caught that one! Wait, what am I gonna do? Wait, how long? Okay. Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle. Can I see that for second. Now, does it really matter? All right, so are we not having dinner at all? I went really long. I can not believe your trading me! Are you gonna let me play? Yeah! Kill 'um! No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me. God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too. Thank you! Break! I'm so sorry! Are you okay? I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do. Okay. I got a touchdown! We did it! We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something. Oh shoot! I work Monday nights. What? Yeah. Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new? Eh, do you believe that? I'm gonna get back to retraining. Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too. Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry. I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks. Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that. Well, I'm also sending out, good thoughts. The fear? Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'? I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer. Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here. Yeah. Can't I just look at the handles on them? Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice. Gunther, I quit. Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers. Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?! I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting. You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear. No. Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey. Thanks. Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me. I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin, swans. Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you! I got the job! Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy. Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again. Wow. Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor. Good luck. Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan. I know! Op. Oh, you got me. Oh, that sounds great. Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much. Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it. Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in. Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't. I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom. Hi! Is my misery amusing to you? It's not funny, this is actually my job. Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger. Yes?! Do you want my pickle? The most unbelievable thing happened to me today. Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview! I know! Uh-huh! Yeah! His name is um, Mark something. What!? To be nice. I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell. Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job. I mean that's unbelievable. Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings. That's all right. Hey. Did he call? Did Mark call? Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe? Music. Very nice. So, how are you? Oh yeah, what's it about? Yeah, I do. I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call. Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy. Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview! He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it. I got to figure out what I'm going to wear. Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo! Hey! What are you doing here? Oh. Hi. Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up. Me too! I know. Yeah. Yeah. Hi Mark! Oh, I did! Oh my God! Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down. Honey, I'm sorry. Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes? Tell him. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs. No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today. Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out. Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox? Oh. Yeah. What kind of discount do we get? Oh! I love this job! Wow! My first call. Hi honey! Oh, he's just goofing around. Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants. Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do? I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you! Ow! Ross! Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm. Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic. Yes. All right Ross! I get it! You're hurt! Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk! Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do. Ohhh! That is soo sweet! Ross! So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? Right. Hello. A big idiot. Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now? Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. Where ya going? Ohh, with who? There was a woman at the. The stripper?! You have a play date with a stripper?! Sure, is she married? Oh. Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own? I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I. Ugh. Wait, wait, wait. Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. Oh my God, I gotta go to work! Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late. I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay? For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work. I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past. Right. Somebody got in late last night. When did this happen? Monica, what are you doing? Hey. Do you have any ice? Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day? Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer? How often do you read it? Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining? Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women. All right. Okay. Yeah. Oh, Danny just went into room 217. Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it! Joey! I can't believe you just did that! All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy. Eh. Beth dies. Um-hmm. What?! No. She doesn't die. Because, I wanted to hurt you. Oh my. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up. What? Awwww. Joey? Do you want to put the book in the freezer? Okay. Hi, sweetie! I've got some bad news. I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here. Nooo, he's leaving for a better job. Well we're gonna miss you around here. Yeah, you bet. Funny book? Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind. Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark. Oh my God! Ross! Because, he's my friend. Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. Really!? Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What? Oh. Nodded off! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks! Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!' Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah. Oh, that is so. Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark? It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, III like that you're not involved in that part of my life. Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay? What?! Hello. Oh, hi. Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night. No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with. No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And. What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding. Oh! My God, what are you doing here? Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but II got a crisis. Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop. But I don't, hmm. Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone! Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I. None for me. I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's. Oh my God! Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing? Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop. I don't have ten minutes! Hey, Ross! I told you I don't! Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later. Good bye! Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier. I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger! But I told you, I didn't have the time! Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit me job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? Just a job! Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that. Well neither do I! Oh my God. Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard. I don't know, I don't know. Look, maybe we should take a break. No. A break from us. Hello! Oh. No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi! Yeah. Well, umm. Yeah, I'm fine. No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay. Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry. Oh. Okay, bye. Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break. No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there. Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over. Hello. Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called. Nobody. Umm, honey, look he just came over to. Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home. You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend? Oh my God. Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break. No. A break from us. Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break. Nobody. Umm, honey, look he just came over to. Hey. Well, we never actually got to dinner. No, we kinda broke up instead. God, Monica it’s on the ceiling. Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over. No. No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work. Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid. Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine. So, I love you. And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30. Bye. Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now! Just get away from me! A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?! Ross, you had sex with another woman! Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! Just get out! Now! Okay! All right! How was she? Was she good? Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it! How was she? Good different? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?! And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship! We were on a break! You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality? Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake! God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther! Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again. All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me? You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were. I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza. Fine. Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza. With ah, extra anchovies. Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce? Well, I should think so. You slept with someone. That’s. That is neither here nor there. No Ross! Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay? I think you should go. I really think you need to go now. Yeah, what the hell did I know! No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever. Then how come it is? Hey! Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee. Closer than here? Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee. Is he here? Oh. Here’s your moisturiser. Hi! You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right? Oh, well okay. Well, there you go. Hm-mm. Ohh! Oh, it’s okay. And heels. No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?! I mean I’m playing by the rules. Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?! Okay. No. Thank you. Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ Well, if everybody’s going. What?! What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, III actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra. No, I stuff outside the bra. Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there. What, what’s it, what’s going on? So you know how to fix it? Great! Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27. I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here. Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us. No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here! No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else. Op, op, car! Car! Ugh! What is he doing here?! All right! Fine! Fine. Ask me what? You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come. Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier. All right, let’s go! Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else? Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine! What?! Really Joey? No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here. Yeah. Thank you. Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since. What’s your problem? Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City. Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks. Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this. Oh my God! Great! Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know. I think you should definitely go out with this guy. Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger? All right. Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya? Yeah? Thank you. Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable. We use it! Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire. Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real 20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting. Oh yeah, sure, that too. Oh my God! The millionaire’s here! Hi! Just one drink?! Thank you. Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’! Oh, okay. Wow! Umm. I know. Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no. I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something. I don’t have any issues with my Father. Hi! Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here. No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think? Yeah? Good. Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop. Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug. You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt! Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty. Petty. Petty. Small. You are so just doing this out of spite. Huh? You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15! It doesn’t even fit you anymore! yeah-yeah-yeah! Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’ Y'know what? I can’t do this. Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you. Oh God. I’m sorry about this. You sure? Hey! Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair. Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and. No. Nothing. Hey, Sophie! Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here. Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office? Summer catalogue! Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna. Bye, Chandler. Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore. No! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone! Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too? Hey! I need to talk to you! Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler. Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you. That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all? Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me. Wow! What’s this? All right! O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. Hmm. What?! Oh, I. Oh, I know. Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her? You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’ Well, they always called. No. Sorry. Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss. Well. No. I. Call her! Call her now! Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy! Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her! Well then you’re going to have to take her out again. I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! That’s fine! I know. Sophie’s desk. Chandler! Are you gonna call her! Chandler! Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates? What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass? And you’re still not attracted to him at all? Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher. Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday. I know. Ow! Got a job on a river boat? Oh I see, so this suit is making a point. Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like. Yeah, come here! Yeah. Oh!

Look, either help me or go. Okay, but before you go, could you help me first? Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too? Okay. Let’s use this brush. Yeah. Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it. Oh-ho! Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye! Okay, just sweep it. Right. Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t. We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle. Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this? Blow it. Sophisticated like a hooker? Sure. Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing. Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed? Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around. I don’t want you to see me naked! Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird. What? Ross! Stop that! Come on!

Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl! Yes. Yes. I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! What? Oh! Oh, I can’t watch this. I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex? That is so cool. Ohh, big, fat bummerrr. Hey! Ross gave it to me. Ohh, thank you. Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back. Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat! Allll done! Okay, who's next?! Come on, please?!

Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers! All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas! I'm just making margaritas. What?! Oh, come on! Monica, please? He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something. Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?! Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night? Oh, great. I'm going for a walk. Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading. Ohhhh, sorry I missed that. Ohh-ha-ha! Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald. Ohh! Really?! I mean you definitely should do that. Yeah! Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head! Aww Pheebs, that sucks! Hi! That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge. Hey! Come on see, she doesn't look that bad. I don't know. All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else? Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you! Noo. Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me! Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so. I just, I feel, II just. I feel. Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs. Oh, you're welcome a million. Oh my God. Whoa! What?! Why?! Here?! Now?! Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood? Whoa-ho. I don't know. Oh, making it worse! Oh, was it awful? I wrote you a letter. It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff. Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done. Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up? You just finished? So umm, does it? Does it? What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it. Are you sure? I know. How was the beach? Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does? All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there? Oh-hooo, I missed you. Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater. Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective. Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for! What?! You fell asleep?! Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over! Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica! Sorry! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me! And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal! Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep. Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants? I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy. Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this? Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh. Why? I love that thing. Something to do with numbers? What? You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?! Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews? Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me! Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch! I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?! Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school. They had to have that specially made?! Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot! Oh, you go out with him. Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy? I believe it. Yes, I do. Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right. Jurassic Park could happen. You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar? You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?! Do we have to tell her? I hate when Ross is right! Pheebs. All right! Jeez! Hello, Chip. I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself. She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch? Wow! They really got you guys. Your T. V. The chairs. So, how was your date? Um-hmm. Oh honey, I'm sorry. Ohh! That's so great! I'm sorry, sweetie. You could, say you're sorry to her mom. So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl? I'll go with you. Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game. Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice? My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward. You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you? What is she doing here? I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’ Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now! Chandler! Promise me, you will end it. Thank you. That’s weird, she locked the door. Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list? What?! You promised you would break up with her! And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?! Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them. Oh, Chandler! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again! You never come into this office again! You give me back my Walkman! Well, then I lost it. You buy me one! Does it hurt? Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna? When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired! No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why. What if I clean your bathroom for a month? Foot rubs for a month! I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums! Sophie sit! No! God, would you just calm down! I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts. I ah Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning! Yeah! D’oh! I’ve got it! I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know. Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy. I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle. Ohh, not compared to you. So did you break up with Joanna? What?! It’s me! Good morning! Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I Oh my word! Oh, yeah! Yeah! Okay. What? Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full. Well, I thought you liked doing it. Right! Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger. Ummm. Oh! I m sorry. It s a little old but. I m sorry. I didn t, I don t come in here a lot. No. I didn t. I never said that. Okay, I m sorry. Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. That s easy for you to say, you weren t almost just killed. Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet? Oh! My hero! What happened? What?! You got us evicted! That s not true! Go! Well, why doesn t he practice with a girl? Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that garbage chute. Hey! So, did you quit? Oh, umm, I was just y know working out and umm, Oh, that s it. Where?! What was that? You just did a little dancy thing. You are soooo enjoying this. Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes. What are you ever gonna use that for?! You got fired?! Sweety. Yeah? May fifth, why? Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her. Well, have fun! Yeah, she's. You love her. Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross. Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64. Okay. I'll miss you. I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum. Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom? What was that? Oh. Stop it! Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh! I think he's stealing from me. Because he's stealing from me! Ughh! Well where's Amanda? I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out. Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian. Ohh, that is soo sad. Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! Sorry. Y'know. Yeah. No! Okay. Okay. Yeah, so what is she, like a, like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what? Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek. Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real! Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that? Oh, honey, that's so sweet. Oh my God! What happened? Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice. And not one of your coupons for an hour of Joey Love. No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help. Hey, how'd it go? You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one? No. Yes! Rent! What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy. What did you get her? Okay, honey, what he means by that, is while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives? Any luck? All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like, a regular pen. Aw, honey, that's so sweet. Oh! Pathetic! I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug! Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me! Thanks! Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go? Yeah, I mean, you should play in public! Oh, I can t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers. Why not? Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him. Yeah, Phoebe you re awful! I know, I remember that! Well, Chandler, you re gonna have to tell him. Because you do. Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves. What? So are things with you and Joey any better? Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh? You shouldn't. Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy. I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just. People are trying to sleep in here! Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor. Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye. I know, it's sick. Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner! Is he okay in there? So now, what exactly is the point of the box? Why? Okay. Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time. Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of? Credit. Ooh, I like those sunglasses. Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope! Sick-sick-sick-sick. Ross, can you pass me the yams? Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?! Okay, fine. Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter! Joey, had reasons. What?! Oh, he sees her! No? Oh! Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss. Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and. God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying. And that's I'm so glad there's no problem. Ohh! That's great! Really?! Well, I, umm. Thank you. Well, they uh, they-they do more than that. Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me. III of course, I have more responsibilities than that. Yes, I realize that. I love working with designers! Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview. No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you. There's nobody here! Do you want me to quit? Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day! What? My drinking? Said what? Exactly. Oh my God! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person! Say more things like that. I'd need an expense account. And an assistant. Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer? Oh my God! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy! Ohh, you've waited soo long. Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya. How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's? Yes! Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls! I'm an assistant buyer! Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already? Heard what? Oh my God! How?! Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God. Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened. Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us nothing about an assistant buyer? Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna. Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang! before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great. Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung. Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before? Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs. Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa! Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them? Pheebs, that's great! But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle. Oh yeah! Really?! So, will I like any of these guys? Chandler! Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies! Op, I like credit cards! Well, so what does he do? Your company has a fine foods division? Chandler! You have the best taste in men! Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious. Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right? You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that! Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea. Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship? You idiot! You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away! Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people! Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! Really? No. Cute guys in little shorts? Sure. Well that sounds fun too. What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?! Well you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black? Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something? Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about. Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper. Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom. I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right there, aren't you? Chandler, that is so nice. Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that? Yeah. Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave. Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree like that. Let me see that. Oh yeah. Well, you know, sometimes that helps. Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn. Oh, TOES! Yeah, for some people. Oh. Oh, I can't watch this. It's like Sophie's Choice. Oh, it was only okay. Depends who asked. Oh, Mon. Sure. Yes. You're not asking me, are you? Yes, totally. What the hell is that?! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhh! BACK OFF! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up! What is that noise? Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster. Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around. What? I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop. How many guesses do you get? No! There's no orange juice in there! We win! Okay, well, we won that one. Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions. Fine! We'll ask Phoebe. I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing. Tails! We'll take Literature! Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing! It's All Relative! I'm sorry! Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars. Monica?! Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money! Oooohh that's interesting. Throw in the duck too! Well, he gets the other one all riled up. Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this. Why? Do you have the answers written on there?

Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. That's right! You do what the hand says! How did it go? Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean! That is not true. She did! She forced me! Well it stupid, unfair question! Will you stop calling it your apartment! No it's not! Oh, I think I saw some in here. I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die. Bloomingdale's eliminated my department. No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down! Uh-huh. Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it!

Hi-e! Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there. It's Joshua. Why? Honey, what is the big deal? Yeah, that's true. Chandler, what did she say? Beefsteak Charlie's? Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that? Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. Hi! So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating! Really? It doesn't seem desperate? Hmm-mmm. Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before. No. Have you? I don't even know how I would go about it. You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we, the license? Well, that is a good idea!

He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it! Wow! Monica! Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone. Really? Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'? How does going to a strip club help him better? Um-hmm. There we go. There it is. Yeah! Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about well uh, this one is large. And this one. Yeah!

Well, II guess,I. Yeah, great, you betcha! What? Oh. Oh, right. Oh yay! Hey! Hey, Monica! Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So. What are you gonna do? No! Help me! Phoebe? Ugh! Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is, I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back? Ohh! Hi! So. Ohhhh, come on! No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please! I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me? Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily? I'm Rachel Green. There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So, Oh well, no I, I'll get her. Hey, whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow! Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face. The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep. No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep! and he let her right in. No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me. Honey, that's you're name. What? Who the hell is Emily, noooo! They're in Vermont! How could this happen?! How, how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! I don't get this! She was horrible! I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont! Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every, little, thing! Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont! I can't believe it! He still hasn't called. It's Joshua. No, I don't. Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there? See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal. Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh! Well, are we all together? Like in a group? Oh, hey! What? Oh, hmm. Joshua. Yeah, I. Oh, thank goodness! Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you. No, happy for you! No-no-no, that' not Joshua. Chandler, there's a guy right over there. Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off. Hmm. Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does? Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it? Guess who we ran into today?! You are not. You have never been able to break up with her. Hey! Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light. It's coming from Joey! Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know. Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him. You are not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened? No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse. What are these? Okay, okay, okay should I be scared? Wow! If only more people knew. Hey! What-what are-what are these? Oh my God! Look at this! I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head! And did you?! Oh my God. Hello, Mrs. Chatracus. Thank God. Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket. Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted. Yeah? Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store. Well, that’s because of a lot of, I know! Oh? Well, congratulations, so do you love her? Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device. You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans. We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! Surprise! Well, it was all Ross’s idea. Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny. Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi! Care for a cherry? No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue. Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper? Up! Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress. Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him? What? It’s not Christmas! He’s not 11! What? You’re leaving?! No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned! So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. All right. Who wants to go first? Yay! Emily! Okay, my turn! It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again! All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. Just a bug. No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed. Hi! Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’ Gimme an ‘M!’ Gimme an ‘I!’ Gimme an ‘L!’ Gimme a ‘Y!’ What do you get? Emily! Emil, Whoa! Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now? All right, come on, let’s go get your coat. Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y’know, this bra, Really, bothers me. Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control. Ughhhh! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen. Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you. Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them! Why?! You like me? Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me! Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you. Oh, now see that’s a fancy but. But. Okay. Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go. Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself. Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser? I’m so sorry. Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end? You seem to really like her. Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks. Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. Yeah. I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids. Hey. You’re a pathetic loser, right? Sit! Oh my gosh, Joshua! They’re not true? Oh. Oh! Oh, I love that but. You wanna go inside and have some coffee? Okay. Every time. All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy. Give it here. Oh, God. Is that the heartbeat? Oh wow! This is so cool. Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?! What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long. Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua. No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination. Yes! I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs! Hey! Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off? Well, what-what ‘cha got there? Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives. Hey! Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised. Okay. RelaxiTaxi! Well, well I came up with it! Well, I. Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab. Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal. What am I making him by the way? I thought I was making him filet mignon? Wow, I really get crabby when I cook. Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in! Hmmm! Oh I know, my God, this is so, this rice is so, I am so good. Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here sometimes they migrate back over. Yeah, sure, okay. Okay. All gone! So, farm birds, huh? Oh. Okay. So, can I serve you a little of, What? What? What? But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here. Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment. Your parents’? Ohh. Yeah that works. Wow! This place is fabulous! Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet. Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out? That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up? Ah. Hi you! I know, I can do more than cook. Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. Hello. Hello. What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not, that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so. And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, USA not ready. Yes! Well, we were going to do that after, I mean umm, next. Oh, yeah, well, Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house. Yes. Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out. No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. So? Huh. She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on. Absolutely! Absolutely! What, yeah, what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian. HEY! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday! I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy! Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small. Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Hey! So. Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves? Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me. Yeah. Do you guys want these? Ohh, well you got ‘em. Just give us our apartment back! Oh, come on! We know what these are worth. You’re bachelor pad?! Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua. All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets? Let me finish. I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all. Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty. What? Shut up! We’re winning! Okay. All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again. Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high! We took our apartment back! All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer. Let us keep the apartment and. Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back? Yeah. Yeah, II heard. I think it’s great! Ohh, I’m so happy for you! Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes! Oh! It’s you. Hi. Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay. Yeah. Oh, that’s sweet. Uhh, hang in there? I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua? Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically. I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua. You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like, it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes. Oh yeah? Fine. Oh yeah, no, what’s that? That would be great! Hang in there. You hang in there. No, just singing. Hi! Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway! Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s. Why not? Nothing. In a month? You mean, you mean 30 days? From now? Well, that’s great. Hi! Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you. Yeah! Sit! I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why? ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know? Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I, that I think we need, we would need to work on II would think it was we’re just not crazy enough! Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if Grunts uncomprehensively. I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married? Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, Whoa! Can we do this? Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think? Well, I just called Joshua. Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married. I’m just going through a hard time. Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue. Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well. And II am just trying to figure out why. Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again. Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three. Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there. Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me. Well, apparently he scares easy. It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would. Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily? Yeah. Yeah! I got my girls. Ugh. What? Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood. Oh, okay! I’m not gonna marry Chandler! Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo. Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it. Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! Hi, sure! I knew. I did. Yeah, maybe. Really? Oh Ross, you're so great. OK. Ohhh! Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it! All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it! Yes! Did you see that? I could not have done this without you. What? Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship. Good. Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that. Well neither do I! Oh my God. Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard. I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break. No. A break from us. Hi. Ohhh, you got my message. So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again? Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! Just get out! Now! Okay! All right! How was she? Was she good? Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it! How was she? Good different?  the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater.   Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective. You seem to really like her. Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks. Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip. Yeah. Hey guys! What’s up? What’s this?

No, I’ll think about it. Yeah. Who's this from? Oh. Oh my God. He remembered. It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! What did you just say? Oh, my God.  Oh my God. Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?  She didn't hang up either. Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat. I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. Ohhhhh God. Ohh, ohh.

We are so over! And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal! Oh my God. Oh. I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late. Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s, Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour. I know. Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in. So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming? Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us? Hormones! Nooo!

Sorry, things aren't working out so well. Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, I take thee circus freak. Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right? Right! Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame. Get the hell out of there, y'know? Well, look at that, same thing. Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink? Okay. Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe! Hi! Well, Ross said my name. Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then. Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside. Hi! Well, III've been on Standby for a flight home for hours. Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh? So umm, what time are you supposed to leave? Yeah. I'm sorry. No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love. No, you know what, I think you should go. Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good. Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you! Yeah. Good! Right! Right! Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here. What? Wait, what? Well-well, I don't know Ross-really? Uh-huh. Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that! Okay! All right! Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah. Oh, wait-wait-wait! Okay. Wait! Wait!

Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh. Hi! Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do. Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool. Oh no, you're the best. What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying? I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions. Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London. Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me. That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life. Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it. I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it. I mean it's my fault. Oh my God! Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me. Hey! Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night. Well? That's not European! Oh God, I really had a good time! Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside? Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second. Umm, hi! Is Monica around? II have to ask her something. What's that? Oh, honey that's awful. But, it's not raining. Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave! Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now. Yeah. Ohh! You did not drop any socks! Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, II wanted to tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him. Why? Why not?! People love to hear that! Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired. Well. No. Well, then talk! Yes! I'm gonna do it. But I. All right, fine. Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just--y'know--stop it! Phoebe, woo! Yeah, y'know what? I'mI'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute. Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter. Yeah, II don't care. What 'cha readin'? Yeah, what's it about? Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong. Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here. Okay. Umm, okay, I think I'mI'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross. I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious. Because, because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when I said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, You are such an idiot! I'm sorry, that's not funny. Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this? The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily. Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that? That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. High-five, the babies are coming! I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that! You-you're not wearing a jacket. Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming. Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful. Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses. They're male nurses. Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say? What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go. What? Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some JellO with them. Joey, how do you make that dirty? Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice. Yeah! Yeah! Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news! Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies! Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children! Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane. Me?! No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids! No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet. Y'know who I always liked? Mork. Yeah, but umm. Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right? Hi! Monica, this is Dan, one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica. Hi! Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time. Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh? Yeah, fair enough. Oh, how does he look? How does he look? Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls. Yeah, umm, no honey. So does it really hurt as bad as they say? Hi! I just wanna-Ahhh! Oh my God! Oh my God! Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy! That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta? Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him. Why aren't you guys at the movie? So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man? I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had! What-what-what are you gonna do? Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish. Chandler! Is he? Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late! For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes. Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay! Like what? Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help. Well, II know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to. Hi! Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy! Hi, guys! What's going on? Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too? Oh look! A letter from my mom. Oh yeah! I know. Oh my God! My dog died! Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog! Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God. It's Le Poo. Oh yeah! What? Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me? Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either. Hi! Okay, what's up? Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants. Yeah? That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you? Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died! Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you. Storming out! Yeah, well that's how mad I am! Hi! Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right? That's not Ross! Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip. Do you even know who Kip is? See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out! Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go. Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out. Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me! Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones. Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules? Oh, Ross. No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you. Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding! I know. I know that too. Yeah, it's in there. Uh-huh! Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please? I want the little round waffles. Okay, y'know what? I'llI'll have toast! Arghhhh! You guys! You guys! It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something! Yeah, III just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass! Yeah! Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny? Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you. Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something. Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it. Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you. Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry! Really? Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts! What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion! Hi! What? Yeti. I mean Danny? Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so. Y'know. What? What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me! So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know II could have toys for underprivileged kids in here! Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants. And stop saying that! I hate that! Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you? What?! Okay. Okay. Hi! Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny. That yeti is one smooth talker. Yeah, y'know II think I'm just gonna hang out in my room. Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really, I don't mind. Ross, I. Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down. I haven't seen him in so long! Ross, honey, is there anything we can do? Thank you. Mon? How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff. Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced. I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing. Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh? Ohh, great! Yeah. Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out. That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it? No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me? Exactly. Oh, hi Danny. Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy. Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala. It's a uh, regatta gala. No-no, but I support it. Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he? Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, No! Which puts me right back in the driver seat. Ball? There is no ball. Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala. What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?! Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there! No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy. Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party. Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime. Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now? Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place! Oh, go on! You telling people about me? Yeah, okay, at ease solider! No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros! Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, Nice try. Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park! Yeah! Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us. Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for. Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you? I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving. What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?! Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about. No, it wasn't. It was actually the. Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building. Oh hi! No, God! Please, let me! Hey! Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great! What?! Okay, that we may be able to do. Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex. Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are. Yeah. Then, you will definitely get him back! Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on. Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him. Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up? You brought a carrot?! All right! Who's are they? Who's are they? Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you? Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear. Hey, Pheebs! What are you reading? Honey that sounds like fun. Okay. Oh, I read that in high school. Sorry I'm late, but I left late. So Pheebs, what is the book about? Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway umm, what is this book about? Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the moors, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character. Well, honey that was pretty obvious. Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you! Joey, is what she just said umm. Oh my God. You were actually gonna. And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick? Hi! So umm, what's this book about? Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else. Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman. Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie! A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?! Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time. Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that! That was not funny! Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun! Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with? Oh my God! That's Monica! You get away from me! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o! Joey has got a secret peephole! Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them! Look! Well, what is the truth? Monica, is this true? Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? And the video camera? Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is. Thanks, Mon. Monica! Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. I have a date with Danny. I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship! No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan. So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out. You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch! Hi! Uh, it was very nice meeting you. Hey! Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something? Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle? Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway. Yeah, they were very y'know wrestley. But, I guess that's normal? Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. Oh, great! Okay, see? I told you! Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it. Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and. Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's. No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy. No-no, they're not very nice people. Well, uh, II don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of. Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great! Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick! I'm not reading this! What?! So? Oh, good point. Happy New Year, Joey! But your divorce isn't even final yet. Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about. I don't gossip! Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip? What? They were like this! I didn’t! Even when I found out umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. I think they're very nice. Awful, absolutely awful. Baddest man in the whole damn town. Arghh! Joey, do you have a minute? Oh, Joey, I have such a problem! Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something! Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone. Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable! What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they? I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone. That really is something that's really cool. Good luck, honey! Hey, uh, Joey? Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about? I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right? Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me? Yeah! Do you know something? I might know something too. Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know. Well then I can't tell you what I know. All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! AND YOU KNOW! Chandler and Monica?! Oh, this is unbelievable! How long have you known? Ohhh, yeah, me too. Come on Joey! I can't believe you would say that! No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want. I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss? Is he romantic with her? Are they in love? You don't know anything. What? Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that. Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back. Hey! What's up?! Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know II feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you? Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything! Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships! Nothing! You go! Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if are you sure there's just not anything else? No! If there was I wouldn't tell you. Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute. There he is! Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there! You walked around all night in the city by yourself? Yeah! No that's what I was thinking. Ross! Janice?! Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go! Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler. I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours. And he said, Laundry? Is that my new nickname? And you said, No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big. Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone. What?! All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler. Sure! Why? What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now! Hey! Hi! Well, I was actually. II came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better. Yeah! Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money. That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books! Okay. 'Kay. Congratulations on your new job. Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out. Sure! God, please take those off! What? Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now? Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear? Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag. No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag. Exactly! Unisex! No! No Joey! UNI-sex. Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow. Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it. All right, then you owe me 350. Joey! Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy. Hi sweetie! Why?! Why not?! Okay. Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part. Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are? What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it! Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it. I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial. I'd say from the looks of it our naked buddy is moving. Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt. Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man. Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. What?! Oh my God! OH MY GOD! Phoebe! Phoebe! It's okay! It's okay! I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW! Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming! HI! Hi! Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it. Joey! Come here! Come here! Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler. No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window. Wh-what do you mean? Ohhh, II would enjoy that! Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing. You don't have any secrets! So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them? Okay. Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us? Oh. Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks! Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet? Oh. What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment? All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself! Y'know what you should do? You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear. See? Yeah, he broke those too. Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler. Are you kidding?! I can not believe he would do that to Mon. Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know? Joey! Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two! All right. Be sexy. Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross! Show time! Okay! Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here! Okay? Whoa, wait! Yeah, oh wait! Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open. Okay! Hey, what's-what's going on?! Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while. Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react. Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you. Okay. She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket! Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I-Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you? Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that. Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you. And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head. Well, because she loves you and because you love her. Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica. No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different. Not unless different means the same. Hi! Wow! You look, you look big. Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why. Hey! Hey, cute jacket! Oh! Ow! Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya IIII think you are the one who is too much. Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! Ohh, you're so sweet! Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler? Uhh, we still need a tip. A couple of bucks. Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge. Hey Joey! Ugh! What?! You say that to kids?! Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch. Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away! Yeah! Are you kiddin'? Oh. Oh! I can do it! Ross! Ross! Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch. Fine! We went out. Ross! Oh my-ugh! You kept count?! You are such a loser! Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here? Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left! Yeah. Oh-oh! Any chance you think the couch looks good there? Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure? What's up Joey? Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch? Thanks! I know. What's up Joe? Yeah? What are you saying? Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, II don't think we should be cranking anything up. Yeah, well, y'know umm. No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends! Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait. Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements. Well, I brought the next best thing. Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself. Okay! Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit. I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch! Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends? What?! Why?! Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?! Good, you guys are all here! Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow! I know! Wh-what?! Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me! Yeah. O-okay! Hi. Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing! No! Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets! Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh! All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me. Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh. Well, I didn't know what else to do! Thanks Chandler. I can't believe it! I got a second interview! What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back? I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody! Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him? Maybe. II don't know. Oh God, how could I be so stupid?! Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you. Hi! Thank you. What? Excuse me? Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I, hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me! Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that? Oh. Ohhh. Ah, first, II would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again. Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you. Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr. Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it. Oh! You are? Really? Oh thank you! Oh. Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug? Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that. I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so. Hey! I'll see you Monday! I cannot believe Ross is buying this! Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck! Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day. Okay guys, way to wish me luck! Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry. Oh, what a fun office. Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories, about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke. and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me! I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit! I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson? Yeah, I can do that. I would love to! Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air. Oh great! Oh that's okay. Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually. Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here? Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, Wow, those guys are crazy! But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time. Oh, me too. Oh, me too. Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions. Thanks! Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success. I did not! All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career! No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up. I am so on board! Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach. Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit! Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get-what are those-those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters! Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! Okay then! Hey! Hey-hey-hey! Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters! Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about? Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down. Okay. Oh man! What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month! Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine! Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird. Oh, okay, not so weird. I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law amp Order! No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him. What's going on? Ross! We broke up two years ago you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people. Hm-mmm. Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. Big night! Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. Here you go. Thank you! Oh what, you-you want both of them? Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it. Tell her to wear her own earrings. Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff! Because I lose her stuff! Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary! Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh! Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women. But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing. Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me! Ohh! Thank God! Where was it? Okay that is the one we already have! What?! Yeah. Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault. It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelery box? Hey! The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. Okay, calm down, here they are. I don't know, I don't know. Oh gosh, she's going to kill me. Ohh that'd be great! Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, III, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. Your sunglasses?! Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to. I'm sorry. Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza? No. No. Every thing's-they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting. Yeah. I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person. Yeah. I'mI'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you. Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think? Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought. Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. Yeah! III didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute. Yay! Hey! Ohh, thank God! Finally! Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog. Great! Thanks! Okay. Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh? Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita? No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready. Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM? What?! Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes! Ugh, who would buy this?! Hey! What's up?! So all we have is ice? Okay. Oh. Oh! I know! What?! We can't do that! Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message! I don't think he's the one who needs help. Ugh! Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! Nooooo! No, wait. Wait. No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this! Yeah well unless we tell him. Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message. Right? Hey! Hi! Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross? What?! What? What happened?! Yeah! Really?! Because a car backfired? Well, III don't know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um, Emily called you today. No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine. Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right? Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because. I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me not important. The point is, I was right. You're decision. Okay? I was right. You're decision. Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no RossRoss, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that? Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience! Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff. I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily? Well, there you go! Close call day. Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. Oh? No. Yeah. Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right? Hey, you guys. Is Monica here? All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl. Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready? Okay! Check it out! It's a, it's a cat! Yes it is! Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat! Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal. A thousand bucks. All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it! Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?! Hey. Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time. Yeah? Well, it's my cat. Oh yeah, I got a cat. You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, Rachel! Well, I was gonna let you play with it. I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing! I tried! They won't take her back. Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats? No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! It's not a baby! It's a cat! Oh no! No! It's actually it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it? Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on! Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it? Oh, terrific! That'll be 2,000. Okay, a thousand. Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat. Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So 800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody? It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson. Yeah, 15 hundred dollars. Oh yeah, there you go. Oh good, great!

No, I meant with the dropper over here. Well, my eye is a little itchy. Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend! Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor! Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine-Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please? Monica! Come on! Ross! Stop it! Come on! Chandler! Just stop it! Come on! All right!

Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work. Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that. That sounds great. Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night. No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time. No!

What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night. Who got married?! No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous! Oh my God. No! Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? Hey, hubby! Uh-huh. Okay! So, we’ll just stay married. And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller! Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding. What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?! Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me. You are asking me to be your wife! Hey! No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married. Oh b-b-but it is! Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will! Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower? Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the. All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment? Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? Pheebs? Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment? Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie? Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. Oh? Yeah! Sure! Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie. Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica. Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?! What was that?! I haven’t seen it yet! Nooooo! Hey! Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel. I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky! What? Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys! And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together! And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late. Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God! Come and knock on my door. Hey roomie! Are you pregnant?! Um-hmm. Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that. Okay. Sure? Thanks. Monica, where did you get these?! Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! Hey! Okay! Okay. What the hell is that? Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate! Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time. Are you okay? You’re not blinking. Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era. What is the matter with you?! All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe. Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry. But I. It is? Really? I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore? What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! I mean it’s the end of an era! Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing. Thank you. Pheebs, I wanna ask you something. Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful. how about I move in with you? You have a roommate?! Oh, that’s true. Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place. Pheebs, I have to ask you. You’re just staring into space. This one? Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full! Hey. Yeah! Why? That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s! I love Warren! Thank you! Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you! Ugh! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything. What?! Oh my God! Are you serious?! I would love to live with you Ross that’s-that’s great! Thank you! RossRoss, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero! Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! Hey! Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in. No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here! No-no, I’m staying put. Why, where are you going? Hi! Oh wow. Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird? Well, because of us! Because of our history. No? No! Not at all! Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating. Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend. But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky. Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied. No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out. Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy? Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back. All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later. Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s. So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine? And? Look at that! What?! No-no, I bought those. Yeah. Well, who wouldn’t?! And Mrs?! What?! Ohh! Oh God! Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you? Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring? Some uh, some visual aides. Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing? Pheebs, what-what are you doing? Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down? Monica! Did-did you take these back? Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they? Yeah. Nice try! Hey! Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before. Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes. Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches. Yeah, and not a very good one. Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice this time of year. No! They are mine! You stole them from me! Yeah that seems fair. We never use them. Well? Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening! Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you. Really? Really?! Okay! Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you to come on board with us full time! Hey! Really?! How do you know? Oh, I’m sorry. Hello? Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message? Ross got married again? Noooo! Ross! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife! What, were you just never gonna tell me?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Ugh, I could just kill you! I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married! When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn’t get the annulment we are still married. So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now. Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs. Well there’s an idea! That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for? December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause. Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye. Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you! Op! You’re peeping! Ross! Y’know what, I just got, why? Why did you do this?! I don’t wanna hear Three failed marriages! Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry! Ugh! Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. Uh yes, heroin and crack. Well, you would know. Ross, please, I found the magazines! Ugh! Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike Consummated like bunnies from the record? Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think. What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?! All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one! And thank you for your time. This is totally your fault! Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine! Don’t call us that! Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried. Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything! Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you! Nothing. Uh-hmm. Okay Ross, we’re, wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession. Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess. Yeah, don’t push it though. I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this. I’m gonna need a copy of those. Pheebs, I was wondering. Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. Yeah, yeah, I know. Surprise! No, no don’t get mad because look, this is what happened. So II started packing, then I realized, What am I doing? I am lousy at packing! Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da! Ohhh, look it’s the roller blades. You remember when we got these? I guess you weren’t there. I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving. I have one. Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. You get your messages! So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Ooh, your brother. Score! You know what else I’m not gonna miss? I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it! I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever! Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there! I’m unpacking! I’m not moving! Is that picture straight? Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?! Well it’s mine too! What else you got?! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! Great! Monica’s moving! Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! Yeah, I’m just mad! Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving. Oh really? Like what Monica? Oh yeah, good start Mon. Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet. Yeah, I do. II do, do that. Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold. Oh, it’s gonna be fine. But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler. Okay. Oh! I have your key. Here you go. Yeah. Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! Bye house! Bye Mon. Yeah. Hi. Rachel. Phoebe’s. leave. Wait, II just said leave. Phoebe, come on that's silly. No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch. Okay. Everybody. Rachel, Phoebe’s. What? Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?! Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing. Yeah and there's really cute guys there. OK! Now wait a minute. You just took all the words! Okay. You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man. Oh! I used to do that too! Aw, Mon. Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her. You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth. Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever! Ankle. No, no Phoebe no, I was no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can! No, wait Phoebe. Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Okay, um, I. All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you. Well, II should've told you the truth. Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little. Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy. Because they're people. Yes, but still. They're people, with eyes. II am not uptight. Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man. Hey! Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great! Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress? Hey. Yeah. Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore. II, got a job at Ralph Lauren. Yeah. A year ago. But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much. Sure. Oh my God. Did you talk to him? What? What!?! You kissed him? Phoebe are you serious? Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married? Phoebe. Oh, Kim, Hi. So you know, I. I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought. Ahh. So. Wow. The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh? So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year. That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please. What? Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy. Oh. Go. Oh.and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe! To get you to make out with him! Ohh, hi, Kim. Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen. Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true. No. Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him. II don’t want your job. II don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job. I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren. You were with Kenny today, weren’t you? Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do? I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t. That wouldn’t help me. Kim, hi. Okay. Okay. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore. Yeah, he dumped me. He said, Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry. And then I don’t know why but he said, and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine. Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad. You and Ralph? Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle! Nothing? So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert? Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done? Her dancer friends? Really?! I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing. Look at it, isn’t it beautiful? It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top! The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought well, there’s mincemeat pie, I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place? And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste. Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees! No! Yeah? No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic. Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like. Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle? So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright? Okay. What’s up, Ross? Yeah! Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this. I just I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea. I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now. No, II live with Phoebe. I mean you’re alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry. Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert. No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time! It sure is. Beef. Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste. Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers! Op! Wait, you dropped a pea. Well? Really? How good? Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it. So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this? Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you! I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle! You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! II just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad! That’s a good story, Grandpa. So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her! Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing. Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet. We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK? Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas? Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why? That’s right! Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag! Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P. S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you. We are so gonna find them this year. Yeah. Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats. Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing? Ha! Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey! Hey, this is hollow. This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents! Oh, this one’s for me! Ooh, let’s open them! Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine. Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade? ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then! Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself. I know. Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away. Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is? Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?! Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store. Okay fine! I’llI’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs. Hey! Guess! Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table. Ohh, yes. Almost. It was only 500 bucks. Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then. Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar. And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars. Yeah. Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know? Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains. Hey! We’re here! Ohh! Oh my God! Oh no! Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this! I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original. Because she hates Pottery Barn. I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please? Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets! Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you. Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind. Hey! Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie! He got it a flea market! That’s funny. Ohh! Nooo! Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique! Oh yes. see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table. I know, I know. I went a little crazy. Hey. Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times. Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear. Oh honey he doesn’t need my help. Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come. Oh, she does want to. Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time. Yeah. Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. Seriously, don’t look at it. Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go. No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the. We don’t have the that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side. Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just. Come on don’t be mad. Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross. What?! No! I’m not gonna move out! Oh. Yes! I would so move out! That’s right! I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. We are looking at a Playboy. Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’ You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy. I don’t know. Monica, what are you doing? Well, people are different. What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover. Oh my, you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. I cannot believe her. Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place. All right, wherever you wanna go is cool. No. Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there. Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine. Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin. Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second. Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky. So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky? Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover. I am not a pushover! Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard. How-how did you lose your job here? He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right. Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him. No, I really shouldn’t say anything. No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him. What? That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back. Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover? Oh, I’m sorry. Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs. Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick? Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls? Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. Oh my God, Jill! This is Chandler. And you know Monica and Ross! And that’s Phoebe, and that’s Joey. Don’t! Honey, what are you doing here?! Wow! What did he say? Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me. Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off? Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, III at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us? Hey! What’s goin’ on? Jill! Did you shop?! You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible! What’d you get? Oh. Apartment pants? No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get? A Pashmina? Really? Jill? Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that! All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the Pashmina. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. Hey! What’s up?! Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it. What?! With Ross and Jill? With Ross and my sister? With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross? Oh there is no way. Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t. I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me. Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front. That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university. Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out? I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys. Yeah. Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross? Are-are you saying he’s a geek? No! No I, no Ross is not a geek! What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him! Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant. Yeah but, he’s not your type. Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you? She-she died Jill. Hi! Well yeah. Really?! Oh so-so not really never. Hi! Wh-what are you doing here? Well, II don’t like it. It’s kinda slutty. Yeah well, I’mI’m a slut. Rachel. Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not! Why aren’t you home yet?! Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry! Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing? Oh, he brought her back to his apartment. Ugh, she is a slut! Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes! Oh, this is just terrible. Oh. Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago. Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over. Oh don’t even ask! Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are! I’ll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night? Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off? So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumour has it you guys shut the drapes! Oh, slides. So really nothing happened. Right. Was it the, Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe? She asked-asked you out again? Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it. Thank you. I yeah. No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it! It’s just gonna freak me out! Ross thanks. Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy. I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you? Yeah do it now, call right now. Hey! Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources. It’s not random, it’s Bob. No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to. Hm-mmm. Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history. No. Y’know Bob in Human Resources… Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just. I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do! Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have! All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob! In Human Resources! I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?! Do I have my own castle? No. Oh my God! Wow! I mean, I just. I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark. Absolutely not. Probably just the first half. Well it’s hard to tell. Oh God, if she would just stop moving. Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t. Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula! Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere. Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her. What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?! Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me! Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me! Oh! I knew it! What happened? What?! You kissed! Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing! Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that. What?! Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. Yeah, I got that. Bye-bye-e! Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce! Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend. Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me. Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be? Merrill Lynch? Well why didn’t you take the job? Rob Tillman! Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman. Ohh, of course Monica’s brother! Wow! How are you?! Ohh! Me too! Oh, it’s the best! So, umm how’s Monica? Ohh, I would love too. Ohh! Okay! Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?

Umm, can I use your bathroom? Okay. God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment. Yeah, it sure is! Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins? Wow! Tell me something Joey. Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there. Okay. Yeah? Wow!

Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?! No! No-no-no. But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother. Yeah! Ohh! My God! Barry! Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! II am early! Finish! Please! Hi Ross! Is Joey Tribbiani here? Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up! Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!

And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?! No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage? Aw what are you?! A detective? Oh. Who are these men? Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay. Good day for married people huh? I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either. Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya! Yeah! What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya! Isn’t that a kind of sushi? Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now! Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour. Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar! Aw, I love that. Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun. Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock! What the hell was that?! All right, so we weren’t prepared! Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. Yep! Oh, of course! Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick. Say it! Say it! I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over. Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women! I.

Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time. Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles. Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here. Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident. Okay! I have. I did. I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow. What? Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight! Oh. Oh, Joey! Sorry! Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain! Really? I’ve never lived like this before. I love it at Joey’s! Thanks! Hi! Uh-huh. No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here. No! No!

No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! What is the matter with you guys? I. Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for? I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date! I am still talking! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y’know. Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?! Thank you! Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. I wanna say a disease. Huh. All right. Oh-oh Professor Geller. So Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E. Huh. Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac. Hey! You love those! Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor. Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! I'm sorry, what? Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!

But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself! Already? That’s pretty bad what you did. I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works. Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for! What?! You fell asleep?! Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over! And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal! That is the most ridiculous. I did not sell you out. Would you let me talk. OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus Ow. That hurt. Fine! Okay, Chandler! And your horoscope says, On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift. Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat. Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself. Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C. H. E. E. S. E.! Be-because the last one was such a big seller? Hey! We do? Okay. Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up!

I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’ Ohh. So you raised her all on your own? Ohh. Ooh! I was just getting him to like you. Ross, Joey is not here. Ross, it’s okay. You can come out. Bye! Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them. No! Downstairs!

Why?! Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer! Oh it’s important! So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me. Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom. Oh we were, but that was just a, I mean that was just a big drunken mistake. Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily! I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage. Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. Maybe I have to pee again. Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is! Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too! What’s the matter? So what-what is the exhibit. Hi! I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils. Umm. Yeah. Ooh, the gift shop! Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned. What?! No! Why?! I didn’t know you could get married here. Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space do you do a lot of weddings here? Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list. Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it. I’m gonna do it too! Really? Who would, who would you marry? Oh Pheebs. Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house. It’s so secluded up here. I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry. No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside!

Okay, II’ll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car. Surprise me. So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be! Oh wait-wait-wait! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda! Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here? Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings. So what are you saying I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table? Hi! Okay. Okay. Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day. Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now? Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what. Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours. No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood! Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag. Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm. The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets? All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything! Okay. All right. Hm-mmm. That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. Oh! Yeah. Yeah, III see the scare.

I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid 100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? 2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking! Oh, I’m sorry. I. II don’t mean. I didn’t mean to stifle you. I. This is all just a little overwhelming. I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm. Ugh! No more crying! Please!

You’ve got the wind in your h, arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can, ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy. What?! What?! But Joey you don’t have 20,000! Hey! Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand! Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married. Ohh. I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen? No! I’m so happy for them! I’m so happy and not at all jealous. I mean I’m probably 98 happy, maybe 2 jealous. And I mean what’s 2? That’s nothing. Yeah me too. Wh, no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille. We’re gonna find love! Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80 happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though. Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other. Exactly! You do? Who? Joey?! Are you serious?! Wh. So. If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey. Oh, seriously? Charming. Yeah. Hey you! Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it? So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, What’s that?! Exactly. What? Who? Phoebe?! Wait a but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup. Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal! Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups! What?! Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one! Oh God, Phoebe! Oh. Okay, y’know what?! I knowI know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay? Pick one. You’re welcome. Joey! We should just switch. Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been! Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about! Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to. Yeah, you’re on your own. Okay. Hey! Oh, thanks. I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm. No, y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine. Hi! Well thank you, you too. Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married? Ohh. Yeah, I guess. II. I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that? Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone. Shake it off. No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm. Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing. Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff. Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night! Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night. Yeah-yeah, we never had that, What? Oh honey, but it is just about. What?! Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw! Honey I swear it we just kissed. Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on! No! No-no, it’s really not huge. Joey, you are not! You’re 31. Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look. Hey. What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing. Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you! I care! Y’know what, II have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed? Am I going to let you watch me undress? Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me? No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about? What?! Monica, what are you talking about? Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring! Oh! Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago. Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder! All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen! I swear, I never wanted any part of your night! Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night? Oh wow. That y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex! We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it. Who is it? Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you? All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?! No you don’t know why! Because! Because I was sad. Look, I am so so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler! Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night. Yeah. Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans! Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music. Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks. Okay. Aw. What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?! Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall! What?! Now Joey, what did the duck do?! Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing? No. Joey, did you eat my face cream? Joey, where did you learn that word? You found my book?! Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?! Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. Well what happened at dinner? Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown you can wear off the rack. Do you even understand what off the rack means?! Well what?! How-how much is it?! Ohh! Really?! Ohh, you guys are so made for each other. Joey. Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha. Well no, I don’t smell anything. Nothing! Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey! Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. Who are you supposed to be? Do you even know what a vicar is? Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s. I’m not it’s just not funny anymore! All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it! That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things. Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body! Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey sex me up! Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! Yeah, what? Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm. Yes! Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players. Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey. Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want. Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat. What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. That is the Coast Guard. Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet. Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready? Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what’s this called? Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up? No. What do you do if I say we are coming about? Time’s up, now your dead. Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?! Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time. I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything. Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey? Why not? What? I was just trying to teach you. Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets. Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher. Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson? Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom! All right, y’know what? II’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling. I won’t boss you around. And, I’ll be nice. And. Joey! Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side? Right? It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one. Okay, go to the left. The left! Just sit over there! No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling. Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? Joey, come on! We just went over this! No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do! What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit! Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit! Oh my God, wait did I. I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? Did I just say Greens don’t quit?! No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn. Really? Awww. Left. Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun. Ohh we’re not sailing. All right. Hey-hey-hey! Sandwiches! Here you go. Oh wow! Ohh, sorry. Ohh whoops. That’s nice. Well that was umm. Okay. Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine! What are you gonna do Pheebs? Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and. Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here! Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in. Joey! Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office! It’s the same story. Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail. Yeah! I got. I get a big pay raise! I get to hire my own assistant! And you were at this job for four years? Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay? I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing. No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you. All right. I’m a total pro! Wow! H-umm! Hi!

G. I. Friday’s, come on! Okay, hold on just a second. I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please? Chandler, you have an assistant right? No, II just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy. I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do. Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty! Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda! Hi! Tag. What are you doing here? Kinda. Oh-ohh, thank you. Well. But I hired you! Yeah!

Hey, I thought that guy was married. Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him? Oh, I gotta get back to work. Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker. Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife. I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it. Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing! Oh, no sit-ups today Tag? Oh, well drop and give me ten more! Uh, II had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in? Oh, great could you make me four copies of those? Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s up? I’m just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? No. Why? Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya? Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight. Oh yeah. All right, back to work. Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor. Hi Joey! What are you doing here? Yeah, sure. Umm here. Yeah, I don’t think so Joe. Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight? How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay. I’m not asking you to go on a date with him! Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it. Yeah? Yeah! Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? Ohh that’s nice. Wo-women? You mean like old women? Oh. That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh? Yeah? Hi! So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night. Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey. Y’know, all the women. All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just. And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him but it just bothers me, all right?! All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is! I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush. And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But. I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya! Yeah. Sure. So, will you talk to him? Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts. Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night?

Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla! Who is it?! Hypothetically! Uh-hmm. Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea. Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing, my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that. Fine! Yeah? Really?! Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just. Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s. Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s! Why does it matter so much to you?! What-what if I marry Ross. Or Joey? Yeah but Phoebe. Okay. Okay. It’s since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor. I’m gonna marry someone good y’know. Better than Chandler. Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor! You have been maid of honor before?! All right that’s it! I am maid of honor! How come you are?! Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?! Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie. Okay, uh. it’s gonna be okay! Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts. Thanks! Thank you judges. Oh! Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony! Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre. Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as. Okay! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh. I met, II met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old. Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey. Aw, thanks! What?! Well then I demand a recount! No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous. We’re gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads! Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! Hi Pheebs. Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby. Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours. Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case. Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there. And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. I’m just gonna grab a couple of these. Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. Yeah. You do? Why? But Pheebs, y’know you earned it. No, I was ten. I just developed early. Hey! Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. Hi! Oh, how was your date last night? Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry! What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?! Why?! What?! Are you kidding?! Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig? Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility. Hi. Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in. Hi. Would you like some pancakes? Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time! I know! Oh and I’ll call ya too! Bye! Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I. Cupid. Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch. Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere. Fine. Phoebe! I’m sorry? Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good? Yeah, there was. It was there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read. Yes, there was. Well now what’s the rush? Well look who’s here! Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no! Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to. Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?! How did it go with Erin? Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don’t get married before I do. So how’s it goin’ with Joey? Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him. But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?! Ugh, tramp! Yeah, see ya. Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here. Hi! JoJoey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship. Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner. Joey! Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship. Well that too. Joey? Do you want some pancakes? All right, I got 48. How come we have one extra place setting? Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her. Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know, you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. Seriously, it's moving! Hi Tag! What are you doing here? Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend? Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question? When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? Interesting. Huh. A moo-point? Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense? You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do. Hey! How are you holding up? Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend. So were you guys together a long time? Now that she broke up with you? Yeah. Hmmmm. No. Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it it has to work out. Because, uh it has to. Yeah, I know, I do. I really do. Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! Uh, yeah, well, see, he. Joey knows, that I'mI'm very insecure about my back and, and you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah! No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you. Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. What? Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay. Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you I am attracted to you. Gee, II know that I freaked him out. Hi! Hi! Oh, hi! How are you doing? Oh. Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace. Ah, II never should have said what I said. It y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay? Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out. Really? Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday. Gooood morning! Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job! Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem. We. We are not, going to let it be a problem. Well y’know, we did other stuff too. Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date! Anymore! Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct? Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation. Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up? So did you read your evaluation yet? Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you! I’m thinkin’ no. Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie. Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision, and under Problems with Performance I wrote, Dear God, I hope not, and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch. Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it. Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back! Yeah? Oh my God! Joey! Ugh! Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk. Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office. Let’s roll! Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything, minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan. Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly. Well. Oh no-no-no. You’re lookin’ at it upside down y’know what? It doesn’t matter. Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet. No, you could’ve lost your job. Thank you! You’re great! What? I. It just it took me so long to get that desk organized. There it is. Oh my god! You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe. Did you know he was in there? Hey! Drums? Ha! Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air. What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool? Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula. What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter? And that makes you angry because. Where did you get that? Phoebe? Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out! It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates that's the deal. Oh, it's so much more fun with you. We did! Oh, I would love to! Good, good, good, good, good. Um. Done! Oh wow! Look at this place! Oh my God! Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms? And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down? Do you really not know where I’m going with this? It left! It’s one huge room! See? You can’t, because of the new skylight! So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place? Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we? Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone? Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey. Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you. I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair? Hey! Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here. Oh. I got it! Its back in cage! Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby! Hi. Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I. Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief. Why, why not? Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong. Oh, I’m sorry what? Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong? Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy. Big Daddy? Hi! So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem? Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more? It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling. Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva! Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted. Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid! Its still there! She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months. No that could kill her. No so we’re protecting her. But we should move quick. Because I think I just heard her moving around in there. Oh my God! That is so good! Hey! Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some? Mm-mmm. Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law! What?! What?! Wait a minute! Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t! You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half! What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy. Okay! All right, pick a half. Oh for God sake just pick a piece! That’s also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh! Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece. Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it! Hey, come on now! No. No, you can’t. Oh I don’tI don’t know. Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie. Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone. Oh. You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable. Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan? No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them? Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get. Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today! Yes I did! And I put a little PostIt on it that said, Must go out today, and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy. Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk. Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch! No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office. Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work! Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got. Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever. Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a PostIt on it that said, Must go out today. So you just keep looking in there! All right? Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there? I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please. Thank you. Hello? I still don’t get it. Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh, fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me? Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers! Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it’s not in there! How about that drawer? Y’know, I don’tI don’t know. Let me, let me check. Can I see you in my office for a minute? You put these on my desk! Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! I am so hot for you right now. Hey. Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here. So that there will be a decent place for me to sit. And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this. No? I’m sorry, Rosita? As in. Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal? Stevie the TV? No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch! Joey, Joey I am so sorry. Okay, come on. Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair. But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put. your comfort first. Okay? You ready? You will like it! You don’t even know! Well look, if you don’t like this. Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette. Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process? That’s weird. It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation. Joey, I really don’t. Well no. No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something! That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself! Hey, how’s how’s the uh, miracle chair? Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest! Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio! Hey Chandler! How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest? Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment? I just purchased the LaZBoy E-cliner 3000. Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair. Yeah. Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed! Noo! Angels. What? Wh-hey! Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs! No Joe, no miracle. Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back! No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere. The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half! We’re the Cobras! Ahhhh! Uh-huh. Hey! Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it. Good ones? Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29? Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam. Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this? Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty. There you go! Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty! Nothing. I don’t want to do anything. Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again. Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something. So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch! Get out, get out of my apartment. Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming! What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed! Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey. Ahh! A scooter! No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That’s funny, yeah! No, I know! I get it! It’s funny! No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids. Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids. As I was saying. I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan! So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant. No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years. Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty. No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry! I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk. Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs. Ross, I really don’t think… Hey Joey, can I… Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag. Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother. Not in the street! Hi. Hey. Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk. Umm… Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’tI don’t… Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun. Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25! Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger. Yeah, I’m sorry. Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year? Ohh. Yeah, it’s just y’know. Oh! I would love to read a poem. It’ll be a short one. Ohhh. Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain? She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage. Oh! Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress. Well, I'd have to say gay. Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy. Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight. All right, straight, and not subtle. Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found. What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. What? Wait! Why why do you get the story? Phoebe, you had a date three days ago. Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone. Yeah! And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again. Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone? Well umm, maybe we could uhh. Ah-ha! Too slow! No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone. I don’t think so. All right, first name on the speed dial is mom. Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. Yes okay. Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! That’s a steak house! Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial. His new girlfriend! Hi Pheebs! How are ya? Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone? And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up? And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! You stole the phone! No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring? Phoebe! Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It’s for me! Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It’s Rach. Would you stop doing that?! Phoebe! You can’t do th. You do know that I will be here when he comes over. You just said it! Oh Phoebe! Ohh! Hey! Hey! Well why shouldn’t I?! Well, then I get to give him the cell phone. You’re not the man who left the cell phone. Is-is he coming? We’ll be right back sir. I don’t know! I know! What?! No-no they do but, you just have to wait. All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me you owe me big! Ohh. Hi. Oh my God! Oh my God! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan! MONICA! MONICA! God. You seem really, really nice. I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people. Okay. You are so beautiful. I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks. No! Hi! Hi Ben! Oh, yeah go ahead. No. No. Ben, it's Rachel! But whatever. Awww, just like his daddy. What-what about Monica? So it would just be me alone? Huh umm… Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him? Okay. Yeah I think so. Bye. Ahhh… So this is fun, huh? Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink? Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke? Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? Water it is. Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend. No, I’m not. Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay? Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff. Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other. Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal. Yeah? You like that one? I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face. Yeah, IIII’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay? Coming. Uh-oh. Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… Oh that. Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?! Yes. Hi! Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben? Okay. I’d love that. I would loooove… So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little. I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay? Yes oh——Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday? Don’t do that. Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks. Oh damnit! No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that! No don’t! Go back to repeating! Oh crap! So now what have we agreed? And-and what else? Very good. I’m just visiting my good friend Carol. Yeah! Carol…Lesbian? What line? All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already! Okay, maybe they are not funny to you… Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?! That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, I will be revenged?! Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want! Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway! I gotta go! Hey! Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben? Ohh, okay. Wh—Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it. I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. You’ve got something here on your back. Oh I… No! Wait! Come on! No you guys… EHHHHHHHHHHH! My God! Oh my God! Oh my God! You look so beautiful! I do the same thing. I’m just kidding too. I’m getting married in December. Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced. So, does this come in another color or… So this is Brooklyn. Okay. Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing! Well I… No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy! No! You gotta hold my hand! Hey… You’re out of Diet Coke. You’re out of toilet paper! Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced. Well, what is the other reason? Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid. Oh my God! Oh my God! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is! Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that! Will all the stars be there? Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous! No! You are getting married! This is all I have. I’m fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award! What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle. Yeah. Grammy, Best New Artist. Ohh that’s great! So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win. Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation. Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably start practicing your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed, but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… Y’know? Oh no, at the Grammies I always win. Whoa what? Really? Not right now. Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love. Yeah. I didn’t. I got under him. I know! My God! Do you have your speech? Do you got your gracious loser face? Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me! On TV?! Yeah! Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?! Oh my God, you stole her award! Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means. Joey, you have got to take this back! No! Joey! Do you really want an award you didn’t win? Joey, it says Best Supporting Actress! Joey, no: this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real, and that one is gonna mean something. All right? Thank you. Thank you. I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley! Okay, I’m totally cool! Hey Jess. ‘Sup? Absolutely. I’ll be out in a second. Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00. Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go. Hi! Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second? Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least! Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?! She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday… Yesterday! Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it! Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right. Phoebe, I already, I already did. Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it? 4 o’clock. Food? Ooh great! Very Monica. Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons? We’re paying for this y’know. Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme? What? Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list. Hey! What’s up Mon? Have at it. Are you makin’ him a sandwich? We have to get her a present?! Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse? Yeah? Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice. Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica? Ohhhh! That’s great! Excuse us for a minute. You didn’t tell her to come?! No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was supposed to bring the cake! Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake! Oh Monica, we are so sorry. Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either. Ugh… What do you, what do you mean? Surprise… …Monica. Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next? Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this. Melissa! Wh——Why don’t I tell you over here? Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! II actually work at Ralph Lauren! I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear! Oh please… No. Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um… Shut up. Oh, wow thanks! Oh you’re in real estate! Wow! What do you do now? Okay! Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college. She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close. Yes. It’s not a big deal! No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit. Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren’t for playing are they? Hey! Stop picturing it! That is not a problem. Oh, get out of here! So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me! Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back. Some of them. Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!? Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw. This one is uh Paul O’Neil. He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan! Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. It’s a pretty cool tux. Hey! So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one? Well, what are you going to wear? Huh. Does Monica know about this? Can I please be there when you tell her? Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl. Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version? Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit. It-it did! Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?! I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened! Vanilla?! I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I gotI got drunk and married in Vegas! All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you. Oh. Oh, that’s great! Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out. Remember?! We—come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops… …we went back to the house and we got really silly and we…we made out. How can you not remember us kissing?! Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together? Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me. No! Thank you Phoebe. It happened! I am telling you it happened! What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! What? Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! IIII’m just…I’m just a good kisser! I’m sorry! Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna… What the hell was that?! And? Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome! Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome. I don’t want to say. Diane Keaton. Monica what? What is the emergency?! Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress. Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, Chandler, even though we were friends there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more. Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. Hey! Hey, what have you guys been up to? I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years. I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us. Arghh! What?! Oh my God! OH MY GOD! Phoebe! Phoebe! It's okay! It's okay! I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW! Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming! HI! Hi! Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment! All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. Are you kidding?! I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know? Joey! Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two! Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open. Okay! You really think it would be that different? Well, things change. Hey, who's this little naked guy? Aww, look at the little thing. Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is. Oh, can we read them? Okay. Monica, will-will you marry me? Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it. You let Joey drive it?! Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me. Take the top down did ya? Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver! Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader. I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross. Gimme the keys! Well no brush! Alimony. Ahhh! Ooh, nice! My God! Just washing the windshield. Oh. Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car! All right. What are you doing?! Get in the front! Oh my… God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed. Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around. Uh-oh. Really? You think so? Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over! Oh come on Ross! Hi officer, was I going a little too fast? Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest. Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome. Oops sorry, my mistake. Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed. Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there. Yeah. I bet you’re a Gemini. Taurus? Virgo? Sagittarius? I knew it! I knew it, ahh…. Yeah? I won’t speed. I promise. Yeah! Oh well… Remind me to introduce you to someone! Fourth gear! Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position. It’s a different guy! Oh my God! You have a son! Op! We gotta go! Whatcha doing Mon? Hey! Those are all the things Im responsible for! The commercial? Oh thats great! Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I. Youre gonna be late! Go! Go! Mexico? Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful! Yeah! But I dont know what he looks like! Man in the black dress Hi! Im Rachel! Im a friend of Monica and Chandlers! Oh I get it! Amanduh! Ill do it. I said Ill do it! Monica! Im not gonna screw it up! Well of course that is what Im here for! Ugh! What grandmother? Hi! Shes steaming her dress, why? Whats up? What?! Tell Monica Im sorry. Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk. Okay. Phoebe, II think Ross is right. What are we gonna do? Okay. Ross said theres still no word from Chandler. Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue. God! DontWe cant let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait shell be in the gown and then he wont show up and then shes gonna have to take off the gown. Im sorry. Im sorry. Its justIts just so sad! I know. I know. Oh God. Theres no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper? Oh! Okay. Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one? Oh God I just cannot imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesnt show up! Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, Oh that poor girl. Yknow? Then shell have to come back here and live all alone. What? Oh my God! Oh my God! No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night. Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this. Okay? No. Why? Anything? All right, weve got to tell her hes gone. Ross, shes gonna start getting ready soon! All right, well how much time do you need? One hour. Then why do you ask?! All right, Ill see you guys later. Ill figure something out. Thanks. Okay uh, but before you do that. II, I need you to talk to me. Umm Im never gonna getting married! No Monica! Im serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something. Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey. The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And thats every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again. I know. At dusk. Thats such a hard time for me. Okay. But wait! Lets go to lunch. Right. Oh good God! Ive fallen down! Okay. Alright. Honey listen. When I tell you what Im about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you. We cant find Chandlers vest. We cant find Chandlers vest. Oh! You look so beautiful. Hello? Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine. What? Why? Where are you? Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour! Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister. Ugh! Joey, I have to go. Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, yknow. I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time. So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on. Okay. Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding, excellent! Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that? Yeah! Yeah. Theyretheyre-theyre my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus. As are you. Go on! Go on. Uh-huh. Oh my God, who is it?! For you. Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet. You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you. Oh yeah. Oh! Oh by the way? James Brolin? Ed Begley Jr. is not gay. No. No! Thank you. Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else. Phoebe! Okay. Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him. Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now? Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding? Yeah. Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through! I don’t know! Maybe they have tools. Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave. Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well. I don’t know. Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe poor knocked up Phoebe. Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it. I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. Somebody just take this away from me! What?! How many ways are there to do that? All right, I’llI’ll take it again when I get home. Okay. Thank you. Oh, you guys are so great. Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick. How much longer? 30 seconds, okay. Oh I know. I know. Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me. Okay. What? Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God. Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative? What?! Are you sure? Oh! Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game! Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! Ah, it’s still not the time. Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. DoMeALittle! Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left. Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end. Hi. Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they? Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today. Ew! No! Well then you have his baby. Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news. Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything. Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant? Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant! Not yet. No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther. Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now! I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam! No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is! I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father. What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is? Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now? Uh, let’s rip! Oh Phoebe! Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare? Oh, it’s just not the right time. Okay. Tag… I’m having a baby. You can go. Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now? Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra! No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight. I’m not? What? No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband. Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. Oh good you’re still here! I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What? How?! How do you know? Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know. I know! You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles. Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross! Well I was gonna tell him that I’mI’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants. Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks. Hi! Hi. Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about. You do? Okay. What? Seriously. What?! Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now? I’m pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you’re ready. And you’re the father by the way—but you got that… Can I get you some water? Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97 of the time. They do! Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms. Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out… Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later. Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… Okay. If I said I was, would you judge me? Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn… Hi! Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here. Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head? Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross! What married? What, because that’s your answer to everything? Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we? Excuse me? What?! I can too eat by myself! When certain people leave the table and I am not finished! Oh please, you inhale your food! Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father. I do need you! I need you to stand near my head! Wow. There it is, I see it. Okay. I don’t see it! I can’t see it! I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby! Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now. No, I don’t see it! Yeah. That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you. Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby. Hi. Oh, everything went great. Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… Ross, I lost it again. Hi! Welcome home. Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture! Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey. And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me. What is? That-that you came on to me? But you did! I mean, let’s be honest. You know you kissed me first. I was sending you signals? Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now? No please, show me how I begged you! Oh Ross! Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? Hey! Is Ross still here? Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village. Thank you. What? You don’t want to see this do you? I am not gonna show you this! I wanna see it. Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see? Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. Ah, a little preview! Okay, here we go. Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself? There I am. I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and II… II know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today. Kinda hurtin’ my hand though. I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel! Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh… Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged. Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it? Oh I wanted to. Interesting. Oh yeah, sure. Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me. Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe? Okay, get ready to see some beggin’! What?! What are you talking about?! How do you know about that story?! I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy! No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams. So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story? It was an amazing night. You think it looked amazing? Yeah, me neither. Yet… Yeah, it would be really weird. Good luck to you. Oh please. You are undressing very quickly. That’s what I was gonna say. Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend. Have you been working out? Really? Wow, this is so much better than I… Oh! Oh! Oh God! Oh, make it stop! Make it stop! Have to make it stop! Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?! You don’t know do you? Oh! Hi. Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm. Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash. Say hi to Wally. Hi! I thought I was a complete idiot. Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say? What?! Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant? Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay? Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all! Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon, or I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk? Hi! Oh no, I can’t. I got a date. Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you? Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash! Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later. Thank you. Hi! Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think? I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant. Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want. He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch. Doesn’t he? Yes. Okay. Chandler M. Bing? Oh my God. Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard. Thanks sweetie. Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars. Oh you did, there are twenty in here. Good night. Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur. Hi! I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it. Ahh! Okay. Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant II have the strongest maternal instincts. Just a minute! Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. And you are a very funny clown. And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but… Yeah. Sure. Oh, you did this to him? Oh! Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen. Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy. Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy. Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy? Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything. Hey. Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check? Okay, what’s your name? Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash. Hey Mona! Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet. Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world. Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go! Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy. Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween! Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff? You shut up! Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up! Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up! No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying. No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children! Really? You think that’s all it is? Wow! What did he do? I cant. Im busy. Im apartment hunting. Yeah, I cant live with Joey once the baby comes. I dont want my childs first words to be, How you doin? Well, I havent discussed it with him yet, but I know hes gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book. Not so much. Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view? Yeah that would really be great. Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldnt. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect. Shall we? And Im Rachel, an admirer of the building. Ahh. So shes really not dead. Hmm. Do you thinkCould you tell me if shes hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two? Hey! How was the game? Oh. Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go. Oh but Joey, I have to go. Theres no room for a baby here. Honey, its not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when theres a screaming baby around. Honey, its so sweet that you want me to stay, but II cant do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life. I know. I do too a little bit. Hi! You gave them to me! All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch. What bra? You mean the one that youre wearing? What is this? Youre so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! But Joey the baby is going to be crying, its going to be loud. Its gonna be up all night! Its gonna poop! What about all the women you want to bring home? Joey, are you sure? I want me to stay too. Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute! Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition. Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers? Its moving. Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here! Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here. Hey Pheebs? Im having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come? Oh no, no, Ill be there too. No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I havent told him Im pregnant yet. Cause I know hes gonna flip out and I hate it when hes angry. What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again hed make me eat the entire pack. Thank you. No you dont. Well you couldve untied it with your hands. Well actually umm. In case you didnt notice, that is a scary man. This was such a huge mistake. I cant tell him Phoebe. I cant, I cant, I cant, I cant. No its okay, this is whats gonna happen. Im gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him. Hey, that is thebabys problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter? Well Umm, I got TiVo. Phoebe! Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah. No, its Ross. Its Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope youre okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. Youre gonnaThis is your first grandchild! Youre gonna be a poppy! Yeah. Who? February 2nd! I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour. All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong. Yeah? Really?! The Plaza?! Oh daddy! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down. Theres not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married. Im sorry daddy. Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please. Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods. Oh no. Ross Im so sorry. Okay. II will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail. Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address? All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. IllIllIllIll talk to her. Okay. I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that. Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together. Oh we justwe drove each other crazy! I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go! Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now. Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. Hes a good kisser isnt he? Im going! About an hour ago. Yes! Bye daddy. Oh myGod! Let me see that! Hi! Oh Pheebs thats so sweetOoh, those are so cute! No. Wow! I dont remember him. Honey, are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend. Oh thats nice. Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken? Hi! Oh my God Monica, who is that? Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, hes Look at the way hes just staring at me. I think hes trying to mouth something to me, but I cant make it out. Hi! Will, right? Hi! Im Rachel Green. Really?! Arent you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis graduation party? Thank you! All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will? What? Oh yknow what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck! Im sorry. What? Umm, Im sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me? ImImI had no idea. Im sorry. I. Uh Will umm, I just want to say that Im real sorry for whatever II did to you in high school. You had a club?! Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club? So you were in an I Hate Rachel club? So who else was in this club? So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club. Okay Monica, did you know about this?! Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me? What rumor? Ross! What?! Oh my God! What?! You heard that?! Oh no! Oh my God! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldnt go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! Monica, how come you never told me this?! Joey stop staring! Theres nothing there! Its not true! Oh! Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, Dear Rach, youre such a good person. Not girl! Person! Dear Rach, youre a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie. Yes! I dont care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Yknow what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school. What? Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog! Ohh, theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually. WhPhoebe! All right, yknowFine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! Wow. Shes right. You can keep those pants by the way. Hi! Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing! Return them?! Shh! Theyre gonna hear you! Hes talking to the baby. Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later. Bye. Hi. No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste. I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors. Really?! Oh my God! Im successful! Yes! Id love to! Have her come by the office. Yeah. Hi Monica! Hi boots. Ahh. Well-well you can give them to me! I havent felt my feet in years! Oh Joey, Im hardly a. Right! Hi Dina! Nice to meet you. Okay. All right Dina, well lets talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Lets see, theres design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, theres-theres sales, which is great because you get to travel. And theres marketing. Honey, its going to be okay. Hes been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset thats what the meatball sub is for. Okay. Honey, why dont you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you. Joeytheres something that youshould know. Dina? Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! What?! Dina. I know. What college was that Dina? Joey, what are you doing? Oh Joey this is crazy! All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, its not legal. Okay? They-they dont have a marriage license, they dont have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe! Youre supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions. Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right? Oh, come on kids! A little help here! Joey, just because theyre not getting married doesnt mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan! Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why dont you tell us a little bit about your band? Really? Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life? So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen? Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment. No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?! Phoebe? Look at that guy by the window, wow! Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack. Yeah. Really?! So this has happened to you? Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap. Ah. Well, yknow what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, Ill ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something. Hi! Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Yknow who Im talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers. Yes, you are. Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do? Right! Right! II actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend? Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?! No. Im very comfortable. No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?! Well would you like me to lie down on the table? Do you feel it too? Hi. Well, lets see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple. Okay, even this is turning me on! Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey hows it, hows it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together? Uh Ross? You asked me that. I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater. You gave her a key to your apartment?! Hey! Yeah. What? Phoebe no! No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy! Yes. Hi, Id like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie amp Fitch. Ill call you back. Its just the pizza place. Im sorry honey, Im just having a, having a rough day. Oh you really, you really just dont want to hear about it. Okay, its justand this is really embarrassingbut lately with this whole pregnancy thing Im just finding myselfhow do I put this umm, erotically charged. Yeah. So yknow, I have all of these feelings and I dont know what to do about them, because I cant date like a normal person, which is fine because I dont need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, yknow? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what hes doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really sohardto find. So how was your day? Well, I gotta get up early and its almost seven oclock. Okay, good night! I didnt ask you to do it! Youre Joey! Right back at ya! And so bad. I dont even know what youre talking about because I didnt ask you to do anything! No! Thats the end of this conversation! Never happened! Good night! They made you head of the department! Yeah. Uh, Pauls Café. They got great food and its really romantic. Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancingOh! Take her dancing! Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun. Huh? What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady. Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya. All right? Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room? Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you. Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like Im going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere. Yeah, actually thats my roommates. Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself. Hm-mmm. Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay. Now the filet mignon, what comes with that? Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster? Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good dateOh, I almost forgot. I didnt pay you the rent check. Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves? I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves. Oh my God. And that works?! Oh, you poor little famous man. Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did! Alright. So whered you grow up? Come on, just answer the question! And so were-were you close to your parents? Why not? Oh. Its gotta be rough. Huh? Thank you! And now if youll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room. And now youre watching me walk away. I am not gonna answer that! No one! They are my friends, I wouldnt punch any of them. Yeah, but I dont know why. Look at me, Im having such a wonderful time! I know! Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose. Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before. All right, now dont judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. Im ripping into this swan. So tell me, what are Joey Tribbianis end of the night moves? How do you do that? Oh my God! No, I dont want to tell you. Because its embarrassing. Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when were at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, Hmmm. Okay, I know it doesnt sound like anything, but I swear it works. All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time. you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?! Well, why didnt you just take a cab? Well youre not gonna be able to keep doing this. You what? Right. Wow! Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo? Relax! Its not like its Citizen Kane! Yeah I know its really boring, but its like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime. Well dont you have that big date tonight? Hey Joey, can I ask you something? After our date last night, did you feel a little weird? I dont know! ImIm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster. Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night. Really?! How come we didnt cross paths? Oh God! Thank God youre home! Im watching Cujo. Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?! No! No! Seriously, whats wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date? Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me? Yknow, I never thought Id say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me. Okay. Okay, thats him! Thats him! Thats Cujo! Thats Cujo! Oh my God. Whats he gonna do now? I cant watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Arent you scared? Hi, sweetie. Hi! Oh, Ross, dont forget, we have that doctors appointment tomorrow! Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute! Popular. Oh yeah! Ive come up with a bunch of ideas! Really?! Okay! I was thinking if its a girl, how about Sandrine? Its French. Okay fine, what do you have? Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard. Im really, really not. All right. Yeah! I dont think youre going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If its a girl, Rain. Why? Ross, why do you hate our child? Okay, James. But only if its a girl. Oh! Im sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton? Veto. Sawyer? Veto. Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles! But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether its a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo? Right. Right. So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest? Third one from the left? What?! I didnt! Okay fine, I did. But I didnt see anything, I swear. Okay, but Ross just listen to me. But I couldnt even if I wanted to, because I dont know! I swear I didnt see anything, and I dont want to know! It was just a momentary lapse. Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross. Hey. You know what? Ive been thinking about it. Im really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that. I didnt see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name. I wouldSequoia? Fine. But Ross, you want the name Ruth! What? Ross, I swear, I dont know. A what?! Were having a girl? Thats what you just said! You said girl! Im not! Were having a girl! Sometimes I cant believe its with youBut still! Were having a girl! Oh, yes! Well have ourselves a little baby Ruth. Yes, please. Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my! No, I was waiting for you! Were having a girl. Hi, sweetie. Oh Joey, Im so happy things worked out for us that were having this baby together. I love you so much. And I hope its not an inappropriate time to say this but, youre the best sex I ever had. Joey! Joey! Come feel this! Come feel my belly! Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?! Yes! Oh, okay! Aw, its unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player? Mia Hamm! Oh-oh! One hand on the sheet Joe! Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again. Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping. Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I dontWhoa! Really? Okay. Oh GodOw!Oo! Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it youve had one of these Braxton thingies? Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm. But wait you said everything was gonna be okay. But IBut everything is okay. Im fine! Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctors uterus though. Mild discomfort, whats he talking about? Yeah, everythings fine! Okay, no uterus, no opinion. Oh you went to the movies by yourself? Oh, I gotta go back in there. No, everythings fine. I just gotta go back. II forgot my underwear. Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick! Ohh! Thats so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this? Oh Ross! Yeah, Ill be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there? Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna. Whats up? Are you breaking up with us? Yeah? Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here? But Joey, I dont think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I meanOr he does. But Ross, its you and me! I dont know. Is it crazy? Okay, lets do it. Ill move in. Yeah. Hi! Hey, Happy Valentines Day! Its good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. Ill see you guys later. Hi. I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this? Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but Ive got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously cant stop it. Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy! Ross, we actually watched the documentary together. Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! Oh, hey, Mona! Ill be watching TV if anybody needs me. Im not here! Thats just my Chinese food! You know what Im going to do? Im going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! Im just going to grab the phone. Oh, Im sorry! Do you need the phone? But, but, Mona, I live here. Hi! Im so sorry to barge in on your Valentines, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross. Why? You saw it? Is it scary? Well, now, wait. Now Im all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me. Cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone! Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?! Uh! Its horrible! Oh, my God! What? Did her ass explode?! Oh, screw you guys, you dont have to do it! Youre going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking! Whoa! Wow that was a big one. Hi! Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me. Well, whats he like?! Uh-huh. Of course, of course. Oh sure. Older? Oh, I was just gonna ask! Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet. Joey? Whats up? Okay whats up? Well honey, Im late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick? Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean Im really worried the babys not going to like him. Are you okay? No. Not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater? Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it? Huh. Wow, I wouldnt think Hobbs would like that so much. Um, sevene-e-eight, eight years. Wow. Yeah. So you were saying? Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, Eight years. And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and ummnow here we are. What? Who are you talking too? Oh, youre kidding! Oh, its a joke! Its funny. Its funny. I dont get it. Oh. Okay. Umm IIuh, wow. Are you uh How did umm When? Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here. Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I. Joey. No! Joey please! Please dont! Please dont leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! Can I? Oh Joey honey I dontI dont want to lose. Im so sorry. Yeah, that was a real good one. Joey? Are you in there? Hey! Is Joey here? Well, at least you make each other laugh. Well, I havent seen him since that night that he told me how he yknow I dont know, I think hes avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor? Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation? All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uhtell him I miss him. Okay, Im done. Do mine. Ah. Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab. Well just ask Mona to give it back! Hi! Hi. So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore. How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?! Oh my God! You guys have such problems! I feel so terrible for you! Oh yeah. That makes sense. Ooh, I can do that. Hi. What? Yeah its umm Yeah its uh It-its yknowIts nothing. YeahNo wait! Joey no wait it is. Its something. Its-its ummits my boss. Yeah, and umm my baby. My boss wants to buy my baby! I know I told you, its a really big problem. Can you believe that?! Thats what I told him! Well Ill tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wifeThey-they cant have children. So umm, and thatwe were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, Rachel, I want to buy your baby. Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that wouldve been a much simpler problem. Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing! Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again. Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay. Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot. What? Whoa-whoa-whoa, lets say more! What?! No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesnt want to buy my baby! I made that up! So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldnt be awkward! I cant believe that you yelled at my boss! ImIm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?! Oh Joey, I cant believe you brought my boss into this! Im gonna get fired! Well, she told me too! Morning. You wanted to see me? Okay look Mr. Zelner. Yeah. Oh God. Well, as long as we are clear about that. Hi. Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear. Chandler, can you give us a minute? Yeah. Joey, Im really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things. It kinda worked. I mean yknow, I dont know about you buy I havent thought about our thing since all this. Yeah I know! I miss that. My gynecologist tried to kill me. Hi! Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon? I, uh, think you already are. Yeah, yeah I like him a lot. Yeah, otherwise Im not going. This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom? Hmmm. Thank youwere so excited. Yeah, if youre going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area. No, I know I dont either, but ya know what, its their party, and its just one night. And we dont even have to lie we just wont say anything. If it comes up again, well justsmile. Well nod along. Oh. Unbelievable! Open it! Open it! Open it! But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular. On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isnt She Lovely as I walked down the aisle. Yeah, Stevies an old family friend. So would I. You wouldnt think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera. What? Im not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing. Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic. And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns. Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it. Well, I dont know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel. Oh yeah. Thats a great story. Shhh! I want to hear the rest! And the ring, was the size of my fist! Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible. It was really fun being married to you tonight. Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something? That proposal, at the planetarium. Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It wasreally wonderful! Did you just make that up? Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too. Goodnight. I will think about it. Hi! So, Im in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. So did they call you to tell you your names gonna be in this? Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I dont know, gal pal Rachel Green? Okay, dont listen to him. Please? Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! Im gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you. Oh yeah, Id actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea. That isthe Coast Guard. Its a trifle. Its got all of these layers. First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top! Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it! Hey, come on now! Hi! Im gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, Im the one you come too. This might be Joeys baby, who knows? Im just kiddingSeriously, gal pal Rachel Green. Yeah, thats gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well II would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of ourlives. You too! Oh, Joey! Sorry! Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain! Really? Ive never lived like this before. Oh my God, Jill! This is Chandler. And you know Monica and Ross! And thats Phoebe, and thats Joey. Dont! Yeah! Wow! I cant believe they didnt put it in the part where you said you didnt watch soap operas. Hi! So whats the final head count on my baby shower? What?! You mean theyre not coming to a social event where theres no men and theres no booze?! Thats shocking! I dont care, as long as my moms here. What?! My moms not gonna be here?! My God! So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?! Please, make sure she comes. Its really important to me, I mean its my mom! I dont know. Okay. Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I dont even have a housekeeper. Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. Well, however great she was I just cant afford that. What? Wh-wh-what? What? Yes. Yes I do. Why did you invite my mother?! She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby. Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing. What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do? Youre right. Youre right. I mean Im about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! Shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen! Okay. Mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift! Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own. But mom, I really know what Im doing. I can handle this. He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby! Wow! Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That cant be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby? Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! Whats this? Oh, it dispenses clean diapers! Well thats gross, why dont you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster? What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?! I dont know, Id leave it on the changing table? What?! Whatd I do? Whatd I do?! Oh comeOf course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who wouldshe wouldnt be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Yknow what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, Im just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful. Okay mommy, dont ever leave me. So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you? Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot. Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but II just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The babys coming and I dont know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie? Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going? Okay. Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all. No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks. Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. I do. I really do. I dont know anything. Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies? Hello?! I still dont know what the hell Im doing! I hope youre going somewhere with this. Really? Thank you. Okay! Im ready. Yes, Ive done my studying and I really know my stuff. Uh, put your elbow in it. Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers. Check if its wet, check if its hungry, burp it! A card! A card! I pick a card! Yeah but yknow what they say Mon, Theres no such thing as bad press. I didnt write it. Ross! I am freaking out! My due date is in one week! That is seven days! No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service! Im serious. Okay. Thank you. Thats great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because theres this really cute shoe store that has like this little. Oh, wait Ross! Im sorry, one more thing! Umm, our situation. Yknow umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-were having this baby together, and we live together. Isnt that, isnt that weird? Im just kidding! You can go pee! Oh. No-no-no! No, no, no, were not married. Oh yeah! Actually, thats one of the reasons why were not a couple. Oh. Oh yeah, dont get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like hes a doctor, but hes not. Oh my God! Im standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and Im bored. Hi Pheebs! Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasnt on the list. A whore. Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him. Yeah. You dont understand! You didnt see how brazen she was. No! Im not! III just think its wrong! Its-its that ImHere I am about to pop and hes out picking up some shop girl at Sluts R Us! Oh yeah! You reallyYou look great. Chandler, Im not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you. All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life? Horny bitch. No! Youre a horny bitch! Noooo! Youre the horny bitch! No! Youre a horny bitch! So you guys go, have a really good time. So, you had a good day huh? Big commission picked up a daddy. Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun. Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button. Oh okay, I see what youre doing there. Hi! Youre back from your date! Im fine, but thats not important. Whats important is how was she? Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table. No! No, shesShe was nice. I mean, shes a little slutty, but who isnt? Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones! No! Its just that, Kate bothered me. There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely! I dont want you to date her! Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I dont want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know its a terrible thing to even think this, and its completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! Im very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel. What?! Really? But Im being so unreasonable. Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. No, not really. Youre pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. Yeah. Uh-huh. Wow! I dont know, maybe. Im. I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin with you too! Oh no-no-no-no, no! No thats justThats just cause Im such a good messer! Yeah? Right! Well obviously I wont be able to come, for those of you who havent checked their calendars today is my due date. Well yknow, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great youve been during this time. I really couldnt have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant. Thats right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room! You. Like you havent done enough. God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life! Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea? Oh God, get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Cause Ill do it. They sent me home from work. They were like, Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby. Well yknow what? Screw em! If they dont want me there, Ill just hang out with you guys. What-what about me? I dont. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because Im pregnant you think Im invisible. Oh, I have to pee. If I dont come out in five minutes its because Ive choked to death on the potpourri stink. All right, whos turn is it to help me get up! Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. In a minute! All right, all right. Lets go! No, Im fine. Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable. Oh uh-uh pal! Dont call me mommy! Its bad enough you call your own mother that. Ross. Can I ask you something? When Carol was pregnant with Ben. were you this irritating? Excuse me?! Well then you just must have a natural talent for it. Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! Thats great! Hi Dr. Long, how are you? She has the drugs! Okay. Yeah. Eh, just a tad. Well, we are ready to try anything. Okay. Great! We will do all of those. Hi! No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor. Well, there is one thing that we havent tried, but someone thinks that, That will open up a can of worms. Why? Why today? Ill take that bet. Well, Im miserable here! I might as well make some money out it! Oh honey, dont worry. I really do feel like tomorrows the day. Ross IWe tried all the spicy food. Its not working. I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you. Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know whats gonna work! Its doctor recommended! Oh come on Ross, weve done it before well do it again, itll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy. Make love? What are you a girl? But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, yknow you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out. Oh, I know it. Youre right. Thats not sexy. OhOh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God! Come on Ross! Im miserable here! Come on!

Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction! Ooh! Ow! Ross. Hes looking at me. Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesnt need to be shell still have the baby before I do.

Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! Im next! Its my turn! Its only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you! Not this hospital, Im going to sue you! And my husband hes a lawyer! Go get back on that case honey! Okay, well then bring her in. Oh! I get it! Oh we-we didnt. Just tell me how. Oh hi. Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out? Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! Doctor you gotta do something!

Well ThatsyknowThatsWeve been alone for the last twenty minutes were doing okay. Besides yknow what? IIMaybe we wont be alone, cause lately IIthings have been happening between me and Ross, yknow? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Yknow? So it might be thethe beginning of something. Uh-huh. Yknow what I was, I was thinking about? Ummthat kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh? Right. No! No, of course not. No. Thats why I brought it up. They didnt have any sodas? Thats all right. And so it begins. Nothing. Really its nothing. Im just. Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone. Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs. Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right? I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh? Joey. Honey what would I do without you? Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? Theyre right on that chair under Rosss coat. Okay. Joey. Oh my God. Okay. Joey. Oh my God. Okay. So uhI guess we shouldmake it official huh? Hey you. Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too. I know, I still need to talk to you. Hi. Uhh I think I just got engaged.

Of course! Oh Joey, this ring Iits beautiful I love it! Hey! Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wont take my breast? Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth. Im sorry honey, what were you saying? Oh look, shes pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesnt she look scared? Its just so frustrating! Why doesnt she want my breast?! Hey. I need to tell you something. Joey asked me marry him. Joey proposed to me. Well, II said yes. I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much. Why not? I dont want to do this alone! And hes such a sweet guy and he loves me so much. Sure. Yeah, I mean whatever. No. No, I dont. Could you be a dear and go tell him? Hey. Surprised? I know.

Thats your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here. Okay so listen Im gonna go lay down. You know the book says that whenever shes sleeping I should be sleeping so.

I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay? You know what I really really want? I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again. I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy. No its really okay Monica! Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner? Um, Mon, Chandler's not here. Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma. Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going. She is? What about Monica. I just don't think I can bear it. Umm. Oh, ah. You need to learn some new slang. Wait. Oh! I was just going to say that I left my keys. No! Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something knock that door down! What if she jumped out the basinet? Oh my God, I left the water running. Ah, did I leave the stove on? Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there. Huh? Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true. Oh, God, Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again. We got locked out of the apartment, we. It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.

Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you. Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have? Yeah, I'll have the soup and the salmon. You guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon? Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast, to Phoebe. She dropped her sock. No, no, Emma dropped her sock. Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground. Could you please get her attention? Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration. What? Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home? So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her. That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us? Allright. Well thank you so much for coming. Really nice to meet you, and we'll call you. Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny. What, the blonde with no bra? Okay. Sandy, that's exactly what it is. Ross! Oh! Oh, that's pretty. Oh God, she mu, she must need her diaper changed. Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him. So wh? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. Why? Yes? Please? YES! Sandy you're hired. Oooh. I really can't hear what she says come here. Oh. Oh boy. Hi. Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just, was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful. I can't. I can't hear it again. Yeah! Excuse me. Look, Ross, he's just. Sandy is just sensitive, that's all. What? Too sensitive to take care of our baby? Sandy made Madeleines. Well, I, you know, III don't know what to say. I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. Okay, what? What is too sensitive? That was kind of rude! You know, he was just doing his job. Oh, come on Ross. Oh. That's true. Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. YOU! You feel! Oh, damn you Geller! Huh ha ha! Oh yeah, she can't be herself. Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with. Uh, he took the SAT's for me. Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean.

So fellas. fellas. has your girlfriend got the butt? So shake it! Shake it! Shake that nasty butt. One more time from the top. I like big butts and I cannot lie, you. Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies. Who is it? Hide my rings. Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving. Um, hi. Aw. I haven't seen you in like, a year.

Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um. Ross, could I talk to you in private? Um look I was thinking. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving. Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond. Ross, you know what? She may need one. We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment. Hi. Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon. Oh we just put her down for a nap. Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby. See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby. Monica is Ross' sister. Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly, you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate. Well actually. Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just, you're more the fun parent. UCHH! Yeah, yeah right. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby? What? What carrer? Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear. Sup. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby. I did the first time! Oh. Oh. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you. Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child. uh huh. Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings? Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him! I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today. ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five. You take that back. Take it back! Heey man, I work out. I do pilates. Bring it on! Did you just push me? Alright. Thats it! Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy! Ew! Gross. Amy runs towards Rachel and Rachel puts her arm out, hand on Amy's head and Amy starts trying to hit her but is missing, Rachel is moving backwards towards the table when her hand swipes the one plate left on the table on to. Mon, I'm so sorry. Are you okay Mon? Look Amy, it got a little of control. Um, and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh, if it really means that much to you. Uh. No. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount. She needs changing. Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good. Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened. Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way. Phoebe's Mike? I didn't know you guys hung out. Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about? Yeah. Hey. Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross. Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye. Oh God. It seems like forever ago. Well, um. I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a, ah, little thing. Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little, um, eye-contact. Mm-hmm. Oh. Should we send them something back? No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here. Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b, baby and a Ross. Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato. That's my bubby! Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. I'm sorry, no. Oh sure. Great. I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse. No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before. Yeah. Me too. Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it. Yeah. Me neither. Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling? Yeah. That works for me. Oh, thanks. Wha, hey! Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just, move on with my life. I don't know. Do I have to decide right now? Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone. Oh give me, Hi, Mike? Hi. Listen. I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what? If you do this I. Phoebe will, do anything you want. Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff. Hi. Oh. Wow. So, what did you guys do? That was fun Pheebs. See you guys. Oh shoot. I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks. Wait, wait. Sorry. Did he call? Did that guy call? Oh, around 8:30? Then, again at 9:00? Yeah. Aaah. Oh, it was so much fun. It felt so good to be out. Yeah? Yeah, I can't wait to go back to work. Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back. We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and. Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for. Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a. That's right! Oh, it's a Macy's bag! Oh. Dear losers, Wiper blades. I don't even have a car. Well, because if one more person says what a cute little boy I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna! That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl. I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff. Who the hell are you!? I'm the hell person whose office this is! Excuse me? Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job? A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw. Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. Excuse me? Can you please, please take care of it for me? Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job? That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp. Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department? Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue? Oh, hi Mr. Zelner. That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to? Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power. Today. No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening. Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me. Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out. I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today? Come on, I don't know what else to do. Ross? You're pretty. Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to? Hey, they were popular when I left! Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed? Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up! Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this? Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in! Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything! Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon. What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour. Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him! No, I can't, I have a baby. Why would you do that? That's really nice. Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you. Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me. Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside. OK, thank you. Oh, wow, Molly is just great! What? You really think she's hot? And Joey? Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross? Thank you! So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. Hello. Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology. Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious. No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And II think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you. Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy. I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished. I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out! Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep. Oh yeah, I'm jealous. Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass. Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate. That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship. It was, oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just Tag. You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses. Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous. Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh! Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her. Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away. Rachel Green's office! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh, ok then. I'll pass you back to your son. Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you. If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror? Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you momma's boy, starting right now. Hi! Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle. Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother. Why did you invite him? I can't stand that guy! I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake? Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit! Shh! I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see. God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me. What? Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over. Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her? Yeah, sure! Oh, give me! Ahhhh, you brought rats to my birthday party? Are you comparing my daughter to a rat? whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats? Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up? Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over. Mmm hmm. No. Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at. 9:30? God! Oh, this party was lame. Oh, you bought me a present! Why? Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card. From Gavin. Awww, awww, it's beautiful. See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time? Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me. You do? See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you, and you do that. Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid. No not that. I kissed Gavin last night. Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and. You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf. You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line is a scarf! I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just. I don't. Or. I could call in sick and not deal with it at all. Who is it? Why? Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin. I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick. Oh no no no. So did I. It's just a cold. What? What's the matter? Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny. Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain! Oh! Molly! You're not Ross. Right, right, yes! What? No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly. OK. I thought it was Ross. There isn't. There is totally isn't. All right. Look. Gavin. I. I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in. Yes. People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin. So seriously rodeo clown? Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you everywhere! Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a. Who? You’ve being seeing someone? Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother. Wow. She does that a lot! What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like. Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now? How do you know about that? Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me? Score. Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time! Yeah. Oh yeah. What? Who? Whoa, how do you know about that? Why didn’t I get that message? From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message? Ross? Why? Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get? Yes. Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you. Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they. And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know, Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while? Thank you. Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning. Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma. Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so. Bye! Hey! You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight. Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. Why? What's the big deal? What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set. So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay? Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah. Thanks, you guys. Have fun! Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken. Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you. What? Well, come on, Steve let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive. Really? What's that like? Really? Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you! This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep? I don't care! This guy is a nightmare! He's not stoned. Yeah, four times. No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry. Don't touch my coat! Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello? Oh my god, this is the worst date ever! No. What? What do you mean, there you are? Where was she? Well, uh. Really, really not. All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve. I just had a rough night. Eww! Oh, well, I. It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but. Yeah. Oh. Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left? Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up. Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this. Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show. Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. You got it! Your agent called. You got that audition. Yes. Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it… You saw that? Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. Oh, anything yet? Joey, that was formula. Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. Hi you guys! Oh er, well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment. No. I was just going to do this myself. Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this? Monica would you please tell Joey that he is a pig? Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself! There is a hardware store right down the street? This is easy. Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. Hi! Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks. Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm. Your game. Don't look at me I never get his jokes. Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder. I don't know! I mean, what brought that on? No you really think that's what it is? Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time! Argh. fascist. Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too! Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!? Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job? Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys. I'm so sorry Pheebs. Hey! How was basketball? Oh, no! Who did that? She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it? Joey, are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him! All right. Oh, Emma loves him!  Step away from the crib, I have a weapon! What are you doing? Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom. Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore. Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's. Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail. Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it? Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy. Yeah, I think she wants the old one back. Joey, come on! I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy? Original. Then what's that big lump under your covers? That's not Monica! Oh God. Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey! Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much. Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't, but whatever. Oooh, you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack! Are you gonna, you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child? Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut? Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker. Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying. Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there! She dropped off a casserole? What's going on? Well, there's two spots left right? Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands. You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win? Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape and you're gonna be all like oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai. I don't really care about the Knicks. You would do that? I never get picked! I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word. Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes. Ooh, I have another idea! Well, well, well, look what mommy found! Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your special tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends? Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong? All right, believe me. If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us! OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets! Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets. Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work. No, she was just much better at job than me! You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down. Hi mum, put her back on! Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words! She said gleba! Isn't that amazing? Why-why aren't you more excited? Oh, but of course it is! I don't know all the words. Ok. Emma just said gleba! Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up. Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba. Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi. You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win. What? So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your 3? Me too. I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less. Woow! I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog! Are you serious? Hey, that was an honest mistake! Yeah, that was an awesome day! Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity? Oh, please! Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm. OH MY GOD! Is that Christian Sanders? He's so gorgeous! Oh, in my head he's done some pretty not-gay-stuff! Ok, not that you need it but good. GOD! Is that Chase Lassiter? He's straight, right? Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry, good luck! OH! SSSHHHHTTT! He's asking her a question! NO! Or, cut! You know, that's your call! Hi! Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing! God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress. Oh screw her, that part is mine! Okay. Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here. Kiss me. Kiss me. No, I'm saying. just, don't talk. Ehhh, aw! Well, that's new! Can I ask you a question? Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? Ok, well this is like that, in no way. I had a. I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey. Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense. I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday. Olivia. So do you think that my dream means anything? Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream. You took the same class twice. Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work. Ok, we're still on that. Hey! Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? How, how? uh-huh. Wow, definitely just Drake. What, how is it going with Drake? What, that scene I saw was so good! Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment? So? Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before? Ok, this could be a little awkward. I'm just going to blow past it, well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? Alright, alright look, just uh, just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. Joey, you never, you never talked about that before. Oh, sorry. Oops, sorry. Ooh, oooh, oh, ah. Can I ask you a question? Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and, and not have it be a big deal? No reason. Yeah. Nobody, forget it! Maybe. Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said. Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time! Ok, off the top of my head. Don and Janet. I know them from work. No, one of them. I don't know, what were the names I just said? All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? Hey! Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You are having a party tonight? And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that? You do that every year? Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us? And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant? OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory? Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties? Well, then so you just invite me.! Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please. OH, a soap opera roof party! I'm going to a soap opera roof party! Oh my God, oh my God! And it's out of my system! Hey. Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play. I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know. I was watching this thing on TV this morning about. Newcastle disease, and I think I might have it! Ok, who is this? Oh, hi! I would check your hand but. I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease! Sure! Oh. What? Yes, I am! When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is! Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you! And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you! Ok professor or detective? Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory! Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number. Nice to meet you. Ok. Yeah! Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler! I always loved that! Come on! I think this is funny! Just some boys gave me their phone numbers. I think I am. Why, why, what's wrong with these guys? Joey, you're so sweet. Who? What? Really? Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! Oh, Very funny. Joey. Hey! I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey. Please, what about you and Chandler? Well hello! I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey! I'm gonna do it. No. I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD! Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know, and I, want him to hook up with lots of women! I just. All I'm saying is. I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common. All right, so. Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean. Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them? Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive! Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO. Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting. Well, I would like to have the option! Oh! Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks! I don't care about any of that! Oh! Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe! Fine, I won't use it! I promise. But I am going hunting! Hi there! Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate. And, taped back together. Ok. through the glass doors. Alright-y then.

Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden? Damn! I wish I knew if that was right! Wow, Ikea, what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse. Yah! She's, uhm, not very good though. I don't know, maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar. Phoebe! For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden! How could you not tell me you worked here? Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage! Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here? Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any! Good for you Pheebs! Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show! Oh. Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not. I was justI was just reading to Emma. Yeah, yeah. It's. climax your way to better skin.

Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies! Sure! You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff. She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her! I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet. I mean, nobody else has a chance! Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom. Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him. It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous! Oh, I get it! I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal. So can we keep this between us? Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me! Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard! Ok, great! Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying! Well, get back in there and talk! What!? Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too! Oh! What are we gonna do? Oh my God! Alright! Enough out of you! Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard. Ok. Wha? where? Where are you going? Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been? Oh! Wi, in the dres, in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room.

I try. No, that's David. Tip of the iceberg. Do you have anything that would, get us out of them? Hey! Hey what's going on? Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed! Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy. Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler. What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season. It's not the time Charlie. You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. Well, I usually go, play Tetris on somebody else's computer. Ugh. Well, I've brought some books. We could read. We can't. We're not pharmacists! Kate Miller? And, that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend. Thank you. I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home. Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts. No. No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain. No. Joey! Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen. Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is? Do ya? Later! La. Ok. See you, bye. Open your drapes! Open your drapes! Nooo! Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan, so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous! Homo. All right! Well, uh, we're gonna hit the beach? It was really, great! Oh! Oh! Weather bitch! It's open! Hi, Joe! What, is everything ok? Nooooo, why? Oh, that's crazy!  yeah, it's true. What, hey! WWhat are you, what are you talking about? Ok, uh, maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl. Yeah, I'm not talking about her. You know? Forget it! No, IIII don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So! Yeah, sure! Ok, let's not make a big thing about this! Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will! Only like a month! What the. DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about, you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little! Shoot! I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know. I mean, aren't you just a, little curious, what that would be like?. Who? Oh yes, of course, I remember him! Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about! But can it, just, happen a little bit? But why, why not? But that wasn't gonna stop you before! I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything! It's not a big deal! It's so not a big deal! Ok! Ok, I. AAAHHHH! What? I know, I'm her! ooh. Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed? What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk? Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant! Oh, okay, just hide! Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed! There's no room under the bed. Yeah. Hi. I really don't. Yeah, sure. Uh-huh, right, yeah. Oh, I know. I know it's been really hard for you. That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say. You would think! Joey! How are you doing this? How, wha. Hey! What are you. What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time? Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade! All right, look you guys. Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it. Sure. Get out! Are they right? Yeah. Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight. Although. I mean, you know. Ross and I haven't dated in like, six years. Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now. No. Yeah. Forgotten. Nothing. Nothing. It's really. It's nothing. Come here, come here. Sorry, I just uhm. I can't seem to get Ross out of my head. Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him. Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner. Still nervous? Yeah! Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! So hi! So you eh, you talked to Joey? Oh! That's great! Oh, so everything's okay? Ah. Well, obviously I think so too. Really? Excited? Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you? Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him. That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams. Aaah. Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about. Okay, uhm, alright, here's the deal. What? What is it? Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy. Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo? Well, yeah. Okay, look it's about me and. Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time. Hi! Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again. Yeah, 'cause that's what we do. Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't. No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then? Goo-ood night! Seriously, good night! Okay. We weren't doing anything! Shhh. No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados. Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill. We feel so terrible about this, Ross. Ross? Can we just close the door? Ross, say something. Anything. No, no, no! Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts. No, but you know what I mean. Calm ourselves? Well, what would we be doing? Feel me up? Hey. Oh, you bet. Okay, well, we brought you some wine. Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some. No awareness. Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this. Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on! Ooy. Oh my god, are we supposed to answer? Ross, you don't seem okay. Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me. You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too. No, no, it's just that it's getting late. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this. So. I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok. I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that! Ok, so sorry. I am sorry! Again. I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous! Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great. Absolutely! Absolutely. I d, it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to. Ok, let’s work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe! Okay. Oh! Ow! Well this is romantic! It’s a standard issue bra clasp! Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra? oooh! Oh oh! oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic? Well, it was good, until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away! Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra! I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me. Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through! No need! Problem solved, we are powering through. Hey! Got champagne? Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through. Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it! Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh? You like that? Let's take this into high gear. Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it! What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok? What is the matter with us? No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this, difficult? Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to, more than that? No, no, no. No, I mean, se-x-u-ally. Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us. Right, totally. Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex. Hmmm. Me too. I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it? Aah. I bet you're right. Yeah. Love you too. Alright, I'm going to bed. Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday! We're having a party. No, that day, that won't be her real birthday! Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day? And I mean, you know, you guys. This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle! You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all. Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18. Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon. I said it's still nap time. Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on? Oh, she's still napping. Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again. No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up. Oh! Emma might like what? What did you get her? Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now? All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us. So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us? Oh, ok, which one? Wow! That was amazing! Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well. Is that it? Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge. Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s. Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing! Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny. Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis! Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself! Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home. Joey, don't touch it! Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts! OOH! God! Sorry! Emma's awake. I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake. Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday. And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me. I guess. Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing Happy Birthday. Then we would all go into. HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER! They have to learn! What? Oh my God! Look what, you made it into a bunny. How did you do that? Well, I'm very impressed. I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys! What? Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many! NO, no science camp! Oh! Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly! Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted. Yeah. Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really. I've never given her a cookie. Have you? Of course, I'd be honored! OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex. Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey? So now, what are you doing here? Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby! Oh, I know, isn't she? All right. What's your news, Amy? What? Oh my God! To who? AAnd? No, what's he like? Yeah. Huh, wow, so he's gotta be. Sweety, I gotta tell ya, it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like. Oh, sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry? Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about! Ok. Ok, let’s keep talking. Amy, hi! Oh, good for you! Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you! But Erin Brockovich had her own house. Yeah. Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’ Joey, I can’t do that! Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here. No, it's just, look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me. Well, uhm, whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok. Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door. Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future. Well, what happened? Oh, that is so tacky. Phoebe, that’s huge! I think it could be kind of great! Uuuh! How about at a Footlocker? Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago! Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh. God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today? Menstrual cramps. Can any of you watch Emma? Great, shoot, what are we gonna do? Well, actually. Yeah. Why not? Wha, the next one? Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being! Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world? Absolutely. Hey! Hi, how's my girl? Yeah! You pierced her ears!? Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out. Ugh. Nah, I don't really want her to see. Nothing. Oh, they're real! I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again! I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me? Oh yeah? Since when? What? Babies don't care if they're slim. Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out! You put holes in my baby's ears! I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help. Excuse me? Joey, where are those bags? Seriously? Hips or thighs? Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins. Oh, I can give you that. Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're, you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are. Did you just say Emma? So how is the uhm, baby styling business going? That's shocking! Hi! My God! Mmh-mmh! Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends? GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, Guy-in-van? Oh! Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band? Hi! I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in. Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys. Who's Gladys? Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous! Well, I mean, sure, of course. But, you already gave that to Monica, so. No, I couldn't let you do that. But I don't want you to. But I insist harder! No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad! Did you watch the tape? But you are a liar. Well, this is going well. Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? Well, hey! How about right above the TV?. That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door! Oh! There's nothing above your bed! O-oh my God! Joey, what, is, this thing, doing here? Joey, we're not keeping this! Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted. Well, legend has it Joey, that, she comes alive when you're asleep. She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob. Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. Yes I can! She's yours! She's yours! She's mine! She's mine! I want Gladys! She's mine! She's mine! Excellent! Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old. Oh, don't be such a baby! Hi! Emma will be up in a minute! Oh hey Ross. Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry. Absolutely. So, uhm, what are you gonna do today? Oh my God, what!? Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground. All right, well, if you must know. I had a traumatic, swing incident, when I was little. Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks! Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes. Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're, and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth! All right! Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment! Ok, careful. Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR! I know but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out. Ok. Ok. Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it! Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push? Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag. Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay? Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life. Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt? I know what this is all about. You've always been jealous of my hair. Alright fine. I'll do it. If you hold a spider. IF you hold a spider. Ok. I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one. Ok. Ok. O-k. Ok. whoo, ok, wow, ok. OH! A-alright! I can do this. That's because he's on your neck. ROSS! Hi! I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving! It's not? When was she born? Hi! Happy Thanksgiving! Did you at least win the contest? Can't wait! Yeah. Well, let's see, uh. I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why? Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard! Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful! Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy. And a thousand dollars. is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important. Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving? Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid. Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid! Phoebe, I think. It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on! Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner! Phoebe, you have to calm down. Really? You heard them say that? All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about! No, what? No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby! Because I already did! No. What are you doing here! And I won! Yes! YES. Yes! Yeah. That's me! She won a thousand dollars! Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap. Alright, Emma is napping, what happened to your shirt? You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad. Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready?. Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time. Alright, come on. Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together. You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning. Huh. OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Oh, I know. I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door. You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. Oh! So bad. Dessert? Congratulatioooons! Ewww, is that what that is? Yeah! I'll cook! Hey! I lent them to Ross. I'm so happy for you! Hey, who's Phoebe with? Do you think I'm someone else? Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else! Hi! Oh! Well, it's a little low, pick up a little, a little bit more, a little bit more. There you go! Now throw it away! Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that. NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat. Hi. what? Oh! Oh, no! Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and. Oh no! Not me! Emma! Ah, this place is great! Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! I mean, this is just beautiful! Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants. Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m. I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. Why do men keep talking to me like this? Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing. My God, get a room! Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food? No, you gotta pick one! You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma. Yeah. Oh, no, no. That is a doll. Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty. He's not having an affair! No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you! Oh, that doesn't mean anything. Dude, Where's My Car? They're in a caaar. Geez! Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun. I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy! Oh, look at her, so happy! Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester. Who's Nancy? Are you serious? What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it! Yeah it is. Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live! C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a a purse, y'know? Or a or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha It's a metaphor, Daddy! Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. You're fly is open, Geller! Ow, that had to hurt! No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. Oooohh that’s interesting. 14? Space cowboy! Ow. Oh Gosh! Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster! Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean! That is not true. She did! She forced me! Well it stupid, unfair question! Hey, what's-what's going on?! Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving. Yeah, I do. II do, do that. Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold. And a crappy New Year. You can't move. You just, you just can't. Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and, maybe close your blinds at night. Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone. Aah! Why? What are these for? Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out. Oh, d'you like it? What? Pheebs, I, there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that. Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party. Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's! Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could! Uh! The police! Yeah? All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find! No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book! This is so awesome! College guys are so cute! I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! It. You can so totally tell. Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going. Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. Bitchin' Oh. I am sooo drunk. I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow. Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now? Oh, what a line. Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of. Hey! Yeah okay. No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have? So maybe something in an office. Really? Yeah. Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix. Uh. November? Hey Pheebs. Uhm, you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet. Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave! Goody, what is it! What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that. Happy wedding day! Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages. What d'you want? Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is! Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too! Oh, you are the lesser of two evils! Hi. Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross. All right fine, I pick you. Oh my. Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other. Who's there? Uh. You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick. Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog. Since when do you watch the news? Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street? Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted! Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. Geez Ross, you could have showered. How was the honeymoon? Oh! I did not know you spoke French. Oh, you're so sexy! Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya. Ross. My father had an heart attack, while I was at Barney’s. Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated. No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own. Ok. If you really need to. Oh, I really could. Ohh. Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green. Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here. Can somebody please go in? Ross, please, don't be so scared of him! Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh? Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok? Hi! Uh. Did you call your parents? Oh good. What? What do you mean? You've been in my room before! Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name. Yeah. Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick! Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital! What? Really, I shouldn't feel guilty? Ok, maybe you're right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while? Ok. Thank you for coming with me today. Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room! I just don't want to be alone tonight. Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we? Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy! Wow. Ok. Mhm-mh! Sure. Hmm-hmm. Yep. FYI. In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it. Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied! Oh stop that! Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me. Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. What? Oh, good. Okay. Hey listen, just before you go II again, I just wanna say thank you for coming with me. And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and, it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again. It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good. Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time? You know it was you're uhm, birthday. Well, I guess that's all in the past, now. Not even one more time? No matter how much we want it. That's what we decided. It's kinda hard though! You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's, just seems like such a, waste. Ross? Just so you know. With us, it's never off the table. Hi you guys. Ooh, Italian! Hey you guys. You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me. Congratulations! Ooh! Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell, with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing. Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else. But my, but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job. Sssshhhh! Hi. I'm on a date. Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career. You gotta get out there. Oh. Yes, hi! Hi! Excuse us. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh he's cute! Wha. My resumé? I wouldn't. I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé. Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh? What? II don't. No, III love it there. Oh! It's not good. Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren. Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said Wait a minute! Yes I am. and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact, was true. Oh it, good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days. Ah, all right. Here's to Ross! No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job. Oh! No, it's okay, you didn't know. Oh, thank you. Well, now I don't have to. Ross, what is taking you so long? Mark? Oh my God! I'm fantastic. You remember Ross? Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day. No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work. Well, screw charity work. What've you got? Great! I'll call ya! Oh my God! Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him. Yes. Oh. What? You don't want me to get a job? Ugh. Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. Hi you guys! Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet. Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins. He offered me one. I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great. The job is in Paris. He offered me one. The job is in Paris. Oh, God! Please, somebody say something. I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's, really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out. Anything we want. Thank you! Thank you! I think it is. I got a really incredible job offer. It's in Paris. Look, you guys, this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board. Joey, it would mean so. Joey. Hi. Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her. Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back! Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. No, I'm still going. When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great? Hi! You are never going to believe what happened to me today. Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money. Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron. I don't even know what department that guy's in. Well, I took it. Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice. Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely. Oh.! Yeah, but you know, this is, it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can. Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-toNewYork scared. Or uhm, when I-found-outI-was-gonna-haveEmma scared. But this is, fine. This is gonna be good. What? You really think so? But I already told Zelner that I would come back. All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris. Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross! Oh! Oh, I'm so happy. Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose. Oh, that sounds good! It's all done! I know. Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane. Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them. It should be right next to my plane ticket. What? Maybe I put it in here. Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes! Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this! No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine. Well, I've been better. You guys are gonna come and visit me, right? I'm gonna miss you so much. You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here. Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start. Oh, oh. What is this? I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture! I love you Phoebe. All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going. Ok. Monica? Can you come here with me for a minute? Mon. Okay. I've gotta, just say what it is I'm gonna say. None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me. I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you. I. I. I. Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get. Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with. Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room. Can I talk to you alone for a minute? Oh honey. Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. Okay. Oh. Oh! Oh. Well. I think I'm gonna take off. Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night. What? Ross. You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care? I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me. Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go. Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye. Oh! What? WHAT? So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. What?! Shh. Go back to sleep. I have to go home. It really was. You've learned some new moves! Ah. I know! Morning! Hey. Good. You? Chick and the duck? Didn't they die. You too. Last night was just wonderful. I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face. Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. Hi! Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's. No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday. Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma! Yeah? Gunther. Oh. I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw. Oh. Bye guys. Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby! Oh my God! Hi! Oh my gosh! Oh. What. What. Aw. Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful. Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane. Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much. I will. Ross, come here. I just want you to know. Last night. I'll never forget it. Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there. Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said! Oh. Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this. I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size. Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem. Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it! Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person. Hello? Yeah. Phoebe? Is everything okay? What? Why? Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane. Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris. Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange. I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right. Well. Wait, what are you doing? Could I get some peanuts? This is ridiculous! I. Yeah, okay. Oh my God. What. What are you guys doing here? What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on? Yeah? What? Oh my God. I - I have to get on the plane. Yes, I do. They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things. And. And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane. Excuse me? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them. Oh, please, miss, you don't understand! Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off. I got off the plane. I do love you. Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again. Okay. You and me, alright? This is it. I know. It seems smaller somehow. Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time? Okay, should we get some coffee?
