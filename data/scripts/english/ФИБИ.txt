I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. I can't believe what I'm hearing here. What I said. Oh, was I doing it again? Oh, yeah! Then I've already seen this one! She's already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that -but, it's fine! Monica Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.

It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing. Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not mine'. Okay. I'd just I'd never be able to enjoy it.

Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a, while.' Hey, Lizzie. I brought you alphabet soup. Yes.

Does anyone want the rest of this PopTart? Sorry. Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. What is up with the universe?! Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu no, I'm not. There it is! You know, you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just I. Did he mention us? If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest. And bigger boobs! Oh! What what what! Hi. I got no sleep last night! My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! Thanks. I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? Look, look, I have elbows! Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! You are just like Jack. No, Jack and the Beanstalk. Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village. Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. Floopy? Oh, like that's a word. Oh, well. 'cause, you just. I don't like this question. What?

She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but. Yeah. But he's falling in love with her. Ok. Oh, ok, oh. Hey, what's going on? Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god!

Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore. No, but you can't. Uh uh. Petrie. Did I miss it, did I miss it? I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical. They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry. Thanks, Ross. Ok. Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress. Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next la la. This is so great. I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting. Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben to the rescue. Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. You guys, he's beautiful! Susan, he looks just like you. Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes. Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again. Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? Yes. 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice. Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? All right, so what were you thinking? Oh. No. Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak. I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings. I'm still on no. What's goin' on? Ewww! Where? Hey, hey Ross. Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass. All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it. All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing. All right, that's it, I quit. Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person. Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it. Demi Moore. Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten. Oh, oh, oh my god! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore? Oh, she's got gorgeous hair. It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in. Thank you. You wanna do it right now? Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right? Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you. Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him? I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet. Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. Woof, woof. What? Oh, all right. What did I have? Oh, no wonder I don't feel full. I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad. Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur. Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs. Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras. Ben, dinner! Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. I licked my arm, what? So? You won't even taste it? Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. Come on. It doesn't taste bad. You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that. Wait, wait, wait, wait! You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason. I miss Janice though. Hello, Chandler Bing. Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles! I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true. Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution? Nah. Not really. I don't know, it's just, you know monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy. Yeah, I just don't buy it. Ok, don't get me started on gravity. Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just. I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed. Just don't. Look at this funky shirt! Really? You can actually see it? See, I didn't know that. Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why? Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts. Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't. What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope. He's even kind of cute. I'd call that excessive. Janice? You called Janice? Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man. Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities. Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this? I can't believe you caved. You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry? Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you. Uh huh. Why is that? Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone! You're there! Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card. I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve. OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend. I might have. Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace. You have a third nipple? Yeah, is there a hair on it? Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades. OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. Hi. Ta-da. Hi. Do I? Thank you, so do you. Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice. Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo. OK. Oh, right, OK. Ole. Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha. So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday. Ohh. K. How come? What? Huuh. I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties. So how long have you known? And um, and there's actually a, a woman? Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with? Sure. I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.' Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago? So, um, have you told your parents? Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who, no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better. So your brother's straight huh? Seriously. Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20? It's Ross. Can you believe how much this is gonna cost? Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross. Let's see! Wow, look at these prices. Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care. No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen. I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just. Not for you. Fine. All right, fine. Well, then. Let's. No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert. Yeah. Oh, it's like a skit. Cool. So. Thank you. Actually, it makes us feel that big. I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now. Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. Fine. Ok. One. We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get-is that a hickey? Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck. Oh. Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower. I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget. Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed. But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk. And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top. Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. Really? Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get? Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing. Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid. No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la.  with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player? Right. My name was on there, but now it just says carrot cake So, um, so um, how many chords do you know? Oh yeah, so you know D? Ok, do you know A minor? Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor? Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap? Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords. Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk! You're all invited to bite me! Oh, hi. Thank you. Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better. No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang SuSuSuicide, I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, Smelly Cat, I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat. It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money. Really? From who? Yeah. Here you go. No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's smelly cat, smel-ly cat. Better. Yeah. Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song. You wanna try it again? Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me? Mmmm hmmm. That's too much. Sorry. No, you are not, you are very attractive.

Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make hands meet. Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champange, nice. Nope, zilch, nothin', uh-uh. Look, I, ya know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, ya know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up? No, whad'ya mean. He's not British.j. Oohh, um, no I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like, definitely felt something. No, I felt it on my hip, you could tell. Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look. So, I figured it out. Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough. Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet. You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. Hey Joey. How come your watching a rabbi play electric guitar? So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did. And we did. Yay me. Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on. He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I would gonna get all, ya know, like, ohh, is he gonna call me the next day and, ya know, where is this going and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious. Yeah, so I said, OK, relax please, ya know, I mean sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, ya know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. I convinced him. Um-hum. Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues? Oh. Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a I gotta have you now kind of thing? Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back? Wow. What are you gonna use it for? Hey, oh, so, um how'd you make out last night? Oh, well, actually. Ok, all right. Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, Two of Them Kissed Last Night. There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide! It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y. What makes it pilgrim? No offense, but that sounds nothing like her. Oh, oh sweet lord! This is what evil must taste like! I, I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus. What were you thinking? Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.

This is my father, this is a picture of my dad. No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you. No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born. OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy. It's not a blue screen, it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'? Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again? Just, you know, to see, um. OK, is this really my father? OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire. Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. Oh God. Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones? OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? Oh. Oh. Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. OK, um, in Ithica, alright, um, Saratoga. Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name. Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.

You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter. Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one. Yeah? You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping. Oh, I couldn't go in. Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now. Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas? You guuuyys. Although, you know what. You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your, royal subject. OK. The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction. Are, are you OK? Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better. Fun Bobby is so great. Half full of luuuv. Cabin of luuuv. Two. Yeah. Ooh, OOOH, yeah, ya know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soo bombed,' or, umm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.' Um, cake. Soo, what's goin on, huh? Ohh, why? Hey. Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green? Oh, no. Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do like a soap opera theme. Hey, Rach, what time do you get off, we're all gonna do something tonight. But you guys came so close. That is funny. It's not that bad. Ok, ok, don't get all squinky. Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull, you just, you know, set it free. Rachel, um, hi. OK. So, you know what you're doing right? Well yeah, but no.

I couldn't uh. Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman. Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage. Little did she know God was thinking, Ok, but that's it. Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far. I think it went into me. Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time. I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up! I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales. I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales? In my day, divorce was not an option. That's him. Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. Um, do you wanna sit? I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? Everything? Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty. Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face. Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out. Sir! No sir! Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. I miss Rose. I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone. Ok, that's so nice. Yeah, me, too, technically. I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin. Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake? Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now. I know, I know. Hello. Hi Rob Dohnen. Oh, wow. Oh, I would love to have kids, you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them. I know. No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me? OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe. OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la. There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do. Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back. Yay, I rock. But.

Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens! Fired! Why? I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth? I see. No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur? Who's Barney. OK, Rachel, I'm ready. Um, yeah I guess that's me. Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la. OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you? I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme. Stick a fork what? Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.

Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh. Here we go. You're not going? What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said? I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss.

Do you want to get this tattoo? OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you? OK, who is the boss of you?! No. You are the boss of you.

So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered. Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK. OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat. I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video. I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album. I'm done now. Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back? OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that? OH! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know. OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat. Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go. Hey. Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video. Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK. Oh my God. I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear. Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented. Hey. Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video. Yes. Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue. Well, I can't work with people who would do this. I mean this poor woman. The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video. Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody. Monica. Chandler. Rachel. Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more. No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh hello, human-rights violation. CHANDLER: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women an everybody has a pretty good time. PHOEBE: Why don't you play with your roommate? Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy? Oh yeah, it'll be fun. Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other. EDDIE: Yeah alright, that sounds alright. Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why h would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye. CHANDLER: That was so lame. I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night. RICHARD: Phoebe's got another job, right? I know. Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, an that is a lot, I like you the best. RICHARD: Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet. Ok. Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests. Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture. JOEY: Ooh, I look good. Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines? Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks. Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say. MONICA: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice. CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that? Hey. Oooh, so so so, did you read the book? Didn't it like totally speak to you? Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it. Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers. Yeah. Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind. No, 'cause he's yummy. Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip. Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?' I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you. Um-um, um-um. Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no. What? Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date. Paul. Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone. I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again. Yeah. Is anyone else starting to really like him? Hey. Watcha guys doin? Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie. C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun. What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy? Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'. He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said. What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END. Hey. Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment. Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself. Hey. Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes. Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies. With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud. Yeah. It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this. Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease. Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. Sure. Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off. Me too. Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip. Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does. Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there. No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet which is my father's last name. And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so. Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him. Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist. Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'. Thanks. Hey, hey, no, oh oh. No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no. Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem. Are you crazy? Yeah, I don't know. I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right. Ok, thanks. Sorry, again. What was that? Hey. Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow. Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so still hoping. I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.' Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. So talk to her. Hi. It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian. Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast. Sure, oh, is, is Frank home. Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here? Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior. Ok so will he be back soon? Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry. Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too. Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe? Oh. Stilts? Wow. I don't know what to do with that. Yeah. I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.' That'll work too. Yeah, that'd be ok. Ok, I'm in the book. Alright. So um, stilts huh? Ok. Hey nice boobs. Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are. Why not her? I'm sorry, I didn't know. Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents. Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth? Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake? And because you're both, you know, white women. Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so. Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. Listen if you wanna go, just go. Alright, I can get you out. Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back. Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster? Great, I'm seeing water rings again. Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute. No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious. There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door. Everything you've heard is true. Ok, welcome to the fu-oh. Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go. Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe. Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway. Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish. Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York. Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy. Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change. No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay. Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look! Yeah? Are you sure, really. I, I, I'm hideous. Come in. Hey Ryan, what's up? Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox. Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian. 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are. Ohh, ohh. Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now. Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox. And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me. Oh, I am scary. I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this. Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had. That you don't stop talking about it. Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go. Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice. No. This is what I do for luck, ok. No. No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes. Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. Give it. Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder. Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch. It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up. Please. I got it. What? Oh. You know what, that's it, that's it. Ok, I'll walk you out. I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. Bye you. Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh. All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again. Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. Oh my God, you look so good! Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action? All right, stop it, you're freaking me out. I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like. Come on, like you never talk that. Bye, good luck. So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that. What does she mean by HH? Are you the cutest? You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy. It could be like a big giant guy. We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl. Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?' Well at least we know she's a woman. Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong? Oh, my. She wants to meet you in person. What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip. Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to. Hello. Thank you! I know, though. Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny. All right all ready. We could not, would not want to wait. I don't know, you might be the first one. Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message? Is that too spooky? Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys! What am I gonna do? Monica, Monica, you know what gets out humus. Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that. Humus. I got the humus. That won't go with this dress though. Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place. Monica, you don't know that. Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi! Okay, I'm ready. Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.' Duh! Christmas! Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys? Definitely. I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that. Okay, we're on it. We're on it. Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed. Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out. Ross, went to get a cab so we can all. No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no! How did you do that? Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself. Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you. What? Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward. Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously. Oh, you're not a dingus. Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay. Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying? Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay. Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee? Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more. Hi! Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today. Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order. Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute. No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'deUrsula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her. Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather. Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going. Oh, yeah. What's this? Um, not even a little bit. Oh, okay then. Good. So what were you thinking? Really? Oh. Oh, okay. Hellooo! Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'. Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me. Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything. What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? What are you saying I should do? Thank you, Monica. Yes? Yes! Oh. Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister. Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train? No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch. Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go? Oh, oh! It's on again! Hey. Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me! Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. III meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play. That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault. What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh. No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.' 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.' 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen. Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again? 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.' 'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next. Op, went through a tunnel. It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before. Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time. Two? Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right. Helloo! Oh! No it's not, sorry. Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those. pants. Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit. Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent. Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I. Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah. Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on. Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial. No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that. Um, the offBroadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb'. Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.' Oh. Yeah, no, I understand. Yeah. Sorry. What? Oh, you caught me. I am so busted. Hey! No, but he's always late. Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.' No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me. Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank. This is everybody. This is Ross. Chandler. Joey. This is Monica. And this is Rachel. I'm gonna get coffee. Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything. Oh, ew! Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad. Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that. Feburary 16th. Wow, that's close. When's yours? That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home? Okay so, by melting, you meant melting. So is it like art? Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom? Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache. G'night, bro. Here. Y'know, just in case. No kind. He just makes it up. So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and. Ah! Oh, how do you play the shadow game? I just asked you. I don't have time for this. Which you just gave up really quickly. Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly. Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um. Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff. Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah! All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me? No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for? No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited? Hey!Hey! What's going on? You can't have sex with her! Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes. So that's what you thought I did! God! That's not what I do! Nooo! Why would you think that? Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways. You really thought it was perfect? Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you? I don't. Right, okay, um-mm. Yeah, I guess I do, yeah. Well, II wasn't hopping mad, y'know. Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this. Uh-huh. She wasn't a hooker. Maybe all the rulers are wrong. Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem. Oh, that is so unfortunate. Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight. You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone. Bye-bye! That’s why I moved out. I think on some levels she already knows. Okay, well maybe not on those levels. Why, nobody good? Oh, really? So what are they doing? Hey, you’re early. I’m just taking it to be re-wired. No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here. You don’t play the oboe! Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. Huh? It’s not in the apartment? Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again. Okay, enough with the third degree! II’ve, I don’t live here anymore. I’m sorry, IIII don’t live here anymore. II didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows! That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions. Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side. Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. II need to live in a land where people can spill. Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening. Aww, good. What?

Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay. I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom? I am soo dead. Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom! I know, you must've won like a contest or something! I'm sorry, okay, II wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it. When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open! It's Monica's bed. What? So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you? Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay. No, no, it's just my tooth. No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him. Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'. Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives! Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead. Ow! Ow! All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set. Although, don't feel like you can't visit. Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him. Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or. All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um. No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive! Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know. 'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!' Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone! WooHoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive. What? Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big. I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick. He's alive! He's a-live! 'Love.' 'I know.' 'I've found.' Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever. Yay! Okay, so how do we decide that? Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle. Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler? Yeah. What's block? I thought you meant in life. Go! Go! Go! Oh I got it! Oh! Ew!

Do you think we should bring them some? Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now. No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night? Really? Hey. Well, II thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh. Destiny. Yes. Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled. You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist. So, what happens to the old guys? Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey. Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh. All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard. Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that. This is the worst Christmas ever. Oh! Oh my God! You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best! Oh, God bless us, everyone. Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?' Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down. Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired. Oh, thank you. Well, he's very charming. Well, you're just gonna have to try. Hey! Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice. Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you. Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents. Why, what happened? How can you not know which one? We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha! Oh well y'know. Ick, you were eavesdropping. Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me. Thanks you guys! Thank you. God, I hope they kick his ass! Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles. Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it. A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich'. Why don't you get a magician?! Well, can you dance at all? What, what is that? Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita? Oh yeah. Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! Hey! What are you wrapping? Yeah, it's a vase. Well not exactly like the one in the poem. Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. Hi. Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff. I'm going to let him. Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger. Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. You've have lipstick right here. That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed. I'll have coffee. Hey!

No, I can spot you from here. Okay, listen Robert. Umm, I think you're really, really great. IIIII don't know, I don't know what to say. Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done. Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs. Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here? Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles. Hmm, bummer. No. But thanks. Okay. No. But thanks. Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please? Where's Chandler? Oh. Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie! Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together. You never run on a barge! Oh my God! You threw Pepper on the fire! It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know. You think you know me so well. Yeah. That's what I said. I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives. I stepped in something icky. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault. Oh, yeah! I, a jingle? No, no-no-no, no. Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up. Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you? Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay. No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it. Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be? Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song? Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far. Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas! I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is. Oh! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace. Ick-neck-tree-anis. There's a 'g' in there. In your atlas! Oh. Oh. Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me. What is this? Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here. Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you! Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over. Oh. See there it is right there. Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it. Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way. Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute. Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry! Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times. You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali. Interesting. Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit. Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing? Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other. That would be great. Thank you. Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it. Well, tell him, apology accepted. Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner? Plate! Yes, plate. See, we don't need them. Yeah. Ameri-can. Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again. Hey! Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?

Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else. Whoa! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow. Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy. Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.

No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat! But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics. Yes. Not out loud. Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it. Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?! Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. You’re Frank’s best man?! Well then, what about you?! Huh?! Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks.

Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. We were out of Doritos. Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out. What, so what are you gonna tell him? Huh. Wow.

He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me. Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal. Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and, Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so’s Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So, It’s really just about the math. Jason? Nah-ha!

Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date? Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it. You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald. Great! Okay, good for you! Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. Well I hope you have fun tonight. Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now. I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people. Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay. Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality. Oh no, Bonnie’s the best! So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie? Ohh, that’s too bad! Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea. Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain? No! No! Look at that! It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team! Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go. Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive. You said it was okay! What?! What-what-what-what-what?! Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross? Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy? So? Oh no. Oh, we killed them all. Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it? Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look. Y'know what that means?

She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look! Isn't this what he would look like now? I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored? All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it. Okay. Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this. Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited. Come on, take 'em off! Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep. After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm. She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me! Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.

I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right? Ross, how many parents have you lost? Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive. Okay. I think she would like that. Thank you. We both forgive you. Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime. Come on, Mom, I'll take you home. How come? Okay, I didn’t hear that. Wow!

Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica. Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, Yeah, he pulled a Monica. Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica. Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, Yeah, that one’s outta here. Though some things don’t change. Wow! My breasts are really strong. They’re not even touching the lasagna! Oh, they love your casserole. It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.

I justI just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y know? II started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It s been a really bad day, whore wise. Yeah, they thought I was a whore. Great! Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh. But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh? Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smellycat, smelly- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey. My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey. It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters. Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy. So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that Woo-hoo thing. Hey. Hi. Wow, cute one! Yeah, I should go to, cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes-eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm! Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common. What?! Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her! You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that! Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket. Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just, noodle water. Sure. But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice. It's okay. How's the soup? Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice? Gunther, kiss me. And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies. Hey what are you guys looking at? Yeah, come to papa. Oo! Is it for my birthday present? Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet? 'Kay.

You sound like Monican't, not Monican. Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not? There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving! Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.

Oo, sorry I acted like a bank. Yes. Did you settle the bill? Oh, look what we almost left. Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took! But Mon, you have to get our money! I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was? Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, that massage wasn't long enough, or, I don't recognize any of those songs, or, you know, these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl! Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill. She seems fine now. You didn't get the money, did you? No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow? Okay, Widow! Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go. Good. Uh, yay! Yeah. I'm a hard ass. Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime! Okay! Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties! Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe? Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease. Darn it! Now, I don t know who to get to the next verse. Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about bah-bah-bha-bhan? Oh yeah, that s right, the keyboards, huh? I wanna hear The Sound.

Oh no. No-no-no, don t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music. Does Joey know? I think maybe, yeah. Yeah! No, that s right. And I thought it was a really good idea. Oh my God, he s lost it. He s totally lost it. After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help. Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving! Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who. I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh! Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade! Ohh. You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want. God, what happened?! Open it up, let me see. Ooh, God it looks bad. Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number? Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor? Yes! She's very excited about that. This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. Okay, get out of my kitchen! All right I. I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted. Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, That's not how your dad used to do it. Oh, I'll get it. Oh, he-he can't talk right now. He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him. They were threefold. Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging! Oh, there they are! All right, get a room. Okay! Okayyyyy, open up! Yeah, it's for our catering business! No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette. And also, we don't know what to do with this. Oh sure, Cilantro Larry. How could you say yes, what about our catering business? Oh, in that case, Yay! That was me hopping on board. Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy? Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm. Oh, okay! Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head. Wow! You really laid into this place. Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering. No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed? Yeah, all right. Bye! Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go. Hey, Monica! Hey! Yeah. I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and You got the job! Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception. But we've only had one job. Yeah! What are you saying? What? You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money! For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here. Okay, I'm hearing. What?! I waI waI wa. Monica! No. No. Really?! Are you sure? Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job. Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy. Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new ATeam. Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. Where were you? Oh, which museum? No, answer his. Umm, that paper's two weeks old. What's wrong Mon? Oh. Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.' Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it? Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel! Oh, yay! I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name! All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme? Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph? You work with robots! No! No, the robots just work for them. If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all? Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant? Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry. What? So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God! So, did you pick one yet? Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done! Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague. There's sooo much you don't know. Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. ' Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. ' Said all you need is to write them a song. ' They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. ' No, don't sing along. My little brother is married! You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping? Wait, wait. Why were you at the courthouse? Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too! Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't! So, ooh, I'm going to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need? That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat. Hey! Guess what? Frank Jr. and Alice got married. And they're going to have a baby! Yeah! And they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. Yeah. Eww! And no, no! They want me to be the surrogate. It's her egg and his sperm. I'm just the oven. It's totally their bun. Well, they said I had to think about it first. But what is there to think of? I'm going to be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give. I know. Yeah, what's your point? You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture. My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did! Hi. Sorry I'm late. Wow, you really go all out for company. Oh, OH! Oh, I didn't know you did pot. Oh, ooh! Erotery! Okay. Why not? Oh, I understand. Don't, don't hurt the puppy. Oh, I get a puppy? Why? Okay. Mom: I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first. All right, it's okay. Oh, you know what? I think it's time for the puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go on the balcony. Uh, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Oh, listen, don't go on the balcony until I get back. My mom's going to be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes, no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No. My mom was right. If I can't give him up, there's no way I can give up a little baby. Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed. What, what else can I give them? A kidney? Okay. Hey, why don't you? Uh-huh, yeah! No, I'm really okay with this. You know why? Cause look at them. Look how happy there are. And I made that. I know it's going to be like a million times harder to give up a baby but oh my God!

Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor? Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it. II can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake, ooh! Cake! No. God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good? No! Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat! Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous. Being pregnant is tough on your tummy. That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too. Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that? Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami? Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius. Oh my God! The baby just kicked! Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder. I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat. Yeah, totally! Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows. What? Yeah. Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me. Pastrami. Okay. Six months. Not if I get there first. Hi! Yeah. Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. You mean like a doctor? Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OBGYN today. Oh my God! Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay? Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one! Well, yeah. Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! So II mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out! What do you know?! Ooh! Hi! Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, Oh, that’s nice? Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies. Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked. No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and. No, back to happy. Back to happy! No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really? You can’t give up on your dream. Hey. Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me. Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay. Hi! Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking. No! No! No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan. My Saturn dealership. OohOoh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school! I’m telling it! I’m telling it! Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got? No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s. The name was my favourite part! YOU DID NOT! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good. Hey, tell him about RelaxiTaxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab. Oh, that is better. Hey! Ha-ha. No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I - my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool! Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour! Hey! What are you doing here? Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus. Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar. Hi! Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon. No, I’mI’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with The. Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don’t, maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk. God, Susan is so fun! Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross. No! No! II meant for the baby! Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never happen to like The Hulk, y’know. So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler. Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey? All right, so, what are we supposed to call you? Umm, Gene. Bye, Gene. Oh my God! Wow, Carol really messed you up! Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right. All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city! Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t. Drum roll. You’re actually going through with this? You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact, yes, I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’mI’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler. Yeah, but you have to keep the name too! Okay! Yeah! Yay! Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now! Ooh, uh. Okay, bye! Hello! Excuse me. Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable! What? Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh. I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know. You’re clothes aren’t funny. Boy! I didn’t see that coming! That’s too hard. Too hard! Hey, so? Are you gonna do it? Or you could end up with everything. Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet? Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh, oh, I have a game! This is great! Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name, oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees? Good! Good! Five points! All right, Joey, same question. Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy. Oh, I have cards! Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay. What make you think I can?! I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha! I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it. That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all. Okay, scarf’s done. Hey! What? Oh, are you pregnant too?! Hey! Oh, the Olympics. I still cannot believe you’re engaged! Just ‘cause its happening so fast not ‘cause you’re such a loser. Already?! Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.

I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life. I guess. Oh my God! Oh, you’re such a cheater! Hey! Oh, how’d that happen? What is that? Oh, how did it go? What did he say? Yeah, maybe. Any luck? Hey, y’know what might cheer you up? No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride! Not after this! Hey! What-what’s up? Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like 60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die! So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me? Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine! Hey!

I haven't really had any yet. Stop it! One of the babies is kicking. It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh. Hey! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo! What are you doing?! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie! Hi! And you're going into what grade? Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor. Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go! They are. Why? Happy birthday! I know, it is. Can I tell you a little secret? I want to keep one. Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know! Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, II hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know? Oh, just ask him! I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out! You're right. Tell him it's for you. So did you ask him? Well, I'm kinda on a clock here. Undo it. Undo it. Undo it. Hi! Okay, doctor says any minute now. Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do. Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh! What is that? Oh my God! I already had a baby. Leave me alone. Which one do you have? But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know. Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies. So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry. I know. Yeah. You won't be able to take it. They're gonna call her Chandler. Works on you. Ugh, PBS! Ugh, what's right with them? Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back. All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys! This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish. What-what are you talking about?! Yeah. So? Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless. Yeah, it's. Y'know there's no you may not! Are you calling me selfish?! I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant? Right. I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass! I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right! Ooh-ohh! Why? Yeah. Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life. Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me. Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not. Aw, dammit! Ooh, it's not a toy. Hi Joey. I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate 200. Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed. No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster. Yeah, not the one I had my eye on. Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel, Oh no! Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there! Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore? Yeah that's better than my way. Can you hear anything? Ooh, Madlibs, mine! I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better. Hey. Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though. Ehh! Come where? Okay, but try and get Joey too. Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever. Hey! Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention. We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey! The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, Hi, Phoebe! Count for what? Hey! Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud. Eeeee-ohh! God! Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make! Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green. Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing. I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat. That might work! Why? Hey! So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies. This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do. Nooo! I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much. Oh, I know. All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I, it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine! Are you still mad at us? Oh good! Because we have an I'm sorry song. You're kinda stepping on the song. Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! Yes! Exactly! And that's why. Okay, let's get some perspective people it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat! Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard! Hi Emily! Here. Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold! Umm, do health inspectors work on commission? It's okay to laugh right? Okay. Yum-my! Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors. Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show! Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda. Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat. Okay. He's so funny! Show me the badge again. Shiny. You are just nonstop! Why?! You have the power to do that? Shut it down. Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down! Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, See you ladle. Ooh, absolutely! Ooh, I love that place! So, no. Enh. Sure! Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go! Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever? Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose. Does anyone wanna watch TV? Monica your remote doesn't work. Oh. Aw, forget it. Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything. I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse. Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse! Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse. Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new. Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head! Hello? Joey? What's going on? Oh my God! Easy. Step. How did it get on? Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out! Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal. Hey! No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary. All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think. Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it? Oh, I can't believe you called her fat. Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story! Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever. What am I sitting on? Ew-eww! Undies! Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow. Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam. Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with! Yeah! Okay ooh, but are you going to have time to read it? This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish. Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street. Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop. Well, he stabbed me first! Okay. I thought you said you read it in high school. Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy moors in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism. You completely stole my answer! Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it! I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. Would you care to venture one? Are you just repeating what I'm saying? Okay then. Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?! Yeah? Hi! You didn't read this one either?! What? No! You should've read it yourself! Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg. Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time. Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights. I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop. Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously. Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school. All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert! What's going on? So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off. I don't know! I didn't come with her! Hey you guys, guess what? Ohh, you and your ways. Since it’s Christmas time. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations. Yeah, I already have my bell and later on. I get my bucket. Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city. Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing Merry Christmas in 25 languages. I lied. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. Hey! Well, it's going okay. Oh, thanks! Wow! Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive. Just get your nails done? Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. Thank you! And Happy Holidays. Wait, you can't take the money out. But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor. Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still. Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just. Thank you, Happy Holidays. Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't. Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash! Hey! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning! Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here. Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you? Does it look like an ashtray? Does it look like a urinal? Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket! Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back, because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here! What?! That chick can't handle my corner. Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask? You too! Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet. Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane. Really?! How come? Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher. Well, I taught me and I love me. Hey! Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you. Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here. Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, III made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all. Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?! Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar? Then don't touch one! Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg! Joseph, did you even study at all last night? Then do Iceberg! G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God! No, but you're questioning my method! Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid. Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder! Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown! Oh, fine! Take his side! No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages! Uh-huh! No! Yeah! Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended. Bye! Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So. That's weird. I bet they're doing it. Hey! Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase? Exactly! Because it's in the past! Okay, then what happened? Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn! Nothing! This is not over! What?! Hey! What were you doing? Oh, nobody's judging you. You two will have very hairy children. So are you actually gonna see her again? Uh-hmm. Get your foot off my contestant! Judge! Ohhh. Hey! Are you serious?! You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We. No! Hey-hey that's not a NutterButter, that's just an old Wonton! Ohh, tough call. Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital. Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died. It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit. Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse! It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins. Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again. It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter. And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter. It's Phoebe. Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in? Umm, well, umm Grandma died. No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow. No you didn't! Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not? Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on. Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag! Thanks! Yeah, welcome. Umm here's your 3D glasses. So how did you know Francis? Really?! What's your name? You're Frank Buffay? You just said. But. Oh my God! That was my dad! Uh-huh. He said, Nice to meet you Glenda. Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name? Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned! Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later. All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma. All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad. Umm, no, not at first 'cause II don't want to freak him out. Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it. All right. Oh! Get off! Ow! Oh, stop it! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?! As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone! He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain! Umm, thank you for meeting with me. Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just. I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay. Okay. Huh? Oh yes. Yes. Yeah no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick. Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1 You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct? Okay, umm, question 2 Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children? Yeah. See? Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man? What?! But you-you-you came to see Lilly? Lilly's dead. She's dead. Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake. 17 years ago. Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch. Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you! Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there. Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go. That's a defense? You make up songs? Well, I am. Not yet, no. Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes! It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it. Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh! Ahhh! Chandler and Monica! Chandler and Monica! CHANDLER AND MONICA! OH! MY EYES! MY EYES! NO! THEY'RE DOING IT! YOU KNOW?! Get in here! You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or. Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp! Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better. Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows? Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own. Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do. No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know! Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate. And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality. Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie. Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you! Yeah the material feels so soft hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out? Well, if you really wanna know, I'm. Oh! I can't tell you this. Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most. I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee. Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will. I have quarters! But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send? Bye Chandler! I miss you already. Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment? He broke that. I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out. Oh? Hello you. Eh? Really? I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more! No! God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything! All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in. Please. So Chandler, II'd love to come by tonight. Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven? Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse. Okay, Rachel, get me perfume! And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? Okay. Good idea! Oh now, don't give away the farm! Chandler. I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some? So, here we are. Nervous? No, I want this to happen. Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off! Really? No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me. He's not backing down. He went to get lotion. Joey! Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons. Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra. You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now. Ooh. Here it comes. Our first kiss. And why not?! You're-you're what?! I just. I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love! God! Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything. Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts. Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor. Bread, so you never go hungry. And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know. Yeah! Mr. President. Yeah. I really like his glasses. Oh, hi Ross! Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be. No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's-I'm a hit! Hey! Yeah, okay, my bad. That's what I'm saying. Ooh. No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay? Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy. But somehow you came off as the bad guy. Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there. Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already! All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, Who hear likes Ross, and he's wearing two nametags! II'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean. Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero. Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week. All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need? Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge! Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am? You can't put your cigarette out on a tree! No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again. Hold it! N. Y. P. D! Freeze punk! Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em. Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree. You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup! Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup! so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool! I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds. You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. Hey. Excuse me, is this your car? Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. II'm with the umm, the 57th. I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore. Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz? Yeah, big guy, kinda bald. Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died. II sure will, take care. Oh. Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me! Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it! Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool! I would love it if I weren't here! Me?! Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out! Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer. Gary. Yeah! So-ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me? Ohh, impressive. Yeah, we'll talk at dinner. All right, I can't wait! Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it! You wanna work on your interview skills? Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi. Very good handshake, good wrist action. Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler. But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk. Okay, then maybe I can come too! All right, you go. 'Kay, bye! Oh God! Oh I just miss him so much! Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other. So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler? Come on, seriously! When did it end? Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious. God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just. I misspoke. It's okay. Oh we can't, we already have plans. Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie. You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go? Yeah! You tired Chandler? Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here. We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code! What are you talking about?! Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend. Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise. Okay, great so do you want to do it together? Hey! Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee? Oh good! Oh good. Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! Oh, look at that. What happened to the intimate dinner party? So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host. Like what? Cups? You're giving me cups? Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice! I got it! Mine! Hey! Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party? Umm, cups. Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice. Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey! Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical! Oh, look! Look! Look! I was in charge of cups. I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law? Don't get me started on that. Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl. Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian! See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone. This is so cool! But I like it here! Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them. Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed. I guess so. Wait, Rach! Where's the other one? Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?! Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight! These are her earrings. Why not? I found it! On your dresser. Maybe your scene's coming up? This is terrible, what are you going to do? That's not good. But I already gave them back to you! All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring? Make sure you check Chandler's jewelery box. Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?! Why are you being weird? No, that would be, Why are you being cute? Ohh! I did not get that. Did you find it? Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me. What are we going to do?! All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all. I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault. Mon, can I talk to you for a sec? Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry! I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible. No. Yeah! You're the best! Oh, right! III found it interesting. Ross? What else do they add smell too? Oh no! I am definitely gonna watch that! Definitely! Oh, then no. Hey! Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes. Uh-huh! John Glenn is here?! Hi! My God, Joey! Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you. Okay! Bye! Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story. Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey. I'm fine, thanks. Nope. Okay. Bye! So, what movie should we see? What?! Really?! I can't believe this! No, but it is fast. Isn't it? No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this! I don't know. I'll just handle it. I'll ask you to talk to him! Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man! Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing? What?! You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God! Ohh! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing. Yeah! Okay. Thanks! Okay. Yeah? Uh-hmm. No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. Yeah? That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other. I just. I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for. I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just. I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake. Which is why my answer is yes! Uh-huh! I'm so happy. We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay! I know, I'm so excited! Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited! Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in! I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps. No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they? Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out. No, nothing. Yeah. No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. Uh-huh! Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together. Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water? Umm, yeah! Today's. Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging! Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry! Yeah? That's so sweet. Living with you would make me happy. No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you! Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never! I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day. We could have breakfast in bed. Okay. Oh! Oh no. Oh good, you're all up. Oh yeah, that's over. He shot a bird! Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright. Nah, I don't feel like playing. Yeah! Ohh, give him a kiss for me! Bye! I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him! I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons! Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay? You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way? Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, Ross on it. Ohh-oh, chilling! Oh wait, my grandmother's dead. No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it you can drive it to Las Vegas. Oh hey Joey! What's up? Yeah, I've been around. Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe. Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can. Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites? Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer? Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot? North route or south route? Bamn! There you go! Huh? Oh, this guy again. Umm, no thank you. Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind! Bye! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. Well, if you don't know I can't help you. Well, I can't help you. Apology accepted. Uh-huh. Bye, fat ass. I don't know! I don't remember! Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. No. No that made me feel precious. That game should not be played without my supervision. What's in the bag? I do! Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel! Hey, dude! Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering. Okay, I guess he ran out of change. No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison. Uh-hmm. Fauna. Garfunkle. You said I was boring-Ohh! Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess! Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream. Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie? Okay! Hello? Hey Joey! Sure! Where is it? Ohh! So you're 5639?! Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler? Who was that? Yeah! Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica? It's okay. What the hell took you so long? Which Richard? Richard Simmons?! Oh my God! Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it? That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard. But again, Simmons. Go on. Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler? Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year! Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks! On a totally different bet. Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler. Okay, I'm gonna go too! Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London. Uh-huh, great story! I'm going! Hey! Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me! You wanna go?! Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me! Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked. Naked alone time. Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door? So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London? Okay, what about after I give you these candies? Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing. Oh no. Simmons! Go with Simmons! Okay, London 1. Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh! For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi! Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey! Wow! Why are you dressed as a gladiator? So you're a gladiator! Wow! Monica had lunch with Richard. Noo! But that would've been so cool! I love Vegas! Thanks. Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry. So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him. Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one! Hey! Yeah? Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up? But she just came up here! I wonder where she is. That is so weird. Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you! Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her. Good. I should really start wearing hats! Hey! You guys are here! Yay! What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget. Yeah! Whoa, what kind of party was this? Ugh! That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing. MMMole people? Oh. What's a lurker? Kills you? Ohhh! How do you know about this? Dance karate? Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get! Ohh! You made up! Ohh, get a room. I know. Use it. Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside! Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over! Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave? What time? Maybe we can share a cab! I won! I won! I finally won! Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! Sells drugs to kids. She sells drugs to kids. How about we talk about this over dinner? No! No, you can't arrest me! No! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole! Oh, okay. Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-fax? I must've left it in conference room B. Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world. No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange! Okay! Okay! Okay! Hey! Don’t you give me any of your. Hey! Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you run in the chapel! What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage. Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas. Really?! Oh my God! Eh! Well. Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast? What about my cab? No, Joey! You borrowed my cab you have to drive it back. I don’t know, it’s such a long trip. Are you asking me to have a frenaissance? All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you. Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message they should be here any minute. Well you don’t. Good! Good! I was just testing you. No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable. Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch. Hell, I’m drunk right now! What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation! Oh-oh, that’s your thing. You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced. Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I’m so drunk. Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any QUESTIONS! Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper! Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice. Sing! How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something! Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?! Do you like car games? I love the license plate game! NoNo! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! Oh, okay. And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court. Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice! You can still sleep at night and stuff. Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich? Is it a meatball sub? No thanks, I’ve already seen one. Always. What?! Always. What?! Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second? Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. Oh, the Angelica! Go! Go! You didn’t get the annulment?! Ross?! Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive. So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?! Op, woman! Sorry. Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay! Hey Rach! Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie? Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! Hey! No, why? You’re pregnant! Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe. Guys, I’m happy too. Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled. Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel. Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?! Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates. Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces! Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here. Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him? Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him? Okay, what about you? Wouldn’t you want a date? Whatever! What about you Meg? She said, He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her. Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani! Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, Well done! Bravo Meg. Okay, bye! So? Did you get the annulment? I knew it! Because you love Rachel. Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love. I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her. Oh we do, but not just yet. Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out. I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids. But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem. I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him. Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! Uh-huh, what? Oh! Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise? My roommate. Yes, Denise. Denise! Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE! Hey. So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? You didn’t tell her did you? Of course not, because you’re in love with her. What do you mean, comforted her? Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug! Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair? Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist. Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are. Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love! Shhh! I’m swamped right now. Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. It worked! Wait, no, look at this! Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay! Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor. I saw it. Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again you re-love her! I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid. What?! Wow! I’mI’m so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid. No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! Okay, that’s a lie. I found you in my bed! How’d you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair. Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. Yes. Ross, I know what you’re thinking. That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad. What?! No! Yeah, Professor and Mrs. Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married. Just kidding! Saved your ass. Hi. Well, you know that psychic I see? Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that. Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get. I don’t, she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black. No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!, leans back, and starts reading. Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me. Hey! Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could. I was preparing you for my, didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off? Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can. Hey! What’s going on? Hey! Maybe you’ll die! No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday. No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys! Hey! Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die! Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong! Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies! Have you really done this before? Hey! We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back. Oh my God! Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core! Another lie. You have a sickness! Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?! Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya! Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself! What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate. Maybe you could be my roommate! Yeah! Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th. I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast? Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered. Hey! I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy. No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up. What?! Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep. Oh, I can still do that. How did that happen?! Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting! But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me! But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years. I’m pretty sure it’s gun. A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do? Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, Yeah, I do! Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now who aren’t there! How do you feel? Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed. I know, the babies are asleep. I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself! So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? Well, how much do you think he needs? Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. And also, my birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you. Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that. I have plans. That’s right. Okay. Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time. You don’t remember? Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss. Come on, there’s gotta be something. Good! Great! You can go first. Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better? Great! It worked! No one’s sad. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? Hey! I call her! Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her! I know, I took it hard too. Hey, how are you guys doing? Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys. STOP! I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down. Well, deep-deep-deep down! Then keep running. Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore. You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! What else? That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun! Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that? Ready? Okay. it's. and. please. leave. Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get it’s, and oh I'm sorry, I have A. Forget it. All right, so let's switch. Okay. Hi! It's, and. Please wait, how did you do that? Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you? Really? Okay, let's go running! Let's run towards them! All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks! Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green. I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up. Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go! Hey! Why? Why would you do that? Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself. Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. Sure. So, what should you have done? UhHuh, Which is? So? Why do you care? But people that you don't know and will never see again. Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss. But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight. That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbour's dog. Hey! See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone! Hey. Rachel? I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine. Oh my God. What happened? Well that’s great! Congratulations! You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you. Thank you. Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in. Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser. Totally. Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know. No! What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? No, yeah, I should. Hey. Here. Ohh, who’s the silver fox? That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though. Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack. What? Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren? Ohhh. Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH! Demon! Demon! But why didn’t you just tell her the truth. Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that? Just for a second. Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, sleep with Kenny. Ohh, yes it would. Hey! Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is, so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else! And who else is going to be there? Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy. Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night. Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad, and now he’s he’s. Jack Geller, dream hunk. Rachel? Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of condensed milk. Monica, leave him alone! So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it? Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant? I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. Ohhh no. Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack. I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl. Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen. Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman. I love Jacques Cousteau! That is nice and we’re done. TADA! Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you. No-no, we do it every year! No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx. But we have to! Well then, you should look with us. Oh, that’s it? A great idea! Ooh ooh, we have a live one! Ooh, who’s it for? Uh-oh. She may be onto us. Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap! Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great! Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz. Hey! Look who I found! Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. Or we could just follow your clever jokes, any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are! Hmm, how about my azzz? What? No, don’t look directly at them! Alright, no, we could look at them! Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here. And the big one’s for me! Hee hee! Will you get us better gifts? Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless. She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen. Yeah well, we’ll see. Hey! Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it? Umm, a flea market? Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions. Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium. How much was it? 500 bucks at a flea market?! Oh no. A dollar? Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing. Well, what period is it from? Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or. White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place. Hey! Okay. Hey! Ooh, cool sheets! Sure! You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little. Oh sure! Noo! What?! Ross, where did you get this?! Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars! Well this doesn’t even smell like opium. Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents. Hey! Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that. Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too! Ah! Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate. And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help. Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk. No! I do want to! Yeah! Well at least I got these sheets for Ross. Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck! No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us! That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the. wait a sec! This is our exact living room! Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God! No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp! I can’t! I can’t! Unless. Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp? But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp? Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp! But at least the apothecary table is real. I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes. Hey. Wh-wh-what are you doing? Oh, I want to look too! Yikes! Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? Rachel. I don’t know. Me neither. I guess it was kinda funny. Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re, just kinda high maintenance, okay let’s go to lunch! No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all. Ya, you know, Rachel, she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her. Oh, okay, you’re not a pushover. Okay. That true, I am flaky. Yeah, totally. That’s great. Good for you guys. Who said you were? Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything. Really? I’ve heard better. Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive. Wow! That is a bad audition. Rach, you’re in my seat. Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend. Yeah, well, I kinda thought. Yeah Joey that is so gross! I’m pretty. Oh I do! Oh, y’know what? No. Wait a second. I know it’s in here somewhere. Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter? Never mind, I got it. Of course, yeah! Ooh, I like cards. Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea. I would love that job! Sorry Jill. Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y’know I want a job sweater. And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants. Yeah, you never heard of them? What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I? Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it! Hey. Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know. No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them. Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there. Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Okay then. But great news about the apartment pants, huh? Yeah me too. Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that. All right, what’s going on there? Oh Chandler! So that story doesn’t make you cry? Yeah? Yeah. Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah! You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He’s a fan. Bye! Hey! What’s up? Oh my God! What am I doing?! It’s Phoebe! Phoebe! Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies. You’re making one right now! And-and you’re using my name! Look, I’m talking right now! You’re you mean her. What?! No! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you with that! Hey! So, I just came from the company Ursula works for. No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks there were a lot of them. Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address. Oh no! No! I know how to handle it. Yeah. You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See? Wow! No! Barry and Mindy. Which time? What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch? Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks. Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. Hey! What? Ohh that’s so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnn! Go! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired. Hi! Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go! Who’s this? Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I. Whatever. Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name. No-no! No! No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars. What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts. My chest hurts! Oh, and now II can’t breathe. Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm? Then yes that is what I’m having. Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan. So what’s going on with you? Still going through that dry spell with Carol? How long has it been since you had sex? Oh that’s not so bad. That is. Maybe you need to spice things up a little. I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up you could eat stuff off each other. Y’know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys. Roll playing. You could be the warden she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate she could be the wench! Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! It never happened. Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects. No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me! Okay! Okay! I’m so glad you’re here. Oh, give it to me. Give it! Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?! Thank God. Hey. Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy! What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea! What are you two girls whispering about over there?! Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do? Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother! Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?! I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon. No. I’ve learned my lesson. Let’s go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. Surprise! Look who’s back! Hey! Uh, I don’t think so! Jack! Hey! All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh? Nu-uh! Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count. Anyway, I’ll be in my office. That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake. Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that. Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding! I’m having another heart attack! I’m having another heart attack! Call 9-1-1! Dumbass! Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack. Yeah. Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this goin’ on. Wow! I still have it! Hey! Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today! Now, we can kick anybody’s ass! Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel! Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is. You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? No. Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea! You guys! Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make? What is that? Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud! Now, it’s you little bunny friend. Ross! Ohh, you’re a freak! Pat Sajak? Alex Trebek? Chuck Woolery? Say we are unagi! No Rachel! They got here first! Why is Ross doing that? We should help him! What’s a Movement class? Oh my God! How bad was it? Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through! Oh! Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying! No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now. Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house! Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here. Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room. What’s that smell? So did you sleep well last night? Yeah? Y’know what Joey left on my pillow? Gum! Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle! I don’t use a curling iron. Thanks Monica! What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here. I can smell it a little, bake the pie. Okay. Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?! Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes. Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips. Okay. Okay, I’ll be out in a second. That doesn’t lock does it? Hey! Hi! Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you! Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but II had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s. Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you. Yeah she said something about crumbies. Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy! No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink! All right fine! This looks like so much fun. God, what a mess. Well, what kind of guy are you looking for? Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together? Oh, sly. Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12? Hey! Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing. Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo. ‘Cause that’s just your taste. Oh yeah? My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these. A chin dimple! Have you seen your guy’s body? Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it. Oh yeah, like there are police for that! I know. Oh, Chandler funny? My guy is well read. My guy has great teeth! Hey! What did you do on yours? Rachel, what the hell is this?! You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own! Yeah and II found you one too who is not a weirdo. So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work? No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people. Well, so do a lot of people. Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance? Uhh, okay. I gotta go! Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy. Okay sure! Ooh, technically you owe me 600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions. Okay. Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating. Nothing, you just have to be cool with it. This is Patrick. Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late they’re sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel? This is Patrick. Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about. Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it. Yeah? Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. Have a seat. Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money. Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out. Then why did she ask us to. Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you. Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth! You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself! Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine! Oh my God. I am extremely talented! No, I mean I was really acting my ass off. Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me. Fine! I’ll do it without you! I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! You’ll see! You’ll all see! I am. Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuck! Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until. And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it! It's not that bad. Chandler, Chandler. Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this! Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts! OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass. I know! I know! I know! Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. There we go. You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you! I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, Ooh, where’d Ross go? Yeah? He’s holding us back. No! Joey, you’re going to be great! I’ll be waiting. No, I’m just deciding which one to use. I’m gonna start writing another book! Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut. I want to see what he wants first. You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness. Yeah. Not looking for dates. You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower? Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great! And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment. Hey! Well, why don’t you just get him fired? You wish. I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people. Marcia and Chester. I see what you’re doing! Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter! Hi! I know what time you said. Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said. Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up. I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. Thanks! So are you. Mon. Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven. That’s right. Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis. Hi, you guys. Well it’s just, it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the HelmetPelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum. No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us! Okay that’s so generous! Great! Okay then it’s just us girls! Yeah. It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek! Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know we’d be great together! So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet? Hey, and then lunch. Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay? No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right? Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. Me too! I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know? Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay. Don’t even get me started on yours! Yeah? No! Why? Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God! What are you gonna do? Rachel said that! Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, Son of a bitch? Okay, maybe ask this guy. Well, what did he do? Joey! Well, we should go. Hey, did she buy it? So did Heldi show you the place? I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you! Now, have you told anyone else? You told me. Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet. Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? Yeah, coffeehouse. So how are things going with Paul? That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open. No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone. Watch this. Hi Paul! So how are things going with you? Yeah! That was so weird, huh? I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s. He’s mad at you! Please, I think you know why. Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper. Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for? Well then I think that’s it. Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table. Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or, ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! Picks one up from the display in the corner. Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry? Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out. Or not, whatever. Chandler, II will handle this! How much is it? We will give you 10. We stand firm at 10. Okay. Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything here for 10. I’ll give you 1 for them. Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much? Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something’s missing. It’s not. Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out. Oh my God! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! Chandler, I found the perfect ring. Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over! Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail! The little jail between the doors! I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring. Maybe it was the guy. Hey. It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring! Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something. Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring. There he is! Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes. Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call. It is your office. John? Here he is. Wow! I would trade. Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart? Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity. Hi. What? Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring. Yeah! If she says no, can I have the ring? If! Hi Monica. It’s gone. We’re practically kissing. Open bar? I can do that for the kids. Y’know, you are 12 years older than her. Oh! Oop! Here. So now what’s going on here? No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair? No! It’s nice! Oh, hi. Hey you guys! Look! I got me some drinks! Open bar! You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you? Forget her! You enjoy this! Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute. Well, just buy the damn boat! I’m just helping the kids! Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. Oh, okay. It’s a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table? Oh, enchantée. Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out. What happened? Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor. Good one! Yeah. Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track. Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward! No, you’re too late! She already took out the trash! I know, they’re gonna be so happy together. Not that often! Me too! So happy for them! Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous! Totally. I’m like 90 10. Definitely! What do you mean? You mean a backup? Yeah, yeah I got that. Hm-mmm. Joey. Yeah! Yeah, I locked him years ago! Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were. Well hey, it’s just a backup. Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler! I don’t. Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation! Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married! All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat. This is hard! No wait! Just. Okay Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week. I’m talking about massages. Good! Left! Thank you. Ross! Yeah absolutely! Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here! Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet. So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical. Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment? Oh, 19! We thought you said 90! Oh honey no, you ate it all. Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay. I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit. Okay. You guys kissed! What does this mean?! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding? What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed. Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem. Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s, maybe no more for you though. Why?! Yeah? Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding. Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away. Would she? Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit. Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date. Oh, I see. Y’know, I don’t really need their permission. Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you. You gotta do something about your eyes. They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes. Maybe just 10 minutes for you. Oh thank you. Now. Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer. Oh oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning. It starts? That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now. Hey! Ross! I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler. Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days? Nothing. Why?! Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes. Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies? Oh Ross, hi. I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now. Okay, let’s talk outside. What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s! Okay, well Ross, what is this really about? Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is! My God! What did you order?! Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself? Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler. Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with. Ross! How could you do that to an old man?! My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon. He said you poked at him with wooden spoons. Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week! Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back! So what do you guys want for an engagement present? Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist. You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe? You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family? Break my heart. Oh, all right. If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it? Your own boat? I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up! Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present. Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left. Why not? Really?! You do? That and arrogance. I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage. Come on, it’s not that big a deal! Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale? Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those. Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now. Oh yeah. No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure. Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032. That’s what you think. Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse. Nesele Toulouse. Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language. Yes! Ohh. I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell! I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him. Uh-huh, yeah that’s right. What? You mean behind my back? Oh God! Oh hey! Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye. Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified. Let’s see. Oh my God! Oh. But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that, it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks. Hey. Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out? Sorry. What happened? You! An actor?! That’s madness! Hi! You must be Hilda. Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number. So you hired yourself a little treat did ya? But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant. Oh Willie’s still alive! Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty. Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer. Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid. Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out! He is! But he’s getting divorced. Ross! Maybe you know him. You don’t have to be back for a half-hour! So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else? I’m having a really good time! Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend. Yeah, I. Well y’know II mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost. Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go. Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross? Yeah, umm that’s Whitney, Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out? Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. Hi Ginger. I don’t have it! Ugh, okay Sherlock! All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex. Okay. Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her! Watching ballroom dancing? Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her. Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and. No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you! And! She uses sex as a weapon! You’re still gonna go out with her?! Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?! No listen to me! She is crazy! You see? Nothing is good enough for her! Hi. So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom. You think he’s emotionally unavailable? Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night! Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997. We want the last six years back! Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney? Oh he knows! For the most part. Both of you together? What about her whining and her constant need for attention?! Oh right, because you’re so capable of change. Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass. Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to. And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club! Potato, Potaato. Ooh, let’s see it! You guys make a very attractive couple. I hope it’s you. Yes! Oh! Still. Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours? Wh-why is that the best part? Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady! Hey Rachel? Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor? Uh-hmm. Oh! Well, if that’s what you want. But why does it even matter?! Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry! You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but II’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice! And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it. Oh, thank you so much! Okay. Oh I know. See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie! Na-uh, I am! Because I cared enough to lie! What are you talking about? Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it? Well, it’s better than us deciding. No! Coins hate me! Hey there, you handsome thing. Ugh, what a kiss ass. Yes! Your honor? Oh! Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?! Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. Really?! I won! The coins have finally forgiven me! Rach, it’s gonna be okay! You guys are the best! Hi! That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today. Oh yeah! Oh that’s so sweet thanks. Ohh. This stuff is great! Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor. Because I think it means more to you. It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? Man alive! Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor. Okay! And call me! We want you to marry her! She is so amazing! You have no idea. Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages. Yeah, but you always say that. Whatever. Secret affair! Oh. Hey! Oh no. Hey! Yay! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore? Didn’t you sleep together? Then change it back! No spark? Didn’t you sleep together? Does Joey have any idea? Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner. Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real. Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak. No, just a regular old flying dwarf. Hey! So how was, how was your date? Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you? Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her. Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery. Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that. Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk. Oh, it's not! It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good. Hi GellerBing residence. How can I help? I'm sorry, who's this? No, there's no dog here? Oh my god! Where are you? They're here already? How are they doing this? There's no dog in here. No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room. Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people? That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days. Are you crazy? Why? You don't like ice cream? All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. Oh, I'd say about a month. Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely. Yeah, okay. You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know. I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart. Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? Where's Chandler? Wash your hands! No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom. See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. Hey, is Chandler here? Okay, but you cannot tell him, but look whose back! Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. We have good news, look whose back! It's a Thanksgiving miracle! Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in. I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting! I never had a bike of my own. Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on. No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard. Not really, I got to drag him around too! Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it! Sure! Oh my God Ross! I love it! Ohh! Ohh! And I love you! Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer! Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten. Oh and Chandler’s about to cry. Oh hi! Ohh, uh-huh so much! Of course! Okay. See? Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat or a beanbag chair! Why? Why do I have to learn? What kind of an emergency? Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star. You won’t let go? Swear?! Okay. All right. Well. Okay. Okay. Weee! Oh! Oh! Oh no! You swore! I am shocked! Shocked! Oh, hello liar. I could’ve been killed I hope you know! Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. What?! What the hell?! What?! Why?! All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay. Okay Ross! Please don’t die! I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross. Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. Hey! Haaaa, ahhhh! Huh? Oh, yeah, it's my mom's. No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die. Oh, hey, you guys! Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out. Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. Yeah, why not? Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey? Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore? You're sure? You're absolutely sure? Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, Your mom probably won't kill herself, y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on Probably! Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing! So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay! That's fun. Hey! Hey! Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. Maybe on some level. Hey, Joey, I got you another present. It's a tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage? Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. Our apartment is ready. Because you would rather live here with Joey. Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that. Hm? Fish! Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here. We did have fun, didn't we? Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight. Yay, okay! Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop. Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore. Ooh! New sconces! What? Yeah? Yeah? Oh no! Oh! Wow! Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up. There’s a skylight?! Wow! Y’know I’mI’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that. A little bit, yeah. You heard her too?! You have the gift! Are you sure? Oh me too. No, I do not hear that. Oh. Oh. Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral? Absolutely! Okay. Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys. Duly noted. Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?! Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out. Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis! So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me! I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life! Well, it does. Okay, you wore me down. Oh my God! That’s David! David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David! Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around. David! What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia? Well. Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut? Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, of course I would want to see you. I. I think about you all the time. Really? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yes! Oh no! I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though? Uh-huh. Well, I have plans with Joey tonight. No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, II should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything! Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00! Hey! Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine. Okay. Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. Huh? Yeah, I’m very wise. I know. What? God Joey, this is taking forever! W-w. I just it’s that. I have y’know I haveI have an appointment. And it’s very important. Well. It’s a date. Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this. That. It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me. She was? Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him! Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Oh, I wouldn’t miss this. Oh, you’re such a gentleman. Come on! We’re going to my place! Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like. That’s really beautiful. What does it mean? That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else. You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it. I do too. Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow. No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never. I may never see him again. Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport. Well. But. Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing? Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s pretty amazing too. Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie! Shh! Get me out of here. Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can. Don’t interrupt me! Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do. Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?! Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch! Oh my God! How did you get back here?! Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer fireman, can-can I help you? That’s not mine. How do you know? Okay do you. Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America! Fine! But please God tell me how to stop them from going off! There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God! What? What happened to the window in the attic?! I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic! Hey. Ugh, I hate this year! Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world! Oh that’s right! Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. Oh yeah, like you never called! Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office. Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs. Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you’re right, this is easy. Oh well, all right um, no offense, but you were kind of rude. Oh. No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner? Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner. May I ask why? I surely do! Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner? No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me. Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself? Chandler? No look, II’m sure that people know you exist! Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you. All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend? Oh sorry, boyfriend! No, whatever! Anything! Yeah, he’s gotta go. No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me! Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here. Earl! I’m Phoebe. Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself. No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it! Because it was fate that made me call you today! No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself. Yes. I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this. No, it’s fate! Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager. Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, PEarl. Sure! Umm, where are you from? Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve gotI’ve got goose bumps. Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm. But if no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot! Y’know, I don’tI don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it’s you. Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast! Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me. I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud? Okay, who’s next? Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts. Least of all you. Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass! Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth! Because it’s our thirtieth birthday. Wait! Yeah. What?! Nu-uh! You have your birth certificate? Our mom. Do you have my birth certificate? Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31. I just lost a whole year of my life. Your middle name is Pamela? Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is? That’s my first name. Hey, what’s going on? Yay! I love drunk Monica! Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her. Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother. If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop. Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh? Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet! Wooo! Hoo! Okay quick, help me get this off! I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair! Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31? Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31! Like okay III, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school! No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. Oh yeah. Oh! You did the right thing. Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay? Yeah? Why? Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. Ohh, he left his cell phone. Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing. Yeah. That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long. That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together, having sex. No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago. Nice try. I don’t know. Ah-ha! Too cocky! Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone. Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet. Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide. Did I use that already today? I’m sorry. Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you. So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial? Hi! Good. Yeah. Yeah! Ooh, now you lost me. No I didn’t! No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work! That is a different phone. That is damning evidence. Hello? Yes, I’m the one who found your phone. Shhh! I’m on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. Bye. Oh? And how will you know what time to come over? Oh. Okay, well II was kinda hoping that I would just be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide. What?! That’s the first time today! Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door? Because it’s my apartment! Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China. Wow! How long were we arguing for? Could you-could you umm, give us one second? Wh-what do we do? Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up! Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore! Rachel, listen. I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one. Yeah! You’re such a great friend! Oh that’d be me. Sir. After you. Nice! Eeee! Eee! Eee! With what? Oo! You should have one of us do it! No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff! Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal! What?! No! It was my idea! Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache! Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering! What is it? Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. Oh. It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called? Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story! Say what? Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules! Why? I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! Okay, then I must be disoriented. I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling? Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes? Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects! Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night. What?! I know! Robin is so gay! I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up. Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief! Oh, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria. Oh. Since when are you into swing music? What is your job? Am I crazy or does this totally go?! Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica! Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter they’re both great! Got it. Hey! Rachel! Come on! I’m coming! I’m coming! Okay! Hey! What do I do?! What are you doing? Did you find the dress? Did you find the dress? I—We gotta get Monica. Oh my God! Excuse me! Excuse me! I know. Hand me a tissue. What?! Does that mean Carcass is available? Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it. Yeah, swing music is so out. Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living. Oh my God! I’m sorry, too soon. You go. Good for you! Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out! Go for it. I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill. I did, but that was really fun. Oh hey! Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. All I could think of was y’know, Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me? I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six. You sound like a guy. You’ll have a last kiss. Okay bye. Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love. I miss you too! No. Why? Okay, don’t sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. No, that is the last thing you want to do! Because you’re marrying him! All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband. That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight. Yes! Oh my God! You’re right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? Rach? Oh. It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in… …in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT! Oh hey! How was your audition? What are you doing? Oh! You got it?! The next next? What’s the matter? Grandma’s gonna have to get in line. Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous? Sure. Hey! Yeah! What?! Well, when can we have this shower? Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option? Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done! Rachel, calm down! Just calm down woman! Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little. Uh, here. What time? Finger sandwiches and tea. And chili! Both! Neither. Lusts of the flesh. I don’t know. A cowboy theme? Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone. Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you? Hey! Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! We have a guest list! Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. Hi! How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming. Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it’s so nice to see you. Okay. Hey Rach? Who the hell are all these people? Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that: Losers! You were supposed to tell her! Fine, I’ll go call her. And then for forgetting to invite you to it. Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave. We ruined everything. Sur-surprise. Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there? Oh! No problem! I… Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin! I like our way. Oh! Chess! Yeah. Hey! Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight? What is this? What’s going on? Joey’s! Yeah, I’m sure that happened. Sure! Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek. Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla. Yeah. To Ross. Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it. Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon. Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning. Really?! Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding. Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa. I know. I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I’ve had better. What?! Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. Oh! Yeah! Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you. Like… Or all the things you taught him. Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute. Hey! Well let’s just say its, she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing. Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce? Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs? Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh! Ahhh! Chandler and Monica! Chandler and Monica! CHANDLER AND MONICA! OH! MY EYES! MY EYES! NO! THEY'RE DOING IT! YOU KNOW?! Get in here! Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows? Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own. Bye Chandler! I miss you already. I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more! No! God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything! He's not backing down. He went to get lotion. Joey! Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons. Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra. You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now. Ooh. Here it comes. Our first kiss. And why not?! You're-you're what?! I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love! Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things. How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership. Hey. Oh! Okay. Oh, that’s beautiful. Hey! I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time. Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles. Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. Hey sweetie! Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going. Hey! Yeah! I know. They were mine. No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on. I’m wearing his briefs right now. I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick. And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin. There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you. I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that. Okay, whatever. Hey! Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut. Uh-huh. Huh. That’s great Joe! Uh-huh. Hmm? I think it’s important that you do. Feel better? Yeah, I understand. Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?! Oh! What are they? That play? The movie? Ohh! Oh, yeah! Back then yknow, we called it the Great War. It really was! Congratulations! Go ahead. Yes! Very good. Ross, please! My make-up! Whats up? Tell Monica Im sorry. Tell her yourself! Oh my God! Chandler just left though! Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry. Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?! Okay but if you dont find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass! Oh man. Okay. Well theres one down. Yknow she might not even notice hes gone. Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You cant do this here! Yeah, but youve got to pull yourself together! Monica cant see you like this! Then shell know somethings wrong! Yeah. Oh, thats gone too. This is Monicas bathroom right?! No-no! III found one. Sure. Do you need some floss? Oh heres a whole bunch. Oh my God! There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant. So I guess she wont be totally alone. I know! Monicas gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new? Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off? Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And Im still holding this. Right. Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using? Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it. You told them he was missing? Okay. Im going with you. Ross, youre tired. Youve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this. Okay. Wait, do you know how youre going to stall her? All right. Good luck. Oh my God! Is that him? He could be in disguise, yknow. What the hell are you doing?! Why not?! But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this. Found the vest! I mean were gonna have to keep an eye on it, yknow make sure we dont lose it again. So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart? Oh my God Monica! Wait! Maybe, maybe youre overreacting! You do that yknow. Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that. Okay. Yeah! Whats going on? Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?! Hey! Oh! You know?! What? Youll hi-ya? Well you obviously didnt see Chucky 3. What? Oh and theyre gonna have a baby. Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant? We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant——It’s because I am. Yes, I…I am with child. And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day I didn’t want to steal your thunder. I can’t say. I can’t say because he’s famous. Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. What?! Well he never said that to me! How about just the bridemaids? It is. Oh my God! So instead you told me Monica was pregnant. Sneaky. Uh-hmm. Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay. Really?! So, are you ready to talk about it? Now? Okay, we’ll talk about something else then. Who’s the father?! Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag? Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop. Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey! Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him. Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin… Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, James, James Brolin, are you sure? James Brolin said… What?! Why bother? Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant. When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure. I’mI’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure. I’ll run out and get you one. Oh no, she won’t tell us. See? This is why you register. 30 seconds. It’s time. Okay. Umm, it’s negative. It’s negative. Here. No, it’s positive. It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive. Well yeah, I lied before. Now you know how you really feel about it. With who? Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night? Hey! Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler? A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman. Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt! Oh yeah. Okay. Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course. Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor? What?! I think he’s cute. Believe me I’m trying. Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism. Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different. Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam! I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus. Oh yeah. That’s me. Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. David Lynn. Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying. Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet? Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther? Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby… Why not? Bus? Well-well but it is huge. You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this BandAid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of…See? Hey. All right. Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn! I can and I will! Hey! It’s Joey! We don’t know. Who? Who is it? Was that story over? Oh my God! I know who the father is… Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go! I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby. Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the BandAid off. What to you want to do? Really? Are you sure? Okay, sorry. Yeah. Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater. Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. What?! No! I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani. Ooh! A Salami Buddy! Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding? Yeah! Have a great honeymoon! It was his sweater, but—Oh my God! Me too! Yeah, bye. Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon. All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later. What?! They took mine to give to you! Maybe they don’t trust us. You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels? No you didn’t. Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar! What stuff? Did Rachel find you? Oh she was looking for you. Well, she really wanted to talk to you now. What? And? Oh sorry. And?! Maybe it’s something you ate? Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place. Well why don’t you use your key? Oh! We could have done that. Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them. Oh no. Didn’t you two already talk? Holy mother of God! That is brand new information! A little bit. Oh Ross. Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. Okay, we’re in. Hey! So how was the doctor? Good. Oh. Hi! Come on in! So how was the honeymoon? That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger. Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg. You have got to be kidding me! Monica! That’s not right! Start with where. I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex! Greg and Jenny? You got fake numbered. Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects. Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert! That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that! Regina Philange. No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it. Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think! You’re gonna get pregnant. Oh, you came on to Ross! Hey! Dinner was good! I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go! Oh, well hello there. I didn’t see this on the menu. Oh, so you're Monica’s boss? Oh! I sous stand. Oh you…you made pesto? Would you say your pesto is the best-o? I made it myself. Well, it’s no pesto. Ooh Monica! Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him. But why?! Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two. But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please? That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too. Love it! Hey! But… Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today. Because I’m dumping him today. He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. So did-did you get home from work okay? Did-did you get out of the shower okay? Then he comes over! I’m so worried about you. Uck! Be a man! You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself. Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself! Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch. Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch! All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! Hi. It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy. Aw. I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I… Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay. Monica! I’m breaking up with you! I’m, I’m breaking up with you. I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now. Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too. And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. Oh good! Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too? Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe! Wait a second! So, what’s new with you? What?! Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you. Really? Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying. By the way, it’s a costume party. No. But thanks. Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again. No, it’s me. Phoebe! That is so you! No wonder your pregnant. Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are. Ursula’s fiancée? Yeah. Yeah. My mother killed herself. No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe. Why are you looking at me like that? Okay. So, what are you? No II meant your costume. I love the second grade! Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games. Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula. Thank you. Hey. Ursula’s fiancée is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up! What? No I’m not! You are! Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet? Two weeks? That’s it? Oh really? Huh? Peace Corps, really? Hi liar! Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true. But they’re not! Why are you lying to him? You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight! Hmm? Oh. Sure it does. Yeah, yeah. Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world. Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you. She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was? Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. Just remember I’m a minute younger. No. You’re not, you’re not stupid. That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. What? Yeah, you should. Whos cell phone is that? Its just so annoying everywhere you go. I never get calls! Hello? Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, howd you get this number? Wow! What an incredible violationand wonderful surprise. Oh you did? He did it! He did it! Shhh! Im talking. Are you asking me out? Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister. No! Wait! I was just saying that so youd think I was a good person. Fight for me. Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours. Ive got friends too. Okay, bye. Oh my God! Im going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I cant make lunch. Hi! Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe this is too weird. No dont tear out your eyes! Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better? Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldnt be this hard. Yknow? This is our first date yknow? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand? and yknow first kisses andsecond kisses. Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment. No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later. Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see. Hey! Hey! Can we pick up where we left off? Why? What sex? We didnt have sex. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! You-youyou had sex with Ursula?! You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?! Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird. So I guess this is it. Yeah, so do you. Huh? Sure. Yeah, hes kinda sexy. Okay so, well just come up with some kind of signal if its going well you can take off. Oh. Why not? Oh Rachel, this is all so Papa dont preach. Wow! Oh well, I will be there! Gosh. Im not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him. Oh my God! Monica! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette party! Your secret bachelorette party. She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me! Oh, II dont eat meat. Yeah, I dont eat that either. Hes right though, the 74 is absolute piss. Rachel! Why, so he can get mad at the baby? Its slang for pregnant. Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah. Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely. Id better go. Just over here: I dont want to miss the fight. Thats it?! You call that a fight? Come on! We were on a break! No we werent! What happened to you two?! Wow, you told your dad the truth. Wanna go see a movie? Hey! I brought you my old maternity clothes! Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the babys born, theyre great for shoplifting melons. Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals! Hey! Happy Thanksgiving! Anything I can do to help? Sure! Okay. Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So hows the game? What? I dont believe you! That isbrilliant! And Monica has no idea? Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I dont think I can help you after all, I didnt realize this game was on. Well normally I dont, but yknowGreen Bay is playing. Well its only like my favorite bay! Actually, its not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J. Hey. Wow! Well done. Oh okay. Noooo! Damn you ref! You burn in hell! Yeah. Green Bay. Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green BayMermen. I think you do. What?! What else did you do? Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us! Oh! Wow! So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner? I wanna join! Im sorry. Im sorry. I never got to be in a club. II didnt go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour. Okay. Its exactly how Id imagined it would be. Joey! Those are my maternity pants! Is there anything we can do for you? How can you let him talk to your crotch like that? Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, I cant wait to hear your first words, I thought, Theres a trick. Okay. Hey Ross! Doesnt Ben go to the Smithfield Day School? Sting has a son that goes there too! You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?! Stings son, seven years old and theres a picture. No, its New York magazine. Its an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting? Uh-huh, yeah thats too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but its totally sold out. I know! Why dont you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two Ill take you. There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! Thats why you have kids! Wow! Theyre beautiful! What?! Well then get your money back and return them! Oh no! Why not? How come?! Wait! But Ross if they dont get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends. Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen! Your kid is seven?! Hes really small. Please! Please get the tickets! Yes you can! Sting says so himself! Rosssss can! Rossss can! Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets! Oh, there you are Ben! Well, I heard youre having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boys name is Stings son. Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers. Him youre friends with. Yes! Yes you can, Im looking for Jacks parents. Uh-huh, Im with Ben. I am one of Bens mothers. Im a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents. Oh. Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan. Yeah! Lets do that! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass. Wow! This place is incredible! Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway! Hi! Uh-huh. Why else would I be here? Uh-huh. Yeah. Umm, Im sorry. Wont-wont Jacks father be joining us? Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 oclock? Concert. Yeah. That does put us inquite a pickle. Because you see Im very busy before and after the concert, and hes obviously busy during. Unless! Unless umm, okay II would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course. Oh, thank you. Four would be great. Oh good! Then youre in luck! Bens not my son! The Police? Here? A reunion?! Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?! Oo, where are the seats? Okay, now would you say that thats more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family? Yeah? Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed. Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right? This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy. Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I wasI was thrice as randy. Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, thats what you need a goodpill. Yknow she has a face Ross! Bye. Wait, ImIm sorry. Whats the big deal about a holiday card? Oh hey! So, how did your doctors appointment go? Oh my God. Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy? You wish. Oh yeah? Come and get it. Ugh! Women! Give her a key to your apartment. No, we hate that. Hey. Ooh Ross! Howd the conversation go? Where?! Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger. So umm, Im gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out? Umm, hes here to have sex with you. Youre welcome. Its okay, hes a virgin. Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone. Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! Hey! I got you a present! I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here! Its a Ms. PacMan machine! I didnt know where to put it so I just left it here for now. Do you really like it? Oh really? What was your first? No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad. Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning. Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it. Yeah! Its not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game. Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials! Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good! I know! Dont touch me! I cant! I cant! Nooooo! You son of a bitch! Oh hi BenNo! Dont look at the machine! Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby? Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet? Me too! Uh huh! If its a girl, Phoebe, and if its a boy, Phoebo! Yeah, by Sandrine. How-how about you each get five vetoes? I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show! Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good? You guys? Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron. Uh-huh. Oh, just as well, I broke this one. What? Okay. Fine. Then its really too bad that you cant tell me. Is it Chandler? Well, then tell him to stop staring! Really?! Joey?! You dont say. I dont know, I dont know, I dont know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But yknow on the other hand No. No, I cant. Were friends. No, oh, no. I dont want to risk what we have. Sure, yeah. I mean, its Joey. I dont want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey! Sure. Hey. Umm, Joey, I know. I knooow. I know about your feelings. Yes, and Im sorry. II know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but thats very rare. For God sakes, its Rachel! Yeah thats Rachel. Beat me over the head with it. Yeah. Joey, I just think youre getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush. Absolutely! Yknow, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away. Thats right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know Ive had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And Im sure youve had them for us. Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here. Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey. Well, you were wrong, he doesnt like me! Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didnt like you? How would you feel? Really? Lee Majors is hot! Were in the bathroom! Mazel tov. Tell us what? Well, I left my guitar here again. Okay. Oh. Okay. Great! Umm. So do you want to hang out or something? Oh are you and Chandler. Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you? You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing. Oh my God! Youre getting a massage! You never let me massage you! You told me you hate massages! I cant believe this! How long as this been going on? Oh, it has a name? OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go! Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You! Why wont you let me massage you? Monica! We lived together for years! Ive seen you naked! Im curious about the human body. But Im a professional! And Im really good! Look, if youre uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please? It does! How would you feel if you couldnt share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldnt teach us about dragons. Potato, potaato. Are you under the sheet? Great, lets begin. Hows the pressure? Stating the obvious, but thank you. And its not weird is it. Thats right, you just enjoy. Okay. Hey. No-no, I got that. Okay. Okay but you should know though, Ive raised my rates to 200 an hour. I mean 500. 600. Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged! Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on. Really? Theres nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi. No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do! Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it. Yes. Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked? Thats it. Just relax. Come on more! Yeah, you like that dont you? You want it there? You take it there baby! Oh! Hey, Rach! Oh, you, too. Okay. Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top? Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone? So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together? Ugh. Come on, Mona, dont kiss ass. All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape! Its a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment? Yeah. Candys the mother, Cookies the daughter. The fathers also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people? Oh, Monica, grow up! Hey. Look, I know youve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate. He-hee! This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up! How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you? Taffy, really? Ive never had any. Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, youre just never going to tell her? If I havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? Whats the deal? Oh, its nice! May I try a pink one? Hey! Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog? Youre subdued. Did you give him a beer? Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment. Hes miserable! What happened to him? What stuff? OhJoey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him! Okay, Im going to take him back to Wendys. Oh hey you guys! Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates? Uh-huh, and you? Okay, good. Well last night, I met Monicas. Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half. Well hes tall. He has brown hair. He works with food! Obviously, and hes British. Yeah? And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident. Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more. Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat. Oh! Hi! Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don. Soul mate. Soul mate. Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So. Theyre just talking, and yknow what? Just because I think theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen. Yeah? Dont worry, well find you someone else. Im so sorry. I dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I dont know how you fight that. Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune. Oh yeah, Ive done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Yknow, and-and yknow, one of the great joys of life is its-its wondrous unpredictability. Yknow? And also tea tends to give me the trots. Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, whos next? Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle. Oh! Which can either mean youre having a baby or youre gonna make a scientific discovery! Umm Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, Im gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And hes gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. Oh wait a second you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners maybe hes the tea guy. Oh hello. Oh Jim, Jim Nelson Im Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately. Well, maybe we will. Oh! Isnt it funny how we kept running into each other? Its as if someone really wants us to be together. Oh, witty banter. Well done. Oh okay, well Im a masseuse, and I used to work at this place. III like, I like parties. Yeah I guess, a little. So! Umm, anyway II lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for ummWell since I was fourteen. Oh stop it. Okay. Umm look, youre coming on a little strong. But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why dont we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself. Okay. What?! Oh my God! Wow! You do? All right. Oh there it is. I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store. A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me? When I get up there Im going to kick some ass. Yeah, we both can. And we both will. Oh, you didnt have to come in with me. Okay. What? Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do? A little. Now youre talking. IIId love to. Let me just tell my friend. She mustve left. Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parents anniversary party? Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners. Yeah, hes really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am. Hey! Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is. Hey! Ill go with you. Were you guys making fun of Parker? So, he a little enthusiastic, whats wrong with that? Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people youve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends dont do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the whos who of human crap. No, Im fine. Im great. Im with you. Hm huh, yeah. No, thats not necessary. No, actually I dont eat. Okay, fine! Fine! Mmmhmmmmm. Why dont you just try one? Then you better do it now. Because Im going to kill him. You guys were right. Hes just too excited abouteverything. I mean Im all for living life, but this is the Gellers 35th anniversary. Okay? Lets call a spade a spade this party stinks. Are you sure it wasnt an oyster? Hes just such a great guy Im so excited about him. You think? Youre right. Youre right, hes just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! Im a sunny, positive person. Whats that now? Oh look its Parker! Oooh I love it! Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on! Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? Oh thank God. Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why dont we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! Lets try something else, lets play a game. Shocking! Lets play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. But, lets play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses! Oh my God! Oh my God! Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isnt perfect? Everything isnt magical? Everything isnt a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! You dont have to put a good spin on everything. No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid! Much less happy! So long! Dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! Uh huh. Hey! Oh. Finally! Oh. Im gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything? I was just being polite! Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! Umm, II just think you dont expect someone so hot to be so sweet. Umm, Phoebe Buffay. Oh okay, its P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in Ello there mate! Get your foot off my contestant! Judge! Ohhh. No! Hey-hey that's not a NutterButter, that's just an old Wonton! Ohh, tough call. Hey! Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut. Oh, please! Hey! About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do. Well I dont, I dont have a mother so often I forget that other people. No. Neither is mine. I know. I know, whats her number? Isnt it at three? Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right? What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green! Im so glad you could make it. Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with. No look, weve apologized twice! I cant do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it. For how long? She cant hear you. Well, if you dont want your mother to move in with you, just tell her. I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! Its time to open the presents! How about you less important people, lets open your presents! Okay, come on Rach its present time! Yknow youre the glue thats holding this whole party together. Its kinda falling apart here. Okay, this is from your friend at work. Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty? Not if you were here. No, not a thing. Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and shes been nothing but terrible to you. And dont forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasnt even thanked you for it. Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, Id tell her off. Uh-huh! Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. You were fantastic! Im so proud of you! You should be! You got it! Well thats no way to sell newspapers. Why dont you try, Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go? What?! Well did she know you two werent married? Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders! Sounds like youre a little jealous. Is that a real place? Are they hiring? Hey Chandler, why so fancy? Wait, I think I know someone who does that. Yeah, just dont get your hopes up. Well, the interview. Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression. Oh you dont know. Yes, when I first met you, you were like, Blah, blah, blah. I was like, shhh! Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy. Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are. All right, dont freak out! Okay? II will help you. How long before you have to leave? I cant help you. All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So lets say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. Hi! Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange. Bing, what an unusual name. Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on what you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do. I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way. You gotta go! Okay, dont worry. Youre ready. Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great. I started that! Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end. Or you can do volunteer work. Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe. PhoebePhoebePhoebePhoebeBurrrrr! Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress. When she comes out, you hold her nose, Ill blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her. I dont know. II think its still gonna be a while. Youre on! One hundred thousand dollars! Fine! Ill call Zurich and move some money around. No ones here! Oh damnit! Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, youre still pregnant. Oh, Im sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Yknow what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks. Its interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose? Fine! Youre on! Until then, General Grant, why dont you set up camp right there. Good God man dont anger it. Oh II dont know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. Thank you! Okay. Is Rachel having the baby? Theyre at the coffeehouse. We know its a girl! Oh you made it! Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest. Sure! What? Oh, this is fun. Yeah. Why arent you with Rachel? But yknow what? It just seems that you two belong together. Right. And with who again? I know! Oh, it ate your money? All right, Ill see you downstairs then. All right. Hi. Oh down please. II hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? Sure! I feel so bad for you I broke my leg once too. Well, its a long story. Its kind of embarrassing. Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you? Oh. Uh-huh, yeah. Oh yeah! II would like that. Wait! What?! No! Elevator! No! Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive. Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in? Hands. Thank you. No! Ooh, this is it! Oh, thats him! Thats him! Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first. No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything. But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks. What else? What else? Oh. Ah-uh. Oh. Enter Pheebs. Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla? Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? Im sorry. Oh, Ill get it. Relax, its not like were forking. Yknow what? This one is. Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet. Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room? Okay. Okay. IOkay ummthisII sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm yknow, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than Im coming off right now. Youre right, that was wrong. Im sorry. Im so sorry. Its just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over? Uh Joey, were trying to dial down the crazy. Umm, look we dont, we dont really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I dont know about you but that doesnt happen to me a lot. Can we come in? Hi! Oh, shes so beautiful. Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! Youre so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I wont. Ohhh. Oh, wait a minute its not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original! Yay! Is she in there? Oh! I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel? Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again? No, I know. I know, because youre not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are. Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer. I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it. Right. Or you might get everything youve wanted since you were fifteen. Oh and I need to talk to you. To see if know what these guys are talking about. Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel? Yay! Its so exciting! Wow, you couldve done that with us there. Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you cant talk to Rachel. Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy. Hey! Are you all right? Oh my God! He did it? Are you kidding? Im like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group. I just talked him into it, dont tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people. Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so. Especially Ross! There he goes, your fiancée. Although he does play with himself in his sleep. Oh hey! Wait up! Congratulations! I didnt want to say anything in front of Joey cause I didnt know if he knew yet. No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged! Oh, its a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havent done the secret thing in a long time. Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor? All right, me too. Should we wake her up? And so engaged. Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart. Really? So whose ring is it? Is it an engagement ring? But you didnt give it to her? But you were going to propose? Huh, I might be losing interest in this. Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment. No! No, she said you actually proposed to her. No they ran out of Its a girl but I can fix this one, See? Look at all the stuff people sent! Shes just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy. Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy! I dunno, well he got over the We were on a break thing really quickly. You know thats thats her. Oh no, Rach, no no, you know youre never supposed to wake a sleeping baby. I can say I told you so but shes kinda doing that for me. It really does how long do you think we have to stay? Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe! Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross! Alright you guys, we cant turn on each other, Okay?  Thats just what she wants. Oh Im kinda part of this. I knew I should have married Chandler. Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so Im just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! Alright, Ill try, fine! Yes, Okay! Shh! Nothing works with this child! I have to go scream into a pillow. Have I gone deaf? You must be a fireball in bed. I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again! Im kidding. Thankfully you dont need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel lets give it six to eight months. Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead. So? No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Ugh, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors. Oh, Rachel! Oh, yay! Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That's fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time. Trick or treat! Ooh, and treat it is. Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts. Ohh. Oh wait! you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you? 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! Hey hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces? You smoked! Chandler, you stink of cigarettes. Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound, and the breasts of a great goddess. I'm gonna go. Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late. I'm starving. I knew we were coming here tonight, so I ate nothing all day. Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing. Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long. One really does have a stick up one's ass, doesn't one. No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I'll cave. Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order? Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend? Both it is, thank you. You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two? And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma? Where, where have you been? You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order. Aw, what? It's a good toast. Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now. Well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello? Okay, that was Mike. Huh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, okay, I'm gonna take off. Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye. I know! Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be, having that conversation. Maybe not, is it? I know Mike, why don't you keep digging? Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars. Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike. Oh no, I want to. Yeah, ooh, wow. Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to, do this with. Here you go. It really is. Oh my God! David! No! It's a great time, come in.! WOW, hi. Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk? Who cares, it got you here. Wow. Where is your luggage? AAllright, well. I'll call the cab company. Thank you! God, no! You should see me when. Oh actually, no, I look pretty good. No. I'm. I'm just. I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike? He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no. Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just, I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible. Really? Chandler? Oh. Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night. I know! Evil! And, and, and. I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God! Uhuh. Yeah.!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am. I mean I guess, I just have to, tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't. You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong. Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey. Hey! Okay. No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny. Oof. Oh, wait, wait! No, no, it's not that. Uhm. Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm. I am. His, his name is Mike. Yeah, I should have told you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I am happy. Well, but David, just. I just want you to know that, that, you know, telling you this, is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate. I mean. Yeah? Well, if that's what they do in Minsk. In New York, it's. Hmmm. No, no. No, I can't do this. It's bad. No, no. No. Look David, if, if you had never left, then, yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but, you did leave, and II'm with Mike and I really care about him. And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you. No, no, no, no, no. It's not, it's not, i'ts not as bad as it looks, really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend. No, uhm. David and I did use to go out, but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only, he's only in town for a couple of days. No, no. Oh, well, yeah. Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go. Okay, well, guys? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you. If you want your key back, I totally understand. Right! Never! Never! I swear! Hi! Listen!

Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it? Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it. Sure, what, what was the work thing? Pick up grandma at the airport? PhoeBe. Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying. You are a terrific actor. Thats a great movie. PHOEBE. No you're all about the fun. There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway. It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency. Ooh, what happened? No! Nothing with a raccoon. Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too. Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this? It's all right. You can mourn. Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet? Broke them all, huh? You gonna tell her? No problem! Next week: stealing. Chandler walks away to store the box of broken china. Hi. Oooh. Girl's night out indeed. Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross? I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross? Oh my God! I love things. What happened? Eye-contact? I hope you were using protection. Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes. So? What if they do? Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as eye-contact. Yeah. I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend. Oh my God, you're giving your real number. Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking? What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it? Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough. Better! Really? You're moving on from Ross? Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone. Dead on. Hey, Mike, it's me. Listen, is um, is Ross near you? Well, you have to go back in. I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone. So, you have to intercept all his calls. He says he can't do that. All right. Hello? Hi. I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff. Oh, Mike. Bye. Oh. Well, good bye. I know. That was fun. Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom. sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle. Uh-huh. Oh, I like my job. So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some. Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern. No-no, we do it every year! No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that. Oh no, we have to! Well then, you should look with us. Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah. Ooh ooh, we have a live one! Ooh, who's it for? Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I. You guuuyys. Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin? I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash. Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore. You could do that? Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV! Oh, really? Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up? Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse! Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous. Okay, now. What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. Okay, that helps. Hey. So, what did he say? I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor. Joey. Who dies? Yes, doctor. Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming! Yes, I did it! I nailed it! Yay! What's next? Okay, from the top, people! Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe? Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans. Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children. Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him? About what? And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky. Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back. I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process. Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened. Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here! Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru? No. It starts with a v and ends with an x. Helpfully with a to in the middle. What? Oh, whew, no, that's Bob. Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies. What are those? OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob. So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. Hey Mikey. What are you doing? To kill Bob? No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl. I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom! I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl. Oh my god, we killed Bob! Suzie? Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies! I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother. No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them. Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed. Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now. Mate? They're all brothers and sisters. No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like. That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do? Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites. You must think I'm crazy. Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to, let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from, when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I? Well it depends. On how far along he's in the sex change process! Your knuckles are kinda hairy too. Wow! Talking about high maintenance. I'm a woman! Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight? But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out. Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing? OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing. While drinking. Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there. Oh my god. It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper. Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you! No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world.! Thank you! Hi hi. Oh you have got to sing. But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice. All the time when you're cooking. Yeah you're always singing Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy. OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there? Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone. Can you totally see through her shirt? Every little bit of you! Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but. Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands. Yes, she gives the people what they want. Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again. Hey. What you got? Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food. Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too. I don't know. They're so perfect for each other it's crazy. I just wish they'd realise they should be together. I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children. You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other. So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people? Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together. Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan-laugh. Ooh, Joey. Hey. I'm so excited I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me. Oh, yeah. A teacher? Well, Ross does. What. You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! Yeah. How do you even know a woman like that? Joey. So now what do we do? What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up! Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together. It's not Santa's plan. No, it's. No, I think we killed it. Hello? Hey, Rach! You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned. Did he go out for a cigarette? My dear, sweet Rach. By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan. Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey? How - how do I get them to name the next one after me? Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes. Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working. Don't, don't do the plan-laugh. Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again. Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run! Mexico! What's your news? Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people… come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey! That's great. Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight? Oh, I hear divorce bells. No. Lowell, is that you? Oh my god! I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross. Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this! Good for you! Ouh… Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up… I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I… Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer… She was a drug dealer! Okay… Why? You were? Oh my god… No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. Okay, I think we have a problem here. Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said. I know… I mugged Ross! Hey, you! Hey, how was class? Nothing, I really wanna know. Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid… You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl. Yes, it was. Gimme your money, punk! Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say… Really? Even more humiliating than… Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found Science Boy. I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. You're welcome. And thank you for Science Boy. I learned a lot from him. Why? Oh you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you. I want you to stay. Why don't you turn them inside ou. I'll miss you. Great! Ok. I'll go get the tube top. Wow, Mike Hannigan. You sure know how to make a girl say Hell yeah! Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together! I've always wanted to live with a guy. Pick up your socks! Put down the toilet seat! No! We're not having sex anymore! It's gonna be fun! Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news. I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before. Okay, well you put down the toilet seat. Uh huh we're playing you two. Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know. I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut you know.near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior. Oh my god I do. I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom! Yeah! You bet roomy! Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. China patterns! Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy. Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes. What do you mean? Oh. Wow. Was it really that bad? Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean. But it's just. Oh! No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister! Yeah I get that. Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage. No. I really wanted to know how you feel about it. Mike doesn't ever wanna get married. Never. I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks! That's not how you really feel is it? Seriously? You divorce-o? It's ok that's how you feel. I do love Mike. Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks. It's not cooler. Better. Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you. What do you mean? They are awfully boxy. Uh huh. Just one last time erm, the marriage thing, there's no wiggle room? None at all? Right. Except that I do want to get married. Someday. I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff. Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you. But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen. Are you gonna change yours? Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want. I don't want it to end either. Yeah. Hi. Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike! Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it, but. I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this. Well no, when I get to the point where, you know. I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike. I'm gonna come to you. Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future, but, pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that. Unless. Maybe it's too crazy about this. Alright so, you know, there is no future, but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said. That was a test and you just failed. God, I wish Mike were here. I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that. Here. Okay. Yes. Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time. You can't have it. No. Oh yeah. Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing! You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building. Those are my shoes. Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now. I ordered Chinese food. What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!? I'm sorry, I broke down. I wanted to see him. There is a speakerphone on the base unit. Not if nothing happens. Why can't, why can't we just hang out as friends? Sit down. Thanks, you look good too. So how's the piano playing going? I've missed you too. I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard? What? Oh, I missed you so much! Who is this? Hey will you get me tickets too? You don't wanna win the lottery? Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight! Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses! I hope I win! One, two, three! Get a room! Oooh, I like that, daddy. Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me? Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl? Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed. Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together. OOOOOHHHHH! OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! Don't come any closer! No, what's more important, your friends or money? Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets? Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this. Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl. What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun. So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember? As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish. Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do. Guys, the drawing is about to start! I'm still looking through mine. You guys, what was the Powerball number again? We won. We won! Don't tear it. I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars! I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this! It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents. I beg to differ. Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her. Hey! Sure! Well, I can't give you a massage, because my license has been revoked again! Well, it was an accident. You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Oh no! You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years! Oh, good! Ok, good for you! Try to recapture the magic! And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing! And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè! Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain! Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, You suck and shut up and go home. Yeah. But what? Ok, say no more.  It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaage! Classy, uh? Hey! Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back. My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? Yeah well, excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it! Well, it's not about quality. Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica. Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? What are people having, the garlic Martini? Food here at 'Javu', will kill you, the food here at 'Javu', will kill you. You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you! Get your garlic-peelers off me! Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha! Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?. Oh. Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! I'm sorry too. Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p. Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? What is it? I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want? Hi! Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods? Ah, ah. Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out! Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us? And that horrible museum tour! We know about your party Joey. Hey! Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? Hey Ross! Oh, What's the matter? Worse? No. Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper? Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe PhD. You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny. Ok well give her a chance to see all of that! Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch! Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism. Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid! Hey! Hey you guys! Look what I just got. I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain. Oh, then I overpaid. What's up? Hey, Rachel! No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these big massage places! They're putting people like me out of business! Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about, it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us, the hollow shells. Well, do you care about friendship? I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend. Promise? Thank you. Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me? But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are. 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine! Ok, are they listening? Hello ja, it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole. Okay, then I'm Swedish. It's a normal Swedish name. Ikea. Ja! Time for your scalp massage! Is something wrong? Uhm. Stockholm. Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! Oh, Ja! Ja! Uhu, uhu, and why do you think that is? Or, maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass! You know it's me? How can you come here? I don't have to tell you everything! Tips not included. Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know, you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes! You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back! Ok. Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you. Good morning receptionist. Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back? Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy. Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass! That's off, right? Oh. Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you! So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him! Exactly! I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics! Ok, that'll be great! Oh, I'll take some of that. No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah. Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets! Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room? Ok! So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie? Why? Who else? You like Joey? Oh my God! Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him? Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right. Yeah. Sure! Oh. Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin? Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me. I didn't say anything yet! I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends. Well, some things are just hard to say to your face. Ooh! We have a problem. Good plan. Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at who's more over who! Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party. Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture. You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room. David? Oh my God! Yeah. What-what are you doing here? What happened? Yeah? Well, it's great that you're back! How are you? Good! Oh, good for you. Mike and I broke up. Really? I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us! Well, no. I'd love to. Ok. Oh, got it, stay upwind of me. I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures. No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die. Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now, tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there. Mike? Who's Mike? That's right! Oh, yeah. Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That'sThat's, a blast from the past! Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time! I'm sooo sorry! I just. I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. WhyWhy do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right? Yeah. You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone! Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling! Not Joey. Yeah? Are you leaving The Supremes? Wow? Really? That's fantastic! Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: Mike, do you take Phoebe. You know, it's every girl's dream! Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike. David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna! Sure, ok, yeah. Oh my God, Mike! No, Mike's here. What are you, what are you doing here? No! I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future. David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong. Yes! Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!  and? All right, all right. I'll play if we don't keep score! Nobody wins! Yeah, I'm out. Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing! No idea! I though he was soft like you! Monica, you call it. Tails! He was a lawyer! Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you, you're not even, a little turned on by Monica, right now? C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head! I sleep with him! Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back. Mike wins? You can't do that! Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister. It's like watching porn! Hey! Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want. Is that Ross? Sounds like he's with someone. Oh that tart, floozy, giant. Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business. Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend. Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey! Get over here! We've got shoes being kicked off over here. You gotta hear this, it's great. It's like free porn! That's the door. He's gone. Oh, we're just, we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you. Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa. Shhh. This is the listening side of the wall. Now, what is this? Oh no. Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross? Hey, have you guys seen Monica? Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright. Uhm. You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign, you feel free to roam about my cabin. Aaah, you're not good at this. No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right? What? Why not? You have a. You have a date? With who? You have, have a girlfriend? For how long? Three months? Okay. This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her? Oh, okay, good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you. You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there. Hi, Mike's place. Ooh, that was fast. Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair. Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F. Y. I. Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound? Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. I. I'm Phoebe. Enchanté. Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know. Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is. I'm gonna take off. Alright. Susie, can I call you Susie? Yeah, I can't say that. uhm. Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you. Mike and I are back together, and uhm, unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours. Well, I don't. Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you. Okay, not a fan of the tough love. But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me. Look, Precious. Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you. He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend. You're welcome! Hey guys! Hey, have you seen Frank Jr, 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets. Hey, what's all this stuff? Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one! Oh, how does it work? Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you. Hey! Good to see you. Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels. Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute. Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing. That's a, that's a long time. Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area. What? Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them! What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one? Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we? Insane. Alice would never go for it, right? Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up? Frank Jr. Jr? Uh-huh. Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie? Alright, so that leaves Chandler. Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids. I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there. Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together. Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Hey. Still, he had to find out sometime. Hey! Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town. You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? Oh, so sorry to catch you on your MoBile! If-if you don't wanna get me on my moBile, don't call me on my moBile! Oh, I know! Oh. I slept with Billy Joel. All right, who hasn't? Ugh, Let's just cut her out! Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point! Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again. Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas! Ok, don’t hold thy breath! Why, why, why didn’t you just say no! Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture! I did! Hey! No. Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here? Are you kidding, I love it! Hi! Musty! Well kinda. Yeah well, in America you're just an ass. Oh my God. Was Mike with him? Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute? Please, Monica? In the hall? It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill. You're also so generous and kind and scrappy! Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in. Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you. Yeah, I guess you're right. Oh, COOL! Wow, it's like a time capsule! Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people! Yeah! I wrote Emma a song. Joey, it's a birthday party. Oh! Or you could stick a fork in an apple! Separate performances. Sure, yeah! Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared? That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma! No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading. “Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot. And you know, I have a massage client soon. Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go. Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! No, it did not. Joey? How could you just let them leave? Wh, what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute! Well, oh, ok now. Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go! No, lets just draw straws. Yeah! Let's do that! Ok! I want the dolphin! I'm too excited! Go! Go! Good job Alan! Yeah, see you later! Hey, are Ross and Rachel back? Oh good, I didn't miss the party. I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright. Hey, you made it into a bunny. Hey! Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary. YEAH! Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game. Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and. I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room. Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos, they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! Can’t believe it's been a whole year! ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH! YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY! Oh how lame, oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal. Oh, it’s the worst way to propose! Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. Well, mine was worse than that. We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing. Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night! Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this! Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate? Well, do you think I should propose? Ok, ok, so how should I do it? Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would, would you two like that? No, I've got work and then I'm proposing. Uhuh, uhuh. I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win. Thank you Thor! Where, where are you going? Well, I think you should wait. Well, if you don't, if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients. Mike Hannigan, will you marry me? That's not very enlightened! Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you! That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls. I would love it. Consider it forgotten. But just so you know, however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether, whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake. It's in the cake, isn't it? What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Oh my God! Wait! Oh wait! Oh no! Uh-huh! Yes! I love you more! Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this. HUGE engagement ring! Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever. Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you! It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated. I would, but you're the last one. Oh, my first love! Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach. Oh yes, they are. Hey! Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in. Yeah. Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together? Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know! Oh, you should take her! Why, you don't like her? Really? You think? Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized, if I do that, that means you don't get her. Hi! Sorry, I'm late. No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours! Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame. Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too! Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. Tails! Monica, she's yours! Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster. Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom? Hey! You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. I knew it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break. Sure. It's just as well. I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch. Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition, with yourself. Hey! Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day. You're not making the pies yourself? Hey Rach. What's Emma doing today? Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant. Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog! Oh, okay. Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition. Well, I was thinking. Yeah! Hey. We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks! Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man. But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way! Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the TriState Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma! Yeah! Yeah! Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup! Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants! Why not! Oh! No, we're late! Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani! Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee! And it looks like she put makeup on her! You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier! Alright, what are we gonna say? Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged! We're just, we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR, or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her. Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy. Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?. It's locked. What are we gonna do? I'm starving. Oh yeah! Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us. So bad. Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize. Here! Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving. I'll pull you through. I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants. Just a sec, we're kind in the middle of something here. Oh, right! Your adoption interview! What are you gonna name the baby? Hey! Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends! Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists! Mandy. No. Fine, I'll give you her number. SARAH! Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right? Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night. Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back? What are you talking about? Sarah's great! That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal! What? I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER! Oh. Thank God you’re here. Listen to this! Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries. What? You know about the plate thing? You wouldn’t let her have a grape? Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table! Wow! Yeah! What? They will be! Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got. Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later. If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex? Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food? Ok, how about, uhm, sex or dinosaurs? Oh, how cute! Oh, she looks just like a little doll! Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler. OH! He's having an affair. You know, I'm always right about these things. Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her! Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down. Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm. I know that Monica is working today so. I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel. Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either Liar, Liar or Betrayal, or. An Affair To Remember. Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm. What? Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them. I got them! So, should we tell her? Why? Who’d you seen him with? TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW! All right. He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat. Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you. They went in together. So sorry. What? Why do you have a realtor? So you're gonna move? Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door? Wha? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers? Yeah, but so is this. You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles. Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. Easy. Step. How did it get on? Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out! Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass! Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore. You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! What else? That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters. You're gonna be okay? Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. Great! Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing. Thank you so much for this. Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting? You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about. Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm, raunchy! Really? So this is, this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea? Oh! Oh, God! Rachel? Are you kidding? How old is your phonebook? Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off! This is how I look when I'm turned on! Shocking! Three hundred dollars, are you kidding? No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything! I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this. Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man? You know, it's fine. We'll pay you. Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch. There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay? Finish it! Your last dance. Do it for us. Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time. Oh this is so ho-o-ot! Oh no, no, no, don't stop! Oh, hey Joey. Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison. Yeah. Well, uhm, listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and, uhm, well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday. No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and, well, I would just really love it if you would do it. Yeah, you've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom. So, what do you say? Oh, thank you. I hope. I hope you know how much you mean to me. Oh. Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello. Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don'tI don't, it doesn't matter to me! Well, I don't care, so you pick! Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that. Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that. Ok, so. 1800 minus twelve is, one thousand, seven hundred and. Ok. Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding. What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums. She did? Why? Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free. Hey! Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us? Rehearse it! So Rach. Where is Emma? What's up? Uhm, well, they're not in the wedding. I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so, you know, you were-you were, if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut. Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian! I don't have a fax machine. I decided to pee. Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much! Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's. Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today. Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that. All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid. Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I, oh I, hum. I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because, it's not important, she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know, it got, it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here. And, moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm. Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to, that, to. Oh, ok, well, uhm, I. Ok, ok, I, ok, I. MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done. YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers! Hey! Oh, happy my wedding day to you! Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just, here as a bridesmaid. Wow, this is a lot! You won awards? Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins? Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word lorkins what flowers would that be? Right there! That's why I'm marrying you! No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello? Okay. Oh my God, what's it doing here? Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me? Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!? Help me. I want you to be Crazy Bitch again. Please? More than I wanna get married. About what? I know. What? What do you think? Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it? Oh, okay. Hi new dad. Uhuh, uhuh. Oh my God! This is really happening. Oh, thank you. I love you guys. Okay. Oh wait, oh no. Wait. I don't care. I'll be my something blue. Thank you. Na-ah. When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need. You are my family. Oh wait, oh I forgot, and uhm. I love you, and you have nice eyes. I do. I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing. Hi. Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there! Oh, why? What's up? Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors? Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami. All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is My name is Claude, so, just repeat after me. Je m'appelle Claude. Well, just, let's try it again. Je m'appelle Claude. Uh. It's not, quite what I'm saying. It does, really? All right, let just try it again. Really listen. Je m'appelle Claude. Oh, mon Dieu! Hi! Oh! Ok. What are you gonna be doing today? Je m'appelle Claude. Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. je. m'ap. pelle. Great, ok faster! je. m'ap. pelle. Je m'appelle! Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you! I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. Hey Joey. Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again. Really, can I hear some of it. Well, you're not, You're not, you're not, again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH! How could you possibly think that? Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder. Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui. Merci. Au revoir. Okay, can you really tapdance? It's off the resumé. Archery? Horseback riding? You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds? Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds? Ready. GO! You did it! Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night. Wow! I do, he's been working on that all day! Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to GellerBing? Where did you go to do it? Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name? All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan. What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it. Okay! Good for you. That was really mature. Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's, he's just. All right, prude. Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here. This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't. I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'mI'm hiding from the law. You're fun. Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be BuffayHannigan or HanniganBuffay? Well, not anything, I mean. Oh, this could take a while. Okay. Hey! Oh, not anymore. I changed it today. Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock. Uh! Princess Consuela. Uh-huh! Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie. What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen? Ross. Can you? And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. Oh God! Welcome back! Oh, me too! Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay. Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! Nope. Yep. Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it. Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to? Mike Crap Bag? You're not serious, right? Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it. And I love Crap. Thank you, mister Bag. Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client. Er, Rita, this is my husband. Yeah. Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag. Yeah. Ogh. Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again? How about uhm. How about BuffayHannigan? Yeah. I'm Phoebe BuffayHannigan Banana Hammock. It's a funny word. Oh crap! Ooh, what's going on? Good for you! Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey. You okay with this? Talking to Ross. Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins. Anyway. Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? She died. Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one. Yeah, she was just an agent. Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge. Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else. Hey. Everything ok? Estelle? Why? I'm guessing she does. Joey: Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this. Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her. Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. Man, tough week for Estelle! Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok? No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might. No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you. Because patience is the road to understanding which, is the key, to a happy heart. All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you? Joey, it's Estelle. Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me. Well, I didn't think I should just drop by. Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay. It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge. Hey! Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig. Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party. Uh-hmm. Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again! I know. Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you. It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs! I love you too. Please don't. Don't turn into, you know. French bitch! Ok. Are you wearing waterproof mascara? Oh, you're so screwed. She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually. Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you. God. Ross, get ready to do some serious crying. Yeah! These are not mine. Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice. Where do you think Mike really is? I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well. You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense. Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her. Tell me about it. All right, I think I'm gonna head out. I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here. How was your night? Yeah, you got to get to the hospital. Okay. All right, ready? All right, here it goes. Morning. What's that? It's a baby chick and duck! I did not see that coming. Yes. That is the rule, though. Guess what? You're almost an uncle! Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl. Have you seen him throw a ball? What's that smile? Did something happen with you two? But do you wanna get back together? YAY! Yay! Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! Daa - raa. When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes. Guess we'll never know how it ends. Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm. Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go. I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam. Can't a girl finish a song around here? Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom. Unbelievable! Hey, what are you working on? How sweet! Oh, is that the baby? Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel? What? How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night. Uh, Joe? No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's. It's a city of Gunthers! Hey! What do you have there? Honey, that's gorgeous! Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard. Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open! Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat. One? How about a whole bunch? Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull. So, you just let her go? But now she'll never know how he feels! Woo! Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat! You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport. Hurry! That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car. Okay! I - I don't take passengers. My medallion number is, Get out of the cab! Get out of the cab! You can open your eyes now. Yes. Yes, she jumped right back up. Do you wanna get to Rachel in time? You should have thought of that before you got in! Toll-booth. Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment. Hurry! Okay. Damn, that window is clean. Ross, where are you going? What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before? You have to get a ticket to get past security. Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass! Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out? We're on our honeymoon. I'm so lucky I married you. No, did we miss it? Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God. Hey, it's me. Here's Ross. Well, I've never gone this fast before. She's got her cell, you could call her. You don't have any other choice! Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane? For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport. Uh, Rach, hang on. Uhm, actually no. No, you've. You have to get off the plane. I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange. I don't see her. There she is! RACHEL! Okay, you're on. I'm sorry. Hey. Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway. He went home. He didn't want to see anybody. Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment? So, I guess this is it.
