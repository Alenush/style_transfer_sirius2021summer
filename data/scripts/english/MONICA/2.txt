I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross. Guys, you got your hair cut. This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen? It's just an expression. Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking? No, although now that's what I'm thinking. Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? Why not? No you're not. Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too. Please, just a little bit off the back. Rachel, how did this happen? Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't-- but this is about your horrible mistake. You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. I promise. What? I didn't say anything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. How who wears it? Demi Moore is not a he. That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore. Oh my god! She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost. I KNOW! Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better. Thank you. My hair is very amused. Ok, um, I'll go with you. It's gonna be a problem, isn't it? But I'm- Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal. You're welcome. Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. We were shopping, and we had lunch. You had a salad. Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. Hey, where is everybody? Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket. You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card. That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent. Judy. Julie. Jody. Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping. Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me. Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out. That is not true! Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. I don't know what else to say. I feel terrible, I really do. Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible? It's that terrible? Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you. Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me? I'd do anything for you. So how was Joan? How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things? Hello, Mr. Heckles. We're not doing anything. Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down. Stop with the broom, we're not making noise. Mr. Heckles. That's terrible. What can we do for you? Well, what about his family? I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it? ...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge! Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps. It doesn't go with any of my stuff. You don't have any stuff. No. Mmmmm. Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while? Hide the Lamp. Did you know I was allergic to shellfish? Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke. Phoebe, tell her! Chandler, you're not gonna die alone. You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone. You are not a freak. You're a guy. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different. No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone. You made it! No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment. That's fine. Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell. I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything. Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. Well, didn't you? I can't believe you didn't tell me. What have I not told you? Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat. Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple. That is wild. Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it. I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again. Hell, I wanna see Joey. All I say is, she better get the job. You know, it still smells like monkey in there. Rachel, that's all we do. Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine. Oh my god. I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice. Who is also in charge of purchasing. Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there. Oh, wait, and I got a beeper! Oh, sorry. Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. Oh, thank you! All right, what's goin' on? Ok. If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. All of us. I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look. Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you. It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat. Like? Charity? Guys, we bought the tickets. Well, I guess now we can't go. You know what? You're right. All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then. You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this. You know, the guys are probably having a great time. That was amazing! Do I know you? Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been? You can't be a lawyer. You're eight. Uh, wait, backstage? Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him? Uh, good. No, I just, I fell down. You know, a party, or-- That would be the work of a Blowfish. It's work. Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page. Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired. Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying? Maye it's me. There's my little boy. He hates me. My nephew hates me. What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then? That is so funny. Let me see that. Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god. Oh my god. Is your tongue swelling up? All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital. Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot. Jacket now. Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me? Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand! Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts. That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you. Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin? No. But I remember people telling me about it. Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass. That was you? Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying. Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you. Please. Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before. C'mon give me five more. Five more. Five more and I'll flash you. Yo Bing. Raquetball in 15 minutes. Only if you say his full name. Alright. Why not? OK, if you say stop, then we stop. No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo. No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'. Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What? Well, thanks. Well, you know. Uh-huh. Well no, but um. Ya know, I try to stay positive. . . Alright. OK. Just for a little while. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! Do not start without me. Do not start without me. There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me. There's an ad for a naked chef? Wait a minute. I thought last night was great. We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel. So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear. I'm sorry? Ohh. All right. Mmm-mmm. I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that. Mmm-mmm. Wow. Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. Mmm. Abso...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate. Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas. How about mockolate mousse? Ok, how about pilgrim mockolate mousse? We'll put buckles on it. No, I'm sorry. Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served. Oh my god good? You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency. This was your idea? Yeah. You! Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate? Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate. What? Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Well, uh, I ate some. Hello? Listen, I, I don't think this is the best time. Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music? Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash. Cat hair. Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it? Oh, you are so great! Thank you! They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. Ross, I thought you were over this. What? Oh, honey. God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck. All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you. Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"? Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it. If you want. All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! Joey, speed it up! Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry? All right, you! All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon. Hi. It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. So we're back on? You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes. Would you look at them? Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married? All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion. And the fact that they're both monkeys. 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like. Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this. Excellent! Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon. And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. Ross, there he is. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot. The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop? Rachel, he like, totally changed time. Oh, yeah. He could hear me. Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook. So what'd he say? Well, thanks anyway. Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do... Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. What did you say? Ya know, you had no right to go out with him. You sold me out. Yes you did. Absolutely. Did you just flick me? Quit flicking You flicked me first. Uh-huh. OK. Yes. Fine, I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy? This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date. Well, what made you make the exception for me? Say you're sorry. Say it. Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it. Say you're sorry. What're you gonna do? You don't have the guts. I'll help you fix your sweater. I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him. I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves Well, bye for me too. OK. But no. Maybe if I were baking. And the fact that they're both monkeys. 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'

I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves Well, bye for me too. OK. But no. Maybe if I were baking. Great. Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing. A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like. You got it. Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce. Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it. That's your call. Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos. They'r alright. No really, they're OK. Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne. I'm outa here. Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me. Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent. No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you. Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons. Hi. So, what's this. Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room? Oh, God forbid. Where have you been? No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet. Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it. Because they made me. Anything larger back there? You have dinosaur checks? Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful. Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then. Hey, you got me, put it in. You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom. Over here dad. Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds. Oh, you look so great. Oops. Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you. Oh, dad, turn it off. Dad, it is not. What's with the red light? Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper. I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob. If you're not going then I don't want to go either. I can't believe you did that. Mom, I'm hungry. Alright. Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she? Tonight? What's tonight? Uh, hello. Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you? Yes but my mom got me this job. Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing. Sorry we're late. Dr. Burke, it, it's me. Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight. I've been great, just great. How have you been? The head tilt? I'm sorry. Oh, that's too bad. You've got to get back out there, it's your party. You're an opthamologist. Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency. I am not. Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up. Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me. Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment. Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age. Really. Good, they feel good, in my head. You too. OK, um. Goodbye. What? Thanks. So, I guess I better be going. Thanks again. Stop sending food to our apartment. No one. Nothing. Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental. It's Richard Burke. Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with. When? Wow, is that Michelle? I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional. I thought she just had one. Oh, you're a grandpa. I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in. Yeah. So maybe we should just. . . Wow, this really sucks. Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we? Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys. I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos. Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute. Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there. Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke. No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything. OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. Happy birthday dad. Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom. Are we still on that? I'm a twinkie. Oh, this is so hard. Maybe we should just tell your parents first. God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean. Alright. You remember that video I found of mom and dad? Well, I just caught the live show. Hey there. Nothing, I just heard something nice about you. Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone. Well, uh, he's a doctor. No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. Mom, it's OK. Dad, I'm the twinkie. Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . . Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man. Yes. Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier. Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom. So, are you sorry that I told them? Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see. No he went out to get pizza. That's great. Yes. I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore. Wow Joey, this is, uhh... Art it is. Joey, promise me something. Never call me from that phone. Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom. Blow drying what, you have no hair. Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again . GET OUT YOU DUFUS!! I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain. Shut up. Cut it out. But I thought you wanted to live by yourself. I promise you, he would definitely want you back. I was. Did she leave a number? I don't have her number, butt-munch. I'm not a baby, you're the baby. You wanna get out of my face? Give me that. Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy? I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight. It's my TV. Bite me. Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me. OK, what're we gonna do about this? Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here. I just can't stand you being here all the time. Fun? Fun, you think this is fun? Ross, I hated you when we were kids. Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts. Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way. Duh-huh! Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to. Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off. Then I won't have to kill you. Yeah, thanks. You know what? If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can. So what're you gonna do? Sure. They won't take you to the vet. Joey. What about the part where he has rabies? Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves. Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing. Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look. Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard? I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What? C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh. So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay. Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him? So'd you guys have fun? Really? So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do? Ross. Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here? You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard. So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache? You're meeting Richard? Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys. With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia? So you watched the movies huh? Alright, you wanna feel better? Ok, here, watch this. So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in. There's a game? Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other. Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks. Oh, then go Vassar. Ok, then just go. Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them. It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do? I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys. Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Christmas candles. Did you like it? Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table. Score! Now can we go? Um-hmm. Nighty-nite. So are you ok? Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball. Yeah, well they suck too. 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting. Really. His indian name? Wow. Weird, weird. Why? It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries? How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank. I don't want a beer. Hey, I went up. My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it. Put all my money in me. What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock... selling store. I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo. Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done? Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY. Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy. MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down. DON'T...be too long with the phone. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. I've gotta get back in the game. I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it. Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks? But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs. So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon. What? You wanna be in charge of the food committee? Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want. Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk. Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper. Joey that is horriable. So what happened? Well, how bout just her mom? Cause I already invited her. Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert. Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here? No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye. No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey. Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus. Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place. Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area. Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross. Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall. Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now. Just go. Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out. Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going? No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker. Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny. What? I don't see anything. Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament. You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here? Phoebe. Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun. Ok will do. So glad you came. Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye. Thank you. Ok everybody, it's time for flan. Ok, that's enough. Oh, I ordered mine first. Give it to me. Give it to me. There you go, enjoy your coffee. Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow. That'll teach you to lick my muffin. Had it. Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp. Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown. Just waiting for you sweetie. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine. If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy. Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner. I'm just easing you in. Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you. Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. You look fabulous honey, you really do. It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt. This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands. It's for their own good. Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular? Very good. You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks. I'm gonna set them to my time. No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why? No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now. No. See you don't understand. No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things. Oh yeah. Alright, well tell me one of yours. What if they get mixed up? You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing. What's up? Yeah? No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed. No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed. Alright, go on. Oh my God, you're a freak. Then what's the problem? What, forget it! Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on. Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. Woo-hoo, stuud! Woo-hoo, geeek! Please! Bye sweetie, I love you. What are you talking about? What wedding? Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?' Could not be more terrified. Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is. Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future? Yeah, am I in it? Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky. Keep talkin'. Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner? Not a basset, a bassinet. Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future. Uh-huh. That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs. So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about. Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will. You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do. You'll do what? Oh my God! Really? You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.' Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one. I know you do. Me too. So what now?
