Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket. Oh man! I did it again! What? That's what it sounded like. Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so. Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true. Harder than it sounds. Isn't it? Umm, listen there's something I think you should know. Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him. Feeling a little better sweetie? Me too. Hey! How are you doing? Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really! Chandler! So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow? Oh, great! Bye Dan! Great! Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him. I think you're better than you think you are. Know when to stop. Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance. I think you're my favorite. I don't care. Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing! Come in. I've been waiting for you. Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap. Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha! Uh-huh, that one! Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross. But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily? Vomit tux? Who vomited on, y'know what, what you up to Joe? Oh that's great! What's wrong with PBS? Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet. I might've said that. Why is that funny? Hey! That's great! What?! But you live here! You know that. Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife. Sure! Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend. Great! What?! You can't, what did you tell her? Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife. No, you cannot. Hello. Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV? You're not on TV. Hi Chandler. Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day. William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27. Yeah, so? Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass. Why? A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy! All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me. Keep talking. Really? Well, if we owe it? Oh my, When is Joey gonna be home? But, I just cleaned the bathroom. Yeah. Okay. Ow! I know! Never done that before. Hi! Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like. I'm really getting tired of sneaking around. All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked. Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey! Wait! What about Joey? Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey. Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont. Hey. No, she's out shopping. Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work? Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing? Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles. Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry. Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that! Come here. Okay, be right back. We're switching rooms. No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we? We're switching rooms again. This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room. Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second? Chandler! Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers! Okay, this one I like! Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas! We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? What did you say? Hi! Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second? Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food. Chandler! Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half. 300 dollars?! Urghh!! Chandler stole a twenty from my purse! Maybe I could do it. Hey. You're not gonna be phased out! Hi. Yeah, it did. What? Why, exactly? Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than... Ohhh! You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about. Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! I'm afraid so. Hey! Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator. Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine. Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows! Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell. I know, it's great! Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count. Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs. Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something! Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh! What?! Sorry. Rachel's at work. Hey, what's that? What is that? This is all of your things. So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever- used sale. Now calm down Joey. Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that? Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron. All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison? Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him! We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man! And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him! Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog! We're-we're really sorry we fogged you. Yeah. Wow! That guy is so rude! Well you did a little bit. I totally forgive you! Yes! Hey! Crematorium Chris? Sure! Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated. No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy. God, I feel so guilty about Ross. Whatever you decide, whatever you do. Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner. Hey, look at you! Where have you been? How did that happen? I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready. Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together. I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head! Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering. Oh, Larry. Okay, knock yourself out, Larry. Larry? Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen. It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it. Thanks. Hmm? He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try... Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married. Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again? Ohh, fun! Well, I guess we won't be warming his house. And you're not gonna do that. So-so there is no party. I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you. Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by. You are? Okay. What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it! Great. So the ball is in his court? Hey! I don't know, clean places? It's Danny. We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later? The fake kind! We have a ladle. Okay, great! Just go over and say hi. Hey, Danny! Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this? Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this? Oh. I thought there wasn't a ball? I think I need a drink. Phoebe, you have to lift it and point. That's very nice. Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong? Oh, let's not tell this story. Hey! Hey, did you get the turkey basted..Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that? What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny? Well, get it off now! Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head! Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time! Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3! That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving. Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story. Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story! I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving! Well, I do. Yes, it was! Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?! Hi, Chandler. What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner. Well it didn't! Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh! How? What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him! Yeah. And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him! Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him? What do you mean? I can do that! Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek. Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body. Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that... Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! What?! What is it? God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it! Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche! I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident. I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe! Chandler! Chandler, I said I was sorry. Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything? Wait, wait, wait! Look! I bet this will work! What? You said you loved me! I can't believe this! Yes, you did! You love me! Yeah! Thank you Joey, thank you so much! Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot. We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret. We are! Help us! Joey! Hey, Phoebe! Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but Phoebe, you are a bad ass! Phoebe? Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller. We're so sorry. Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time. Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. I know. Ross, are you okay? Why?! A pill? Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work? I know! I know! I know! Give me that! It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease! Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff! Oh no! Yes it's true. I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir. I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey. I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants. All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week! Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!! You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at, right? Do you want to go out on a date with her? Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait. Phoebe! I just wanted to see how it's going. Well good, here let me help you out. Yeah! Yeah. I guess. Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? Hey, what's up? Oh, honey, I'm sorry. You had no relationship!! Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl. Come on, hurry! No. No. Eww!! Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets. Hey! All the time. In fact, I was undefeated. Still, I was quick as a cat. Oh, you're kidding. We don't, we don't wrestle now. Too strong for me? You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? Ready? Wrestle! That was unbelievable! Hi, how are you doing Kelly? It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it? This is disgusting! Oh no, wait! Joey! Happy New Year. She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us. Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less. Well if Ted Kopel talked about his co-workers botched boob jobs, I would. Hi Ben! I like 'em. I like them a lot. It's my New Year's resolution! No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures. Thank you. I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big... We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry. Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy! See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something. Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry. Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating? I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide. Ooh, and I can do this. Hi, nice to meet you! What was that? That noise you just made? Really? Your work laugh? All right, check me out. Really? Hey, I thought you already had one. Hi! What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day. Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good. Okay. Umm... Okay, what's going on with you? Well, I-I...there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore. Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about? Game! Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved! I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said. Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills. They have racquets don't they?! I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do. I got it! I got it!! I can't believe you let them win! I was frustrated. I was frustrated with you! Y'know what really bothers me? Is...it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up. I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night. Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!! My turn? What-what are you talking about? What?! Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out. Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big.....ot. Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes. Me and Chandler?! Oh, none for me. Thanks. How does that laugh not give you a headache? Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things. I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect. Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke. Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey? I thought you could use the help. Sorry! I'm just...I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel! I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend. Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel! Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.] Okay great! Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it! Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work. Okay. I'll get back to my new job. I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica! That was a half an hour? Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages! It's so good, isn't it? Say good-bye to sore muscles! Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside. Ohh my God, I'm so sorry. Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die? What?! What honey? Oh, did you catch him?! All right, let's go say good-bye. Well, at least you scared someone. Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you. What are you talking about? I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! No he's not! What?! You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that. But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society. No. Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me...just say, "I don't like your massages." See? It's no big deal. I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work. My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages. Oh my God! You don't know me at all! I'm crying here!! Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that? So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica? Okay. I suck! Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag. You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute? Okay, now you're even cuter!! What? What are you talking about? That's not possible! I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way. I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her. This bicep? Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry. Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me? Okay. I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters. Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it? Well what did you send? Bye! Actually, I did! Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it! Them?! Who's them? Joey! Unless... Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So... Look at them, they're-they're panicked! Oh yeah! All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out! Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do! Because you're on my team! And my team always wins! Just go get some! Go! She's bluffing! You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks! Of course. I love you too Chandler. Well actually, Ross doesn't. What are you doing?! Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro? I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too. Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us. But what? In that cute, little, sweet way she just did? I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool? Isn't this great? Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever? Are you okay? What-what are you doing? Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!! Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff. Oh and you know what I want! I do not have baby fever! Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap! You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! Gunther, can I get a coffee to go? I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you. What?! Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. I'm Monica. Okay. Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?! No-no, don't-don't-don't do it! Chandler, why are you doing this? Chandler. Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry? Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds. Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now! Who? Two divorces and Joey?! Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that. Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes? Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time. Hey! Yes, you are so smart! I know. Wow! Hey. Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay? I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you. Are you saying I smell bad? What's with him? Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back! Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. What is going on with you? What was the dream about? Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me! No! Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too. Um-hmm. Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend! You become friends after? That's right. Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first! What about the closeness? Who is it? Let me try. Did I squeeze it too hard? Is he doing his shark attack bit yet? Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up! Wow! She is pretty, huh? What happened? No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. What? Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh? I know it is the best. What? It's still going on. I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time. What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!! Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire! You are so cute. Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview! Yes! A kiss? What are you talking about? He probably wants you back because you're right for the job. Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight? What are you doing? Oh, we're not seeing a movie! Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second? Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second? Okay. We have got to beat them! 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are! So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong! Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner. We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best. No, you're the best. I am the best. Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day? Why? What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left! No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong. You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean? Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair. You didn't! The park huh? A public place. I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! Hi Chandler. Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you? Come on, we can't let them win! Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off -each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase! I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore. Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time? Really? That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way. Yeah. Did not. Okay, I freaked out a little. Thank God! I can't watch him anymore! Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me. I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends. I would love to do it together! It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad. That doesn't seem fair. Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air. Hey! Yeah, me too! All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food. Oh, we're not doing that. Okay... What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do! Cups. And ice! Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant... Hey! How'd the audition go?! Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?" You got a callback too didn't you? How did work go? You stink! No, I'm-I'm serious! That's so gross! Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. Why don't you just go out with her! Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones! Y'know...go! Go! Right there! That's the surprise! Hey! Happy Anniversary! So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London... Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't? That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready. That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special. You have got to go home! You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight. Great! Rach? What are you doing? It's a diaper commercial. What's goin' on? It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine. It's no big deal, I do it all the time. Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you! Chandler, this actually bothers you? What? Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over. No you didn't. Yeah, it's good. Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me. Go on, teach me something about men and women. No way! Well that's pathetic! And this goes for all guys? No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here! Phoebe! Yeah, what is it? Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it. All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose. Look at you! Come here! Feel better? That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses! Yes! What about these? These look the same? Not as each other! Hi! Yeah. Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier. Oh, honey, the earrings... My boyfriend really does have good taste! Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it. Hey! Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos! Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know....And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? You can also find him under umm, dog and dead. All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one. I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype. All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash. Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around... What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! Rach! It's me! Pick up! I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila. See if he has ice. Nooo! Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that! We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you? I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him...help him? No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people. Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him. All right, I guess we should go. Oh yeah right! There's nothing we can do. You erased the message! Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it. Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away! Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys. No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea. So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh? Oh my God! I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her? I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral... Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!! He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer! Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you! Ohhhh! That is so sweet! Hey guys! Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it? All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work! Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it! What?! Really?! I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. Rach? You have scratches all over you, what happened? What?! I don't want a cat! What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!! No-no! Don't do it! Don't! He's a dropper! Oh my...Oh good God! So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it? Rach, why won't they take it back? Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it. Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close. So you're moving in with him. What happened? Why, do you write him a lot? Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time! Please! I made this game what it is. All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me? All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later. Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls! Wow! You made a profit! All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive! It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball! Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor. Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice! It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good. Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? Bye! Why are so mad at him? Well, it just seems that... Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go. Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment! No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!! Oh that's an eye removal machine. I'm kidding! I'm kidding! A small puff of air, now come on! Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head. Okay. Dr. Miller? P E C F D. I sure do! And you don't get one! They're still in my coat. I love you. I wanna say good-bye at the car! Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who! Chandler! What are you doing here? Not even close. Okay! All right! Let's do it! Sit down. Put your head back. All right. Now, open your eyes. How many fingers am I holding up? Oh my God, I was thinking four. Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay? No drops! Okay. On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet! Then why did you move?! All right, come here! I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes. Damn! It's empty! Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it. What did you do to his sweater vests? Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry. Hello? Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star! Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it? Go!! Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours. Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long? Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard. The Richard. Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache? It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him. Really? The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all! Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that. I know. What? It's almost our anniversary! I got you a present! I know, but you have to open it today! Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas! For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary. No. Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary! But we can go, right? Okay! Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets! Aww! I love you! Okay! I love the "I forgot the present" fake out! Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back. Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary. Really?! Great! Phoebe, you don't eat animals. Who are you talking too? I'm so sorry. I knew you were not okay with that. It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me? You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you. I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you. I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do! Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you. Fine! Happy Anniversary! No it is not! Thank you. I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever! This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again. Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! Anybody lose this? Hmm. All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire! Wait Chandler, what are you doing?! What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me! Not any more. Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty. Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long. We have one. A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes! That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now? Pick a number! That is your only job! Thank you! Yes! We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we? Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now? What? Okay. All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich...Me neither! Okay, what do I want now? Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8! Shut up!! It just got interesting! What did you just say? Are you serious?! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you. Okay! Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way! That could be a four or a five. It's your call. I think so too. Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. You're so efficient. I love you! No-no-no! We need something old! That'll work! Okay, now we just need something borrowed! That's stealing! Ohh. Yep, we wanna get married! What are you doing? No, only because that's the graduation song. Are you sure you wanna do this?
