Shoot! We're out of soda. Really?! Sweety, what are you talking about? Oh. Ennnh. Ow!! Ow!!! Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!! It's like two miles! Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish! What?! What is it?! What?!! Gross!! Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!! Nothing, I don't know. Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower. Pass the cheese, please. My God, you can't even look at me! Can you? What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me. No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell! All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk. I was in too much pain. You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... You bet. Hey!! Gin. Will you stop! Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me. Yesss!! Shhh! Chip, is Chip Matthews. 'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute. I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! Hey! Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews? What, that little thing at the prom? Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you? Look, you and I went to different high schools... You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made. It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes. Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat. Oh, really?! I'll try. Why can't you use the phone in here? Ross, don't start. Oh, but it's made her so happy. He is right, isn't he? Hi! Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there. Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Oh my God! You still have the Chipper! That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind. Wow! A lipper from Chipper. Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you? Is that all? Ohh, how is he? Isn't he an architect now? Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work? I do? You still work at the multiplex? Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents? Oh my God! What happened? Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school? Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school. No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews. I know! Hey, we can take her back with you if you want. Me too. How desperate am I? I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her. Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect. You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you. Doing great, the quiches are coming along. Yeah, I thought it was cute. Let me ask you a question. Why did you hire me? Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good. Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good. I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. What? Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them. Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God! Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one. Then why are you laughing? What? You bet I’d lose a nail? Frozen lasagnas? You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was. You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase. That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. No! You have lasagnas! Hi. Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change. Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on. What? All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make. Well? Really?! Yes!! And you? So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you.... Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word. Wow! That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails. Hello, Chandler. Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden? Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? Rachel! You just put an empty carton back in the fridge! Have you ever taken out the trash? Third door on the left. God! If you`re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.] Joey, please don`t do that. I think it`s best that we just forget about it. My God! Is this a gym card? What`s the matter? So do them for free. Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up. You`re gonna do some feet flirtin`! What a minute, what did he say? I told you not to go down there! Rachel always cries! Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you`ve never sucked before! His dancing partner?! Oh, would you let it go already?! You`re fine! Wait, now so you joined the gym? Well, you could actually go to the gym. Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself. Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet? Yes you did! You did like a little hop. You know the words! You are so into this! All right, then show me some manly moves. So you didn`t leave the bank? Oh my Gosh! Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen? Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there. Just be yourself. But, not too much. That cold makes you sound so great. Y'know what, I like Kathy. Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14? Hey! Rachel's not here. How's it going with her? Hi, Josh. So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.) Very! It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother. Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was. Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia. Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold. Ross isn't here. What? Why? Thank you so much Phoebe. What are you doing with those?! Sorry, Phoebe. Umm. Ohhhh!! Gross!! No, sorry. Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops? Ross, cough drops, please? You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job! And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is -stealing-from-me!' That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops! Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her? Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people. Sixty guests. Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way. I don't know. Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff. Well, you're not working either. Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you! Hey! Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident! Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order! Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that. Okay. Oh, is everything in the car? No. I hate this part. No, that's not mine. Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen. Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of... Just the matter of ...payment? Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant. What? Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking? Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me. Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go! I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event. Oh, that's great! Congratulations! Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did. And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners. Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together! I can cook and you can take care of the money. Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister. Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it? No? Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound. He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound." Yeah! Boy, that was-that was, umm=85 terrific. Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement! Y'know, there`s a Starbucks about three blocks down. Hey, aren`t you up next? Phoebe, Ross sucks! Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too. Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever! Are you serious? You obviously haven`t screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate. He loves you. I remember you did. What? Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time. We haven't eaten yet! Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller. Who cares? He works in a museum! What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!! Oh my God, ice just got in my eye! Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills. No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend! Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7. Yes!! Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor? Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now. I was probably waiting for it to open. You look great too. So how does it look? Like a pirate?! Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him. Oh. Big family dinner tonight? No way! Oh. Oh. Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie? I know. Why is it sick? Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you? Me going out with Richard's son. Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim. Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. And Joey. My brother, Ross. And Rachel. And that's Chandler. Umm, well, he's.... All right everybody, this turkey is ready! Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap. See he's nice. Right? I saved you a seat. Oh-ho-ho, we've got company. Ooh, this always happens. Thank you. Y'know all my friends think this is weird. I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing. We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right? Nothing. Nothing. No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a good kiss. Don't say it! Yeah! I know! Oh, he's catching up to her! Come on, no peeking! All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though. Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything? Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter. Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence, dozens of people. Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners. Oh. All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van? Hey! My first review is out! All right, look at my on the back page. Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends. Oh! Do you need me to go with you? Haven't we made this decision? Bye! Who is it? Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone! Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away. No! Phoebe! I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books. The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants! All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery. Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from? Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them. Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!! Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen! You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me? Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering. I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know? I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's. It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business. All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van. Phoebe, wait a minute! Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out. I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person. Or! A bakery delivery person. Pizza?! All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver. Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either. Y'know what, let's do the catering business. Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun. Really?! Thank you. ' Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me? Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me. I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat. I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life. I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation. That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter? All right, you're hired! Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin? All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that? You want a problem? I'll give you a problem! You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you. Hey. They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight. What are you doing?! Thanks. I think you got it! Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese? Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag. Why is nobody writing these down? Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night? Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere. A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?! What the hell happened?! Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you! What kinda things have you been saying? I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish? You did a minute ago! Fine! Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! That's not funny. I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is.... You do? Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem! You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now? How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now? Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut! Thanks. Enough! No, you've messed it up. You're stupid. Are you serious? What did you tell them? Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant. We just want you to think it through. In the beginning, you know, where it's all sex and talking and sex and talking... And the sex? Then what is it? Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed. Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The sex is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love. I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. What? So, did you do it? Uh-oh, was it bad? Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time. All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. All right. Now... Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, one, two, three, , four , five, six, and seven. Kind of an important one. Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp. All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes. Okay, you could, uh, start with a little one; a two; a one, two, three; a three; a five; a four, a three-two; a two, a two-four -six; two-four-six; four a two; two; four-seven; five-seven ; six-seven; seven, seven, SEVEN, SEVEN, SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN- SEVEN-SEVEN! You know, I never saw that. What are you doing? It's going to be so great. Would you surrogate? What if I asked? Really? No. Boy, you are really not a morning person. What kind of changes? Oh, good luck. That is sooo not true! I just, I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you. Yeah. Deal! Ha-ha! Aww, man! That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch. Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks. Are you scared? Ross will do it. You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant? Same category? Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance! No!! I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head! Viva Las Gaygas! You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds. Huh, wanna bet? How about we play for more money, say 150? You're doing it again. We won't. 300? I'm just trying to spice it up! I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster? Deal! Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me. Come on! Come on! Sandwiches! Maurice. And processing. It's umm, it has something to do with transponding. That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this! NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something. Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment! How do you feel? Really?! How much?! Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right? All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault. Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week! Well? It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time. Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box? I'll take care of it. I lost our mattresses. Hey! Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop. Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong! I can't find garbage bags! What is it?! I can't believe we're living here! Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just, throw your purses at it. Oh my God, are you out of a job? Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended. If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now. What are you doing? Hey! You made pancakes? Okay. Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game. The players. Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is. Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven! Please, have some! Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone. Yeah, it's just something I picked up. Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out! No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too! People are supposed to wanna hang out here! I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air. 'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough. All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place! Are you sure? Nah, I got it. Okay, it's ready. Come on. Just come. Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor? You used to have carpet. So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit. Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess. Hey umm, what's this? Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week? What's Phase Two? You stink! Uh-oh, what's the matter? I don't know sweetie. I can't! I have to work! No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell. I think she's here. Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello! I-I-I think you look great. What? Oh my God! Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink! Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell. So? How did it go with Joshua last night? What? So you hit her in the face? Hey! You're wearing pants! It's 9:30 in the morning! Hello. Oh, hey Ross! Oh-oh, my God! Shh!! Wait, what? He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont! He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard. Why do you care so much anyway? Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail. A couple of days. What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase! Yeah, come on, we can be guys! Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties? Very good, so good. When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris. Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy. I think somebody needs another lap dance. So, we did okay at the strip club, right? What, he doesn't like Josh? Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too. Come on! Chandler! They really were pretty, weren't they? Oh, Candy! She was so spunky! Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite. Oh, Chantal! Really?! That's-that's not Phase Three. Hey! Wait, now, what am I doing again? Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do? Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did? They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care? Janice?! How have you been? Done? This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is. Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? He asked you out?! Saucy! Electrical plans for the building. I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours. Hi! Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think? No-no-no, no! I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture. Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something! I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did. No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs. But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus. All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up. I guess Joey was right, it does nothing. Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes. Um-hmm. Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup. Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke. So, you wore your nightie to dinner? Oh, no! Emily’s straight. This totally makes sense! Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you! This is so much fun! Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily. Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did. Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live! Okay. Shut up! This place is a hole! Hey! Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game? Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats. Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid? What do you say? Have you even had a girl up here? All right boys, last chance for the tickets! All right, so what do you say? Oh, just do it!! They’re green? That’s not even a game! You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say? Oh, good. Okay. Four. Because we won our apartment back! No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four! But, we pick again! We pick again! I don’t know! We’ll discuss it, in the morning! No, we’re not! We’re not leaving! As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute. Men are such idiots. Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true. What-what’s going on? When, when did, how, how did you... I can’t believe you’re getting married! Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee! He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud? Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over..... He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring. Have you guys picked a date yet? Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with, I’ll do them when I get home! I’ll pick it up for you! Okay. Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful! Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold. Emily Waltham. Okay. I am, aren’t I? Yes? All right. Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second! Phoebe? Can you just hold on for one minute? Are you alone? All right. Okay, ready? Okay. Congratulations! Okay! My turn! My turn! Yeah. That was a terrible throw!! Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we? This isn’t even my dress. I’m changing out of this. In like a half-hour? Okay, throw it straight this time. I’m getting married next!! Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly? Oh God. Hey! So, is Joey gonna stop snoring? No, seriously. Oh my God! Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are! Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again. Again. Y’know what? I think we all did. Hey! Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be. Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date! No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us! Rachel?! Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic! Hey! I never knew that either. We’re hanging out. I’m sorry honey. Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you? You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay? I can't believe he did this. You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom. Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds. Oh, dad, turn it off. If you're not going then I don't want to go either. I can't believe you did that. Nooooo. You’re really not going? You don’t have a car. And your license expired.
