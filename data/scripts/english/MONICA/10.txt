Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
What's up?
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
I'm not sure about this.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
What?
Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
Thank you.
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
I'm on it!
I think I hear curtains closing...
Bedsprings, unmistakable!
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
Check it out!
What do you think?
Don't you just love it?
And listen to this...
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
Yeah!
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
It's "Bolero" from "10".
You what? You said you liked them.
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
And the eye!
Not really.
I have a problem.
Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
Oh, well, I can move...
I guess so...
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Sure, what do you have in mind?
Really? I don't really feel like it.
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Hey.
That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
That's not really how it works.
I don't know!
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
Hi Frank.
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Which one is which again?
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Oh my god!
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Can I adopt you?
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Hey, Phoebs
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
What?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Hey!
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
So glad you came!
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
Alright, 5 more minutes.
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Ok, ten.
Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Everybody get your toys!
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
What are you barking at?
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
Game?
That's how old you are.
Ooh, I want one...
...and head to Canada!
I wasn't. Let's get going!
What about your massage client?
Thanks!
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Thank you!
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Clearly we were wrong.
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Wow! Don't you look nice?!
You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
It doesn’t make any sense.
Alright, what was this sentence originally?
Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
Thank you.
How about at a game, on the big screen?
What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
No, sorry sweety..
You dropped it off?
You hand-wrote it?
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Okay good.
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
What?
They thought Joey was a child?
Hey, what did you guys do today?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
I'm a cool, fun aunt!
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Oh, right.
Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Damn it, I did not think this through!
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Wow, what's the bad news!
Huh!
You know, I would give her up, for you.
But I want to.
But I insist!
No, that landed in your food!
Oh, my!
I like that poster!
Are you still here?
Hey! I sold that to Joey.
No, too late. You can't give it back!
No you can't. She's yours!
SHE'S YOURS!
She's m-i-i-ne!
She's mine!
She's mine!
She's mine!
Oh my God!
We?
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Chandler?
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
It isn't mine!
Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Ok.
We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Yay!
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Would you like something to drink?
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
Really? What is it?
Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
Why don't I show you the baby's room?
So that was the baby's room.
What room should we see next?
Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! .
Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Hey guys!
We need to talk to you about something.
No, it's not!
Thank you, Pheebs!
What? You are way off, lady!
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Did someone drop the baton again?
I don't get older. I just get better!
You don't know that.
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Name one of his books.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Do you hear something?
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Nothing. It's fine.
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Stinky?!
Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
It's too late for apologies.
The three of us?
Joey, that is not gonna work.
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Bring it.
Here you go!
Okay, try it.
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Chandler, where are your tools?
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Oh!
Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
I don't care.
That was the adoption agency...
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Hey!
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
And a lot could still get in our way.
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Uh, we're gonna be great.
Well... obviously!
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
I don't know about that.
Let her finish, doctor.
Amen.
Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
We don’t?
Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Why not?
God works in mysterious ways.
But she liked us.
Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Please.. please, we are so close.
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Technicality!
I-Is... Is that a picture?
Look, doctor!
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
God bless you Chandler Bing!
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Sex!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Nancy doesn’t smoke!
So? What do you think of the house?
Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Don’t you love the huge yard?
And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
So? Do you think we should get it?
I think we should.
This is huge!
How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
What?
Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Every year.
Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Deal!
Maurice.
It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
That’s not even a word!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
She really left.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
And?
We can't afford that.
Well, there you go.
Yeah, we'll be okay.
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
What?
Oh my God!
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
And a baby...
We sure are.
Not it!
Rachel, this is yours.
All right, everybody open them!
I know.
Enjoy!
Hey, let me tell them!
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
"I'm a little bit country"...
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Who is it?
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
...If-you-say-so.
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
I KNOW!
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
Oh THATS ME!
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
What? When was this?
Oh my God! That's wild!
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
OH! Oh, oh!
YES!
I was the pile of coats!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
You were my first kiss ever?
Well, it matters to me!
Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
You don't know military time?
Just subtract twelve.
Six o'clock!
Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Ooh... she backed out.
I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
What?
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Hi.
She's in her room, why?
I know.
Bye.
Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
How's it going?
What?
Really?
You really want me to come back?
Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Well, the club lost it's power.
AFFIRMATIVE!
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Really?
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
So, you're ready to do this?
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Hey.
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Hey.
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
Hey!
These are for Erica!
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Honey.
Hey you guys.
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Joey. Erica, baby!
Everyone. Erica, baby!
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
What is with you?
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
How's that now?
Was he falsely accused of something?
Are you awake?
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
How?
Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
No it's not.
The thing we never do.
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
No one wanted seconds, right?
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
See you guys later.
I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Hey Pheebs.
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Phoebe!
You seriously changed your name to that?
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
No it's not!
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
Joey, we know that's you.
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Hey, where have you been?
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
No.
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Oh, sorry!
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Here, let me help you.
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
From?
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Hey! Where's Mike?
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Yeah.
Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Rachel used to live in that room.
Joey's bare ass!
Yeah?
Sure.
No.
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
You're the best friend I ever had.
What?
That is so sweet.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Yeah. Mine too.
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Uh, where do you think you're going?
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
You did? How?
Oh my God! Let me see.
Nana liked it rough!
Erica, are you okay?
Oh my God!
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Erica, are you okay?
Oh my God!
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Alright, I'll be right back.
To use the bathroom.
What?
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
It's just a little bit more, honey.
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
It's a... It's a boy!
Oh, you did it!
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
We only ordered one!
Wait, did you know it was twins?
Anybody tell you?
This is unbelievable.
What do you mean "what do we do"?
Chandler, you're panicking!
We can't split them up!
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Okay!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Son of a gun, it is!
Okay, well, bye!
We'll call you!
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
Okay.
Alright, let's see..
Yeah, I'm good.
Yes, it's twins!
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
I love you.
Call us when you get there.
Now, that you can do.
Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Oh God! What did I just step on?
Oh..
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Hello.
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
Isn't that cute?
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Hey! Did you find them?
Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
Alright. My job here is done.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
I know.
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
This is harder than I thought it would be.
We got some time.

Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive... I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job. How is that gonna happen? You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron? Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't. But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look? That's terrible! Joey's gonna be *so* upset. Seriously, you don't think we should tell him? What if he reads it in the paper? Thanks. Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole! Love it! They could be our neighbors, what are they like? No, actually, we're buying the house next door. I don't know why. Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will. Okay, Okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house. Okay, you come up with an idea. But we love our house. Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
