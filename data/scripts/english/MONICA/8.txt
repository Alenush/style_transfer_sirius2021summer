Okay. Guys! I’m not pregnant. You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?! Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party. Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. Because I’m not. What are you talking about? Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?! Yeah! Why?! Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us. Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket! No. What?! Oh that is so sweet! Yes. What’s the matter? Well, are you going to be able to do this? Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us. Oh sweet Lord. Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey! Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?! This is so huge. Of course not nothing is. Between me and you… …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant? How? Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own. Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be. Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years? Are you okay? Oh really?! Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant. How do you feel? Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right? You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me. Okay. Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?! Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present. Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor? Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go. Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna… Go ahead Rach. Well… Well, great. Oh God… Are you really gonna do this? That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife! Oh yeah, right. That’s not ‘til Thursday. They won’t be ready for weeks. That’s true! I knew I married you for a reason! Okay. Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to. Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night! Hey! No! But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is? A tiny salt shaker!!! Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun. Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them. Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think? Or this one! Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness? No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant. Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen. What was that bam? Who’s David Lynn? No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay? Give me one more. Oh my God! Joey! You can’t marry him! Phoebe! She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant. Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months! There’s a dude? People have got to finish their stories! I don’t know how any of these got opened?! I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again! Yeah. What is that? Hey! How’d it go? So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? What?! Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! Let’s stay in the kitchen! Wow! That is a great picture! Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! That would be a good idea. You kissed another woman! Okay! Yeah I am! That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone. Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo. Hey! Thank you. This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt! Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood. Well, what were you gonna say? Hey! Good luck! Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby. I didn’t think you could keep it a secret. They’re kissing let’s just go around them. I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion. Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, "Next." Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon. Grab my ass! Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon. Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class? You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit! Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there? Me neither! We have to get in! Oh my God! Oranges! Fine. Go! Go! Go! I can’t believe we’re here. What? No!! You have been screwing us all day! Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon! What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas! Well do something! Get in there! Yeah! Do that! No! Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on! You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? Hi sweetie! Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back. No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too! Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call. I know. This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship. We didn’t get anything for anyone. That you can have. It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby! Oh great! All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen? Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em. Hello? Eighth street deli? Uh sorry, wrong number. Hello? It’s the deli again! I don’t think this number’s right! What?! People don’t do that! They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that? And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot! Yeah, definitely. I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number. Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names. I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! What about my questions? Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke? Hell yeah!!! Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine. I know. You used the Europe story! Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… That is their old number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved! Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y’know what Greg? Y’know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can’t see that then… January 15th? We’ll see you then! Okay! Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe! Hey how was dinner?! Okay! Okay! Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef. Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto? All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad. All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? You’re single. You’re single. He gets off work at eleven. She’ll be waiting for your call. I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar. Hi! I…I have to fire him. Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire! Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished. All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there! I paid to have this done. Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go! No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!" Why not?! What?! You said he was sweet! Just don’t pick up your phone. What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him? Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week. Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it! What do you mean? I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first. Hey. Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe? Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. Phoebe! You’re fired! You’re fired. Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right. Tim wait! Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again. Yeah. Okay.
