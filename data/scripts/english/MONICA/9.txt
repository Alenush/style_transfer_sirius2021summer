What are you talking about? We're all together right now. Oh, dear God! Hey! Hmhmm. This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner. Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there. Welcome home. I've missed you. Join me in the bedroom? OK, so you wanna play it that way, do you? You don't need a shower. What do I smell? I smell smoke. Hon, did you smoke?  How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad where the little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling. So what? Don't you have any will power? You said that was sexy! That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again. Um-hm. Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now. Yes. Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex. Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and if we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month. Oh yeah! Huh, and no cuddling. Oh good, I hate it when you do that Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby. Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral... No, you're right. We shouldn't do it like this. Huh. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, it's not the end of the world. Yeah. Do you want to? Okay. You know what? Let's not talk. Ooh, I am still so mad at you for smoking. Oh, blah blah blah blah. I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting. That's right, I got mine. Happy birthday! Well, we had a little fight. You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How come you didn't get a bigger table? ...You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck. Why would you do that? Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town. Um, you see, I'm ovulating. Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough. Bye. So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try? We don't have much time. Once the egg decends into the ovaries .. I LOVE MY NEW JOB! YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's. Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean. Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. Maybe he didn't give you a chance. Oh, well... That had been your window. Really? The scientist guy? Continue... Phoebe! Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys? What are you gonna do? You have to tell David! Heeeeeey! Was your cabin pressurised? No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right? Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. Hi! There you are. Yeah! I think that's great! Oh... How are they? Yes... What is the end of that sentence? Yeah, so? Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey... I can't believe he's that upset about this... Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister! Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey. Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks... Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me. Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore. Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you. Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out. What do you do with your money now? Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat. Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? My dad told me. They play golf together. Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step. They just gonna love you, just be yourself. I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be You went out with Wallis Pincer? I knew you didn't get a 1400! She said WHAT? What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment? That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache? Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she THAT'S NOT ME! That bastard taped over me! I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor! Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down? No, I think we should save our china for something really special. What if something gets broken, they're so expensive. Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..  I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas. It's so unfair, you don't even like your job! It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, You're not gonna be here new year's eve?? No! Come on Ben. Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? Yeah, is that okay? No. Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant. Well, I just lost my erection. You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting. Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files! I know!!! My erection is back! Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision. Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising. Don't you want to look through the rest? You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder! I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best." I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone. "Marriage. It's not for everybody." Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller. We're gonna have sex. Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not. Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees. Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night. What are you talking about? What!? You faked it? You faked it? You couldn't have faked it! Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby? Like a month? Really, you want to wait a year? I really wanna have a baby. No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration. It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons. It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?! Yes, please! I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up! Would you stop staring at her? What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way. Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once. They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good. Take me home! Hey Rach! Ready for your birthday lunch? Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight? You were just being so nice to him! Right there! That was so fake! Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time. Does he? Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me? Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes! So this is what a stroke feels like. Hey! No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright? Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up . Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover. Again, you're welcome. No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to, Only if I don't have to get up and sing. It's just, I'm not good at singing. No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up! So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others? I'm there! You kissed him? Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that? Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing? I thought you hated him? So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy? Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross No I told you I can't. What have you heard me sing? What? Yeah I do rock that one. Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing... "Delta Dawn" Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people. Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn" "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?" "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there? I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever. Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song! And they love me! All right, watch! "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..." Hey! Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to? Oh my god. Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are... You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume! Oh, it's perfect. Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours. Yeah. No, it's not. Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant. Okay. Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here. Chandler! We're okay. I'm still ovulating. So, let's do this. Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute. Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone. Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age? Canoodling? I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so... I guess you're right. But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer? She's asleep. Chandler? What are you doing? She's asleep. Yes, but we have to be fast. Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast. Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test. Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma? Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell. Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel. Hey, did you stop by here? Oh my god, then... Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are! Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just – she loves it when I'm dramatic. No, we weren't! No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us! Unless what? Really? Let's get past the moment. Oh, honey, that's incredible! Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?" Hey! He just left. What is she talking about? Is it a good play? He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass. Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition! Hey, how did the audition go? What happened? So far so good! What's wrong? So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience. What are they? Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time. Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? You okay?! How do you know a mugger? Seriously? Phoebe, that is awful! You're mother killed herself! Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross. Well, Ross was mugged as a kid. Wonderwoman! Oh yeah! What was his superpower again? That's it. What? Yeah? So? Oh my god! Hey! What are you doing? No, that seems about right. Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house! … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. … everybody we know? Yeah. I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money? I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in. Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold. Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents. Why not? Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride. Hey Joey! Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler. Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money. But Chandler lent you money! Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills. Two thousand dollars? Yeah... Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff? You're a pig. And you can't do this. Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like" Is that a bit you guys do? We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that! I hear wedding bells. Don't you mean..groomy? I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy! So you gave in and decided to call someone? Thank you? Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad? Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok. Okay... I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger? Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change. You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler. Honey? About that? Erm...I'm going to change. I'm going to get bigger! Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too. It's kind of a package deal! I thought I was something that we both wanted! Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money. We're all sorry... Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better? Ok, you got it! Really? If that's what you want... Damn it! Rookie mistake! Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"? But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge. What are you doing? Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing? What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon! Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone. And now your cell. This is your cellphone? This is your current cellphone? Phoebe, where's your purse? No, no! Give it to me! Give it to me! I'll go in there. Phoebe come here Haha! Haha! So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door. Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping. Who's that? What are you doing here? Phoebe! Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him? Base Unit! Think Monica! Think! This doesn't concern you!! Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder. Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend . Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! I've been pretty good! Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean! You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it! Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it. Kiss him, you fool!! Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will! Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe! Excuse me? Hey, at least I knew where my guy was. You didn't hear the speech! Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless! You're... weird! Oh ! Damn it! And I blame you too. Hi, glad you could come. So, did you know Ross well? Yes, he is. Me. I look like a man?? You are married though. Ok. But ehm...what is it not? And what else is it not? Very good! What do you need it for anyway? Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself! Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars. How do you know she's gonna start talking? God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade. Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something? That was a good day! I'm parked in a garage on Morton! So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks? Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three. Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants! Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work. Alright, who wants to do it? Ok, hey Rach? Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right? Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for! I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you? You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you. Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this. Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job! Come on, lottery!! Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first. I'm sorry, idea time is over. Yeah. There are no tickets on the nightstand! Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken! Chandler, sense the tone!! Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler. Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago! When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic! Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days! Ahhh! There's the man I married!! Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you! No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them! Money! Friends... They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ... Phoebe, we lost half of them. Oh, play them! Oh God, I am so sorry honey... Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job. 131! We are on a roll, people!! Check your numbers! Make me rich! Make me rich!! Just double checking ...no, no, no... No! Hello? Hold on. It's your boss. Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you! You bet! No TV or anything! Let me see! You know what? You can have mine. Hey! So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks? Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month! Oh, honey! I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant! Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am. Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant! Why don't you take Ross? No, not if their room has two beds! Thank you! Thank you! You haven't said anything... Oh.. please! I-I welcome criticism. What musician? What are you doing here! Great! Listen Phoebe... You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but... This is kind of a classy place. Yeah. Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head. Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? What do you think brought than on? A love scene? With who? Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important. I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake. Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. It was hard! Oh... Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. I didn't say your songs were not good enough. Tiny portions? Phoebe, it's not about quantity. Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in. Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs. You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. Ok, you have to stop playing now. Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on! Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller.. I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? . Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? I'm sorry... ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird... it's empty! It sounds interesting! Yeah. No, I don't think it ever works. Why? No, no, Rachel? Who do you wanna fool around with? You can't! In the hall. You wanna fool around with Joey? Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around? Who, who are they? Both of them? Which one? Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated. What the hell are you cooking! Hey! What's so bad about that? : Ross? Is he gonna introduce us? Twenty bucks says they're married within the month. So, did you two have fun? And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI! Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec? You're not sick! Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up?? You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey! Ok, what is this? WHAT? Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof! The game's over! Take off your robe! Oh my God! Kyle Lowder! I love you! Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered. Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself. Oh my God! Chandler! Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love". Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married! We will!! Look at you with all the guys! I guess you have forgotten all about Joey? Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! That's it, just sign right on the bra . Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry. You really liked it? Oh really! No! So I got it when I was 13... Hey! No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea. That's different! I was drunk and stupid! What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them? Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision. And I can't stop you. Oh, you're so wonderful. Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess! Hi. Ok. Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out. Ok. Hi honey! Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack! I got it. Yeah, I guess. Excuse me? Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"! Chandler! I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor! Uh! Tell me about yourself, Zack! Hey guys! Dinner's ready! Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!! I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information. Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes? Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout? We're just making conversation. Yess!! Does seem pretty perfect. No. No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you. No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else. Yeah, I'm sure. That is so sweet. I love you. Adoption. I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it. So this is it, we're really gonna adopt? Oh my God, we're gonna be parents! And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived. David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air. See? Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip. Let's get you out of here!! At least you took me down with you! I guess, in time. I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone. Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David. Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. What? Why? Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again. Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed! And make sure our room isn't next to theirs . Yeah, right! Ok! See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to? Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe? I need to talk to you. Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight. What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike? Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer? Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up! This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you! I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit! Well, I hope you're happy! Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike! No, I called him. It's not gonna happen. Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike. Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go. IT'S THE HUMIDITY! You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring... BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright? I know The sun is out! Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion. Damn it! Yeah! I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!! So, what are we gonna do today? Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play! Why not? I'm not always that bad! I punched you...? ... Phoebe...? I clunked your heads together! C'mon guys, it'll be fun! But then how do we know who wins? So, we're just four losers... SUPER! OK! Sure! Got to! Aww! Hell, yeah! How much were you thinking? Make it fifty! One thousand... No... Either of you girls got a quarter? Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads! Ow, what are the chances! Ha! My point! Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table! Ah, yeah! Ah, yeaaah! AH YEAAAAH! Oh, damn it! Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl? NO, NO, NOOO! Best out of three? Serve the ball, chump! No, I have just to have two more points to beat him! I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours! Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness! That's just good sense! Aww! No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play! I can't believe it! I lost! What? Honey, you don't have to do this. But... you suck! Oh my God! You're good! Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking? Why? This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
