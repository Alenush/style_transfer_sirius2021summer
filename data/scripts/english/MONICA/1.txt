There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with! Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex. Are you okay, sweetie? Carol moved her stuff out today. Let me get you some coffee. No you don't. Rachel?! De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Who wasn't invited to the wedding. Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica... Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things... Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day! Buzz him in! Maybe. Yes! Rach, wait, I can cancel... Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? Really? Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul. Two seconds. Oh my God! My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it? -leg? You actually broke her watch? What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles? Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date? Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say? Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry... Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long? Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch! ...Yeah. Yeah, I do. I had a really great time last night. We'll talk later. Shut up, and put my table back. Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff. Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio. So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling. I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco? Well, it's like that. With feelings. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work. What for? Hey, welcome back! How was Florida? How do you do that? You know Paul? You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? I just thought he was nice, y'know? How'd you pay for them? And who pays for that? C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. You ready? Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! Well, that's it. You be okay? That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? What? I-I said you had a- Would you stop? Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. Uh, Ross. No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. What did they do to you? We're with you. We got it. Hey. Whaddya doing? Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. Let's see, today's Monday... Never. No. Not after what happened with Steve. Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out. Nope. Schhorry. I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. Do you all promise? Chandler? Do you promise to be good? Hey. It's him. Who is it? Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me. Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? C'mon! Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? Really! Hi.. how was the game? Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. ..I dunno, a little too Alan? Oh, why is it unfair? Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. I know.. it's gonna be really hard. No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. Hey. Where's Joey? Thanks. Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. Okay.. Please, guys, we have to talk. Alright, we have to talk. Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. Look, I- I could go on pretending- -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! I'm sorry.. I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. Are you guys gonna be okay? I understand. I'm, I'm really sorry. Relieved? Hi. Oh, y'know.. He said he's really gonna miss you guys. Alright. Phoebe? Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? ..Excuse me? How does she do that? Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. What's going on with you? Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember. Wow, you worked in a mine? Yeah, yeah. I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom. Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? Weeeell, it's rum, and- We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people. Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account. That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back? You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing! Ah, the other Jack. So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. ...Pheebs? No, you were right. I don't have a plan. Phoebe? Do you have a plan? Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos'? Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? Oh God. Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! I see pizza! White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt? Please tell me it's his mother. Oh, no... Light still out? Oh. Maybe they're- napping. I think he's shy. Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah! What?! You slept with Jason? Oh, that's nice! Excuse me?! Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade! Where? Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo. Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone. You could do that! Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'? Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out. Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this? What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else? Good for you, Joey. We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman. How-how did that happen? Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while. You guys, I am not that bad! That is so unfair! Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook. Why not? I could do that. Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder. STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I? Well, what's the part? Oh my God. Alright, alright, alright... For what? Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there. He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there! I warned you... Oh, you got the whole night, huh? Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie? Maybe this wasn't your shot. I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. Uh-huh! Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! Mom says it`s all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens and they have no idea when it`s coming back on. Pants and a sweater, why Mom, . . . . who am I going to meet in a blackout, power company guys, eligable looters, . . . can we talk about this later? Ok. Hello. It`s Chandler. Are you ok? What? I have no idea what you just said. Alright, I`ll go I`ll go Ok erm, senior year of college. . . . on a pool table! Oh my God, what were you doing in a library?  You did not go, come on. Come on, tell us. Outside. Why not? And that would be? Joey, what`s goin` on? About what? Oh my God, I love him. My surprise party! Ohh stop it! Joey already told me. Oh, you are not, we tell you stuff. Right, this is just Bactine, it won`t hurt. Hi. Hi. Hi. If you want, I`ll do it. Thanks! Whoa ar ar ar. I did. Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality. Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. How-how are you, Mom? What? Nothing. She is unbelievable, our mother is... Oh God! The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. I know. G'bye, Nana. Ross! We checked. A lot. Dad! You what? Define fun. ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun. That's probably what they'll say. Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? Are these the shoes? It was a really beautiful service. Wow, those pills really worked, huh? Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. That sounds like Nana. ...I can imagine. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her? How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth? Huh. Oh, I think so. Thank you. They're yours. Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. I am not wrong. No, I just talked to them. Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"? Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. You know, they're not actually supposed to have...I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right? And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma? So you're free Thursday, then. Yeah. Rache, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail? Hey, Rache, did you make your money? Rache, here's your mail. No, here's your mail. Would you just open it? We all chipped in. You owe me 20 bucks. Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What? All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. That's not a question. All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. Ah! What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes--Ross needs lumps! Why would we do that? Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. Got the keys? Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here? No I don't. No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?" The oven is on. Well then get it, get it! Joey! Can you go any faster with that? Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? I swear you said you had the keys. Why would I have the keys? But I didn't. Why? Why? Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one. Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner? Stop it, stop it, stop it! Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing! Does anybody wanna split this with me? Make a wish? W-wait. What is that? No, no, I don't. Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment? Why don't you just get a roommate? So, how'd it go? So what are you gonna be? I think it's romantic. What?! Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history! Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! Do you always have to bring him here? I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. Yeah. What's the matter? Vividly. Hi. That thing is not coming in here. I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table. Alright. Just keep him away from me. Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo? Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby! Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby! So I'm kissing everyone? Why? Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. We are not going to whistle. No! No! Woo-woo! Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'? Phoebe, what are you doing? I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer. Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance! I wish all guys could be like him. He doesn't have anyone. Last night. Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports. Nah... not-not special enough. Waaay too special. Yeah. What are you guys doing here? ...What did I ask? Hi. What are you doing here? I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me? How would I know? I-I wasn't here. Hey. 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'. Hello. No, you? You just asked me. Oh! You're awake! You look good! Oh, sorry. I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you. I got you the foot massager. I read to you. Oh, my pleasure. 'See you around'? Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, 'That was nice'? It meant something to me? 'I'll call you'? This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe. What's a 'niffle'? Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? So, did I hear Poconos? Yeah, that's a big step. And Monica knows... Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me. I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt! Phoebe, what's the matter? Phoebe, what is it? Are you sure? Was it...? Oh! So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? Heads up Ross! Score! You suck! Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either how could you? or enormous breasts! Here he comes! Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles. Oh, you're right. Ooh...hey honey, are you all right? Yes! And that would be a shut-down! Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game! You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone. Ok, look, this could be a really long game. Ross, that's my jacket. Ross, your little creature's got the remote again. Great. No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot. I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet? Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument. I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles. We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly. Goodbye Mr. Heckles. Ok, I think I get how to do this. Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right? Come on, you gotta talk to Joey. Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside? Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something. All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call? Really? Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance? I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars. There's not much we can do. No no no no no no no no no. That's insurance fraud. Ok. Ok. I hate this. Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms. I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine. Yep, that's me. I am that stupid. Yes, yes she is. Hi. Thank you. Uh, you left out the stupid part. I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates. Come on, she'll be here any minute. Well maybe we can make a "b" out of one of those roses. Rachel, the cute doctors are here. Hi, come on in. It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle. It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble. A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok? I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby. What? What? Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus? Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it. I used to wet my bed. We both do that. Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had sex on your bed. Ross, he's got the remote again. Find out what they want. Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you. We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms. Thank you. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um... I am. I'm that stupid. What's goin' on? Michael. Monica. Hi. Para mi Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el contro remoto Mail call. Rachel Green. Bunk 7. Oh good, 'cos where else would we get any? What is it? Barry who you almost...? And Mindy your maid of...? Let me see... That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty.... lucky.... to have had a friend like you! Hi! Wonderful. There was nudity! Huh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this? Wait... He pooped in my shoe? Which one? Which ones? He, he pooped in my shoe. Those cute little black ones I wear all the time. OK. We'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I will take third and fourth. OK. You stay here. You just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.  Mr.Heckles. Our, our friends lost a monkey. Have you seen it? No! The monkey? Have you seen a monkey? Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel. Phoebes? You remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Erm, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced. I, I'm Monica Geller... Louisa! From homeroom! Not at all. Oh, I'm so sorry. Alright, you know what? Be that as it may, you think you could help us out here on that monkey thing? You know, just for old time's sake? "Go Bobcats!" Marcel? Marcel? What is it? Look, Phoebe! What are you gonna do? Run Marcel! Run! Run Marcel! Are you OK? This is me in "The Sound of Music"... You see the Von-Trapp kids? That's because I'm in front of them! Well, high school was not my favourite time. Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?..... I have no idea. But look how much they spent! I know. It's just such reckless spending. That's me. Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. This woman's living my life. She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't. Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we. Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School? This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were. Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is. What d'you think? Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? Okay, I'm not getting this! Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? Great. It's gym class all over again. Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana. Yeah. It's Dutch. Um, Pennsylvania Dutch. Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit. It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! 'Scuse me? Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class. What? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. Uh-huh. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. Yo- hooo! Monica and I just crashed an embassy party. Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk. Water rules! Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today. No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana! Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. They've arrested Monica. Hi. How are you? Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theatre! I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? Well, not... worried, just... wondering. Not necessarily... Um, I'm not actually Amish. In. Yeah, but at least I'm doing it! Tell him. Just...please tell him. Look at you, you won't even look at him. Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' All right, I'll see you guys later. Thank you. He's... our age. Okay, he's a senior in college. No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22. Oh, I can't pass for 22? I am 26. Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control? What? I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things. Yeah. Did not. How was that possible? Okay. Unless-- Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so... Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat'? Ethan-- Are you a virgin? Really? You keep saying that. Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to. No no. Nothing wrong about that. Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. You're not a senior? Ok...ay. What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial. Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? Don't say it. Really? Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. I'm Joan Collins. What? Oh. No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out. Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? Aren't you gonna-- That was gonna be my opener. It was. Ethan, it's um... it's icky. This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really-- --love you. I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew. I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet? Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby? What's with the guitar? I want a baby. Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee. Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute. No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two? Oh yeah? When? Why won't I be married when I'm 40? Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? What is it?
