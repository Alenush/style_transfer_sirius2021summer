Are you sure you wanna do this? Whoa! What are you guys doing here? Why else would we be here? This is insane! What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere. Yeah! Hey. How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore. Yes I do! Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon. Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married! What are you guys gonna do? So, what do you think we should do? I know I love you! That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you! All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married. Okay. Ready? Come on eight. Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight. Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight. I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack? Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. That kid really kicked me hard on the plane. He took my snack! Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad. This doesn’t mean anything, does it? Okay. No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it! I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are! I don’t want things to change! Do you? All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane! Then all your stuff would be here. Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense. Live together? There have been no signs for that. YES!!!!!!!! Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Here’s your key Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in! Ready! Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out! No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key! Oh my God it’s old! I love you! No. Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one? Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it. Pretty much. Hi! Joey, we have something to tell you. Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?! Hey Pheebs! Hey, have you seen Rachel? I have some pretty exciting news! No! Chandler and I are moving in together! Hey! Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together. Okay, come here! Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? Ugh, I thought you were Rachel! I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left! No. Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here. Really?! Yes, we are. Yeah, he’s gonna work on that. We’ll be waiting for you... Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend! I’m not your best friend? All right, all right, at least I’m prepared. Hey! These aren’t for you! Are you upset? Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you. No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before. Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together. Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush. Okay. Don’t you want a cookie? Maybe, do you need a tissue? I made them! Hi. So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us. Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out! Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore. Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories! I don’t know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate. Something to remember me by! But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say! I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era. An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you! What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?! What’s hard to believe? Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here. No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen. Yeah, sweetie. No. I’m gonna miss you! I know! Who’s Denise? Okay listen, y’know when you move in, Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it? Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much. No. Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no. I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques. What do you have against the beautiful guest room? Are you mocking me? Hi. Stop it Chandler. I’m sorry too. Yeah! Oh yes! Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together. Totally! Oh good. Changes? You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here? Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together. See now-now you’re taking them away from their home. Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?! Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly! Ross, we can handle this. Love is the best medicine. Why do you do it? Yes. That’s very funny! Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room. Yeah, no, me neither. You still want to move in together right? Ross didn’t scare you? Come here, I want to show you something! This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen. Okay! Uh-hmm. Oh my God! I love that! Uh, no!! This bottle opener. And it’s a magnet! Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks mine? Ohh! Yeah, I forgot. That you’re a liar. Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say? Hey! Phoebe that’s crazy! Hmm? No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself. I loved them! Hey! How’d the lecture go? That you’re not funny or sexy? Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch. What the hell are you doing?! Monica Gellerrr. Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies! Gimme ‘em! You stole them from me! Gimme them! You just wanna each take one? Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America. I think you look fine. Okay, come on, do it one more time! Yes! You’re kidding! Ross! Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found? Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great! Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it. Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when......people with babies come to visit. Pheebs, how’s it going? Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler. What do you mean? This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant. Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound. I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it. And six others. Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same. Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out! Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head. How are you still single?! Good. What made you change your mind? Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes? Joey, you know you don’t actually have one. All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room. The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while! He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital. Oh my God. Phoebe, what, what happened here?! But my apartment! But the mess! You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?! Hey! Okay. Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe. It’s not your birthday. You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed. Rachel, I need to borrow... You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit! What? I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe? You’re plans were with us. All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out! Okay! Oh my God, thank you!! Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with.... I thought you said you were going to do nothing. Okay fine, now Ross.... Why not? It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he? Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! All right, sorry. Oh God! No. I’m gonna miss you so much. I don’t think there’s anything. Nope, she’s perfect. Aw, sometimes. Always, actually. Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me! What’s up? Oh, put him on! "Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!" "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" I’m not talking to her! Well, maybe you’re right. She made fun of my phone pen! Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about... What are you doing? What?! It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! Because it’s my apartment! How about, you’re moving!! I am not! No Phoebe I am mad! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?" Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots! She lets you borrow them. Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like. When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! Kinda. Oh my God! Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? I’m really gonna miss you. Thanks. Yeah. Bye. She really left. Thank you. Can I ask you a question? What the hell is that dog doing here?! Hey! Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor! Oh, So you can move them! It's nice to meet you. Janine...? Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in? Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her? Oh, so you like her too Chandler? Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated. Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble. Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt. Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green? So, Phoebe runs weird huh? Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth. I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles. We'll see. Hi! Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early. Well, are you just hanging out with Ross? What?! Why is Ross naked? Naked? Is it the same thing that Chandler had? Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye! Is it okay for me to come in now? Why is everything different? Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that. Of course! All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked? Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle. Hey guys. It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend. Yeah. No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way. I don’t think mine likes me either. We should go. What happened to your teeth. Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them. Ross they’re really, really, really white. How much longer? Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary? She will be after tonight. Oh my god. My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous. Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright. I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you. Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working. Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on. All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see. Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose. Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer. You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry. Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall. When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that. Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip. Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter. Okay, great! Bye. So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner? I miss Rachel. No, my parents. Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four. Because they don’t know we’re dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t. So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry. Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch. Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry. You really think that’ll work? I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk! Nothing. No, sweetie, I-I trust you. You’re not gonna mess it up. Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that. Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’? Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl? You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here! Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler! Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke. Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends! Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is. What? Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned! Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that! You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything! Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the- Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will! Really? Okay. Mmmm! It’s good! It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross. I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it. Ross? Let’s go. Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance. Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college! And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did! Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year! Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!! Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom. Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love. Oh, here. Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way. Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve? Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember! We are there! What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium! We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve! Oh my God! Okay, here comes another camera. If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day. Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants? Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him. Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants? Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then? What? Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school. Was it really that good? Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced! 5 6 7 8! Yes! I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you? Me too! Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid! Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier? We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’ Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me! What? We could do it! I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. I can’t do it! That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us. No. Well, you tell a lot of jokes! It’s only you. So do you think that these pictures.... Are, are they trying to tell a story? Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that. Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? Me neither. What?! She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel. It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel. That’s a good idea. Do you know what’s a bad idea? That’s right. Did you hear something? It’s coming from the living room. Hey, you guys. Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple. Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny. It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me? That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point! You start working on that list. I know. Where do you wanna go eat? I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there. All right. No, thank you. Joey, what are you doing? Joey, do you work here? Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here? So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are? Hah! Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance. I am not high maintenance! Why do I have to decide? I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend. Okay, Chandler, you go first. Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas? Do you want me to pick you?! Continue. All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision. You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks! Hi, Chandler. There you are. Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance? Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler. Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler! Ahhh! You are on my list. I didn’t even tell him to say that. . All right you’re off my list. Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend. I pick you, Phoebe. Hey! Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick. I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies! I have not been sick in over three years! I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d! I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say. Rach? You bought a boat? Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy! Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me. Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this? Come on. I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe. Chandler! Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed. How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room. Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. I’m fine. Chandler, I think I’m sick. Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? Come on! I really need your help! Fine, I’ll rub it on myself. Yeah? Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on? I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell? Not now, I’m sick! What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people? Okay, if you really wanna have sex. Worked like a charm. Is someone there? Who? Is that your sister? God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?! Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna... Joey we know you steal our food. Oh, are the drapes still closed hon? This is my favorite part. Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time. Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking. Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good! Where were your parents? Poor thing! You’re jealous of Princess Caroline? Oh great! Did you get a movie? Guys, what’s going on? That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that? This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood. Yes, but you are dead inside. Wh-what, why? Yeah you’re right, we can’t, we shouldn’t watch this. Y’know maybe a little bit! Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle? Hey sweetie! Chicken Soup for the Soul? Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff. Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you. Stop it! I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me. And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside. What is wrong with you?!!! What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond! No you robot!! No, I haven’t. Shhhh!!! Oh my God! Are-are you crying? Bye. Oh my God! Why did they get divorced? And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure. He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key. Thanks. Oh no! What’s the matter? Okay. Bye. Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right? No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff! Hey Phoebe! Guess what? Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant! Hey! Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific! You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds! Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other? Rach, he’s a friend of ours. Joey! Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together. No. You realize what you are don’t you? You’re his bitch. Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!! What?! Yes!! Oh my God! Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down. Let’s take a walk. Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey? Yeah! She’s right in there! Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow! You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you! Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar! Okay!! It’s not mayonnaise!! Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics! Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot! Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married? Well, you’re not. Yeah I can! And don’t think I don’t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin? Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you! It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower. Y’know what? You are right?! Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband! Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?! Phoebe! Put that cigarette out! Put it out!! Here you go sweetie. But, I put some honey in it. Well, you used to like playing the guitar. I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you? No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac. People! People say it! Come here! And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands. No-no-no, no! It’s sensual! Okay! Ohhh no! I can’t promise anything. Yeah, me too. Stop it!! That’s not funny!! I’m sorry, okay? It just...tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal. You don’t want to know what tonight was. Well, tonight was...was going to be my first time. All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times! How many? I was just waiting for the perfect guy. No. He’s not a horrible guy. Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin! Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me? I was kidding. No! Oyster? Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know? It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with! Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend. Noo!! Okay!! Umm, do you have any uhh, moves? I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird. What if I turn out the lights? Chandler? That’s the couch. I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again! Hey! Hey, check me out, I’m a slut! Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again. Are you okay? Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, "Can the doctor see me now?" Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you’re okay? Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again. What?! Why would you do that? Really? Chandler! There was just one woman, wasn’t there? Including me? Hey! Oh, yeah. Yes! Why, did you.. you forget to make yours? Okay. Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever! I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents! I’m just so excited to make the presents! Shoot! Sure! Okay, you go first. Okay! Okay. Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?! Oh, I love it! Thank you so much! Okay, you ready to open yours? Okay. Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny? Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about. No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes... that’s uh... they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different. Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents! No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just... You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna... I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there! Oops! Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too? We have got to wash that! Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive? I wanna wake up early and go get it for you! Oop, your cake is ready! Who the hell are you?! The only problem! Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs. I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me. The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me? You are just the sweetest. Uh-huh. Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin’ me?! Okay. I am!! It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime. Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did. You’re on the phone! Come on! Oh well, it’s not so bad. Joey! He’s working! You would look good in that. Isn’t that mine? Yes, they can stay with us. Hey! Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl? You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend. You dated her! All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favour?! Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay? I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s. So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much. Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes! Does that smell bother you? Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it. Okay! Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector. So it’s okay to date a student. Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents. Joey that is so sweet. What?! You’re going out with her again! Joey! You didn’t even know her! Hey! How’s it goin’? Yes it has! I made cookies! But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven. Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies! Okay! What are you doing? What’s the charity? Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention? Oh, I like Elizabeth. Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs. Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice. Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough? Hey! Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy. Yeah! Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser! You’re not supposed to look! All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny. Our guy’s a great dancer! Do you want our guy to be your guy? Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth? Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys. And slept with the professor. Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work! Uh, would you stop it with that already?! Are you funny? Tell us a joke! All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you. In 1981 you were 13! Hey! Hey! We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy. You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him? Eldad, this is Rachel. Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?! No! You can’t do that! Sit down! We’re winning! Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair! That’s right Patrick, bye-bye! What? Oh my God. Yes. Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce. Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it. That's your call. Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos. They'r alright. No really, they're OK. Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne. I'm outa here. Well, what happened? Was it... Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet? We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes. Wh?! What about my allergies?! Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you’re not very good at it! I... Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay... You had no right to go out with him. You sold me out. Yes you did. You absolutely sold me... Did you just flick me? Fine! You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?! I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month. We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be. Ross!! How crazy that we’d run into you! Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens? Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital. And he’s a great brother! Ohh! No, you said the baby creeps you out. You said the baby. Why would the little girl creep you out? What?! Excuse me! How was your first day? Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy. No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass! Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side. Phoebe, stop writing about us! Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm! Phyllis is sitting in a chair. Phyllis sees what I’m doing. Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. We said six! Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass...seven!" Ugh! What time? Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book! Hi! Oh that’s great! I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make! Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right? Oh, I love museums! Soakin’ up all the culture. Where do you want to start? Yeah! This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged. Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down. Phoebe, that stuff is... Hi, honey. What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner! Oh no! Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!! NOOOO!!!!!!!! Phoebe! Have you seen Chandler?! The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?! I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere! Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure! "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?" Well Rachel’s not here! I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out. Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that? Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel... It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t. Really? I know! I know. I’m gonna go tell Joey that that you’re back. I was really worried about you. Still crying? Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex. I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking. Oh, we have some.... Hey! What’s the big deal? Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going? Do you really see this as a long-term thing? Hi guys. Oh, thank you! What’s going on? What are you doing? Are you okay? Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually... I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket? Are you sure you’re okay? Ohh that’s sweet! Oh my God! Oh my God, Richard. Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard! Hey, it’s good to see you! Yeah... Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back. Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down? It’s good to see you And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom. So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor. Ohh. I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of! Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first weighing stuff. If the school finds out you’re fired. She’s leaving for three months. Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?! Okay well I think... that’s your answer. Why do you want to see my hand? Okay. I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes! Hi guys! What are you up too? Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet. Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world! Okay well that’s good to know. Sure, I love this part! Richard! Ohh... Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up? Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that? What uh... What did you... What?! Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here! Oh God... Why don’t they put chairs back here?! What the... Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?! What were you doing in Africa? Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen. Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait! Yeah! Why? Because of the government. So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you? Yeah, but that’s pigs not people! Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married? Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?! Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh! Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror? Yeah, it’s great. I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship! It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time! No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed. I didn’t change! What?! Is that some kind of boat talk? What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing? Well there’s some people who do want to marry me. Yeah! Richard! That’s right. You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be! Hi. I don’t know why I’m here. I don’t know. Chandler is such an idiot! Yeah, I’ll have a scotch. Still smoking cigars? No that’s, that’s okay. Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago. Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor. Edward Nevski? No. But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you. I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak! Oh! Him. I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?! Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that! Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing. I don’t kn...Umm. I don’t know. Umm... Y’know, I-I... I have to figure..some st...Y’know, some stuff before I can... You wanted it to be a surprise. Chandler.... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There’s a reason why girls don’t do this! Yes. I knew you were likely to take a wife! Come in! Come in! We’re engaged!!! Oh...
