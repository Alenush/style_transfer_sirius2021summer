I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m engaged!!!! I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I’m engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20! Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my...our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me..us...Damnit! Awww, come on...wait...stop it. Okay, to Monica. Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza. Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go! Y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You’re not getting dressed. Yeah, but I don’t think we have time. Let’s do it! Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you- you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it! Phoebe! Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! Come on! Why aren’t you dressed yet?! No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding. Fair enough, now go get ready! I’ll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my... I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past. Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight? See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that. No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together! See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder! That’s true. Thunder being stolen!! Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we? Yes that would be lovely. Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza. No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! Especially with you. I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just...it’s so typical. Paris? Keep talking. I love you! Bonjour, monsieur. Hi Pheebs, what’s up? What?! Yes. Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder. My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie. It’s all everybody at the party could talk about! We had a characturist! And yet, here we are doing it again. Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?! I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night! Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?! I don’t know! I don’t...maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you! I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!! It’s Monica, open up! I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant! I know why! Okay! Why?! What do you mean? I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. Oww! I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying? Okay! Okay! This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage. All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music. All right umm, a string quartet for the procession. A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding. Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too! Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces? Yeah! Roses or Lilies? Oh my God! It’s like one mind. Oh dad, really you don’t need to... Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party. Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What? What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you? I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house! You bought the beach house when I was 23! What about when I started dating Chandler? I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?! I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it? My parents spent the money for our wedding! No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies! How? I don’t have any money. How much? Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?! It’s enough for wedding scenario eight. How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding! This is the most special day of our lives. Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once. You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down? Hey. Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that. Eh, you work for that. You do?! Oh, you’re so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? You thought about that? How many kids were we gonna have? What else did you think about? Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding. No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage. Uh-hmm. I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right. Oh good. Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy. Yeah! Of course! If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy. Oh, I already have one. Hey, I know I what I want! No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe. Uh-huh, yeah. I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children. Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies. Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh? What? Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play. This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week. Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win. He hates to lose. What’s wrong Phoebe? No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!! This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts! No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time. Yeah! I bet I can do it. All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. You don’t? Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman. Hey! How was sailing? Hey! How was it? Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it! You gave my father a lap dance! Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years! I wasn’t escaping. I was trying to help out a squirrel. Come on. Hello? I’m sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg. Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade. No, just a Friday night. The ones we had right after you almost threw up. Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right. Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe? What was her name? Nestle Tollhouse?! Phoebe, is this the recipe? I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time! Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it’s your mom. Wh-what are we gonna tell him? And I have costumes. Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you? Still get a discount on wedding dresses? I’m so happy for you! What?! Oooh! Hey sweetie. I can’t tell you. It’s a secret. Awww. But still no. Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland? If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said. Okay. Oh my God. He threw up? Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired. That’s right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me. Hey! Good, you’re home! Hey baby. I made you a surprise. Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them. Ross! No! No. They’re umm... They’re just uh...ground beef smileys. Excuse me Mr. Mexico. I’m not laughing. You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! What happened in Atlantic City?! You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God. Oh my God! I-I already told him everything! You shush!! Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls! It’s hard for some people! Chandler one time wore my underwear to work! Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross! Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue. No! I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers? Yeah? Ohh, absolutely. Yeah, definitely! Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe. What’s the matter? Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us. That’s not true, there are great pictures of us! Oh, here’s a great one. I know, but look at me all tan. That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y’know... Chandler what do you say? Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile. Yeah! All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy. Or not. I know. Let’s try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron! That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it! They can’t all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is. Do you really want to pull at that thread? Hey! There you are! Are you okay? What?! Chandler, what were you thinking? Chandler? Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper! Okay. Yeah, we really do! Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like! Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor. First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me... Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine.... If Phoebe were my maid of honor.... Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset. Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide! Because then I don’t have to! I’m really not deciding! Yeah that’s right. Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck. No, it’s more like a good luck. She was like 30, dark hair, attractive. Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college? What are you doing? Oh my God yes! Who is she? Did you break up with her? Why? Fat?! You broke up with a girl because she was fat?! Well, apparently she does. Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are! You’re Lewis Posin. Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why? No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie. No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me. It’s pretty clear. Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize. All right, I...I have to ask. Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again? Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained? In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point. Well... That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat. How? What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are! Keep going. Even if I shrink down to two inches tall? I love you. Hey, what’s going on? Ohh, wow! That’s great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! She sent the chicken back again?! Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in! Lucky bastard! Janice. I’m fine. Oh...Uh... Well, she saw the ring. Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people. Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too. Huh? Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?! Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad. Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?! Really? So-so you would’ve just lied? Would it really have been that easy? Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark. He might still show up. Is that all? It’s actually going to be just family. What are we gonna do? Janice, what umm, what are you doing here? Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they? Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom. We’ll just...we’ll just let her stay. Kinda like your Barca lounger. I never stop thinking about it. Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go! Because Chandler still has feelings for you! That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding. I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can. It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose. Nobody cares about the Dakotas. 'Cause you invited your assistant. Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do. All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work? Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? Chandler? Can you give me a hand? Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often? That's my pie! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand. I'll be right there! Phoebe! Phoebe, open up! Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? Don't do what? 1250. Yeah. Really? I'd say 3 to 4. When it's your assistant, I would say never. Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend. Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now. Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong. Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her! That's not gonna work. Hey! I didn't know either. Yeah, I knew. Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream! Hi, honey. What? Why, why would... That's right, she came back all by herself. Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent. Did the girl ever let you ride it? Making holiday candy for the neighbors. I’m gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece. See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors. Where you can make out with your assistant. Oh yeah, what’s the plan? Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?! Did you two... Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire... Okay. The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy! Joey!! Did you eat all the neighbor candy?! They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!! Who is that?! Hi. Do you know what time it is? Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven. Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning. Um-hmm. Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried. Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute. Umm, can we see you ride it? See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing! I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? Rules are rules. No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em? Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever. All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody! It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work! Hmm? But they like it! Maybe. Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!! No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system! Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool! Thank you. Did you smoke? I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door. Betrothed... Licorice? Are you gonna dress up as Santa? No. About a half an hour. No. Bing's weird. Hey! Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you! Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you. Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does. I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing. You need to give him money. No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off. You've got to be smooth about it. How did it go? It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money! I don't know. We'd be eating our soup right now. Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table! It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying. Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore? What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo? Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas. Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert? Come on Ben. Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say. Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? Yes, is that okay? No. Ross, when’s this comet thing start? Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly. She’s sleeping. Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up. It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin. With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep. Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway. Okay that does sound like fun. The second sister dies?! The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest? Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. Are you still awake? You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we’re both up... What?! What are you doing?! Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep. Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world! What?! Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella! Give me the good stuff. Okay, I’m up! I’m up! That really was some of your best work. I have to be up in seven minutes. Really?! Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish! Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section... Look at this. I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house! Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down. Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym! As much as they love you? Hey! That was me and Ross. Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone. Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories... I used to love to play restaurant. Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! Hey guys! Hey! Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days. Okay. So, which boxes are mine? Okay. Oh! A coloring book! Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines. Oh, an old glove? Wow! Look at this! I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt! Oh, this is yours. This isn’t mine. Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes? What? Just mine? So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head! So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!! I can’t believe this! Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don’t even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft. What do you think this is? How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face! What’s this? What?! Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?! All right! Hey guys! Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger? Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever! Happy birthday!!! It’s your birthday! Chocolate-chip pancakes! They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago. Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends… Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross. I can’t believe you bought this. All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well. Weren’t you asked to leave sonny? Heyyy!! You got the door open!! Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later! Noo!!! Noo!! Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of. Really?! You promise? Okay. I love you so much. What about your breath?! Okay. I can do that. Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in. Yay! Paul! Phil! Awwwww… All you had to do was buy the card! Really! That long?! Look all you want, it’s happening! You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends… I really like to say that I’m-um… Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!! That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake? Oh man! He’s gonna eat the cake! I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony. Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony. Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading. Do you mind telling us what it is? What is DOOL? Who are they killing off? She’s my favorite character on DOOL. And the way she slaps all the time! Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! What is that? It sounds like it’s coming from across the street. What? Nooo!! No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?! He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song! Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are. No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet. You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favour? Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you’re a stupid bitch. Nice to meet you! My God you’re great! What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him. Come on! It wasn’t that bad! All right, what about the third guy? Can you blame him? Well then we still have a problem. Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies. Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married. Are you serious? We’re never gonna find anybody. Joey look it’s really sweet… That is true. It might be kinda cool. Hey Pheebs, how’s it going? Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something? Here, take a couple of these. It’s Hexadrin. Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down——gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet. Hexadrin. No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff. Y’know, the possible side effects. Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons! In case it happens. You did it! You got ordained?! Phoebe, your liver is right here. Yeah! Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby! How about receiving? It doesn’t say that! There you go! No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought that I was Ross’s mom. And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much… Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh? Is Joey here? Wouldn’t you be? Really? Well, not anymore. I know, I just thought it would be fun. Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. Okay! Y’know what’s weird? This doesn’t feel weird! You’re a really good kisser. Hm-hmm! Wow! You are really fast! We’re gonna see each other naked. Do you wanna do it at the same time? One! Two! Eh, we weren’t that close anyway! Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me. What?! Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey. No, because it-it didn’t seem important. Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with! Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?! Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal! Hey-hey. Yeah baby! Honey! Dinner’s ready! Your favorite! Yep! And lot’s of it! Okay, in we go. So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six. Chandler. I will. No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job. There were only twelve. What are peanut butter fingers?! This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it! Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby. Have you found your dress yet? No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just here to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale. Yeah! So-so when are you getting married? Oh May 15th. Yeah! Jeffery. The best man? Wow! Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings. All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts. When you hear it, come running. All right. Hey! Don’t be a baby! No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don’t crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! I’m sorry, this one’s taken! Whoa! Megan! You came?! This is my dress! Yes it is! You saw me wearing it! What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me! Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! Go! Go! Go! NOW!!!!!!!! Oh… Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh— That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress! What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do? How? Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work. Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go. Oh crap! Don’t come in here! No! We only mess around at his place! No, I’m wearing a wedding dress. Yeah but I’m not keeping it. Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it. Really? Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings. Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little. Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys? Alright, what’s going on? I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. Joey! Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy! Oh Soap Opera Digest award! Honey? Is that something you’re making up? Okay, I’ll go! Really? My God, he’s really cute. Phoebe, I’m engaged! Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged. Well you should be embarrassed. Hey! How’d your date go with Jake? Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly. And did he? Okay-okay, I got it. I got it. Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I? No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again. Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling… See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is, don’t you think? Have you seen Chandler? ‘Cause I just keep thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have, and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it. Phoebe! Come on, I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this. Why? You gotta help me out here Pheebs. So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with? Your mother told you this? The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13? Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share? You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all? Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again? Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush? Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else? Even with me? Really? Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid… What was it for? Wow! Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding. Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand? I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us for a few days. Uh-hmm. Ross, she’s 25 years old. Hey! Subtle guys! I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower. Okay. Sorry. Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie? That’s what you say about porn. No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on! Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. Hey! Oh boy, me too! Yeah? The wedding is off, sloppy and immature! Okay. But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch. Shrill?! The wedding is back on! So, are you ready to go? Chandler! Cassie needs to stay at your place. Because Purvy Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her. You were staring about eight inches south of there. She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn. Wafer thin ice! So to get this part you can’t be? But you are? But you told them you weren’t? Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with? What were you thinking? Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck! Oh my God, what are you gonna do?! Unless! Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion. Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat. Hey! Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge? Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work. Cheese? That won’t work. Olive loaf? I hope that won’t work. No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys. I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on. Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna. Oh, just until the glue dries. Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink. I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me. Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work. Toothpick? What are you trying on now? And? Joey! What?! Which one?! Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh. For what? You al-you already had it? Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best. Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don’t even like! Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you… Wow! They were lovers. Okay, so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people’s names on them. And Rach, here you are. Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours. Chandler, relax it’s not a contest. Certainly not a close one. Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they? Oh! Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm you’re parents will be at home in Queens. Why would they think they’re invited? Joey! Ross’s parents are my parents! Oh please, you just want more blue pins. All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar! Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go! What?! Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad. Oh Joey! No she hasn’t. Well, what am I going to say? Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What, are they Irish?! Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time. What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets! 007 has a fancy car! 007 gets all the ladies. How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini. How about a Youhoo with a funny straw? Hey. The show?! Have you ever been to one of my weddings? The wedding starts at six. You’ll vamp?! You just carry that around? Between you and… A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants. All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the altar and scream racial slurs? I don’t care! Oh. Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!! There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet? Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding. No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say. Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! Thank you. Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. Ennnh. Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?! Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven! It’s kind of an important one! All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…! No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two? Oh yeah? When? Why won't I be married when I'm 40? Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me? Well? Do you think he knew I was here? Wait, wait, wait! Look! I bet this will work! What? You said you loved me! I can't believe this! Yes, you did! You love me! Then all your stuff would be here. Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense. You wanted it to be a surprise. Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this! Yes. Come in! Come in! We’re engaged!!! Chicken? I could eat some chicken. Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows! Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell. I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big… Bye! Actually, I did! Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! Them?! Who's them? Joey! Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So… She's bluffing! You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks! Of course. I love you too, Chandler. Well actually, Ross doesn't. Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? Hey, you guys! Oh that’s so sweet. Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine. Chandler!!
