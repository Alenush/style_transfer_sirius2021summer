Hi. Ooh, Phoebe, you look great! Ooh, are you gonna do magic? Hang on a second I just got in. Has somebody been drinking my fat? Rach, did you check the machine? Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?! What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back? Huh? If it is a new message, what is he calling to say? So, should I call him back? I called him. Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy? Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough. I know the code to his answering machine. "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy." He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone. Well, who's voice was that? Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle? It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle. Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to. Okay. That was her right? See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now. Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that.... Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back. Okay, fine. Not any more! Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye. Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!! "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!! I don't know! Noooo!!!! Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number. Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning. Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale. I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. Hey guys. Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin. Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch. I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies. I'm talking about me having a baby. Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan. It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff. Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis. You're gonna what? What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something.... Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know? Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!' Joey, this is you! Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here. I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him. Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine. Hey. To the bank. Sperm. Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes... What? Really? Why? Hoyt? Really, is he a swimmer? I like that. What? We do not have one of those signs. Two girls and a boy? And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them. Yeah. Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back. See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere. Oh, now you want a pad. I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob? There it is. Joey, what are you doing? What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away? Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you. That is never good. Welcome to our side of the tunnel. You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat. Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control. She has to know that your not ready. My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'. You know what, everything's gonna be okay. If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call. Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy. Aw, it's soo unfair. What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman. Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time. The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag. How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. Wasn't there a little song? 'I am Bea.' 'I drink tea.' '....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... ' A-ha!!! No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox. So, Chandler, who's on your list? First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list. Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982? Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor? I highly doubt that. I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? That's a little more than I wanted to see. I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor. You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon! What kind of karate is that? So how's it going with you guys? Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head. Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game. Oh, how do you play the shadow game? I just asked you. No, that is what the game is. What's the matter? He's retiling my floor. Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it. It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for? And who laminated it? Are you serious? Oh my God. Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it? Rach, are you really gonna let him do this? Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone. Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more! What? Hi. Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks. Chris says they’re closing down the bar. Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place. Got me. Hey, did you pick a roommate? Is it the Italian guy? He’s so cute. Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt. Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi! Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it. Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations Aww, not right now. I know. So, I’ll get-get back to my friend. Oh, that’d be great. Thanks. Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life. What are you doing with the lamp? Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week. Hi, again. Thank you soo, much. You want some help with that? Whoa! Are you okay? It’s the heat. And-and the humidity. Do you wanna come in for some lemonade? Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable. This place is really my Grandmother’s. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty? Okay, here’s your penis! Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!! So?! Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up! I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex? It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it. Pheebs? Where’s your bed? What? What are you talking about? Everybody knows! Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over. What?!?! You can spill. In the sink. I love you, too. What? I’m just said. Hey. Help yourself. Phoebe moved out. I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend? Well, I think so. I know, it is isn’t it? Yeah! And I got it on sale, too. Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can. I know. Thanks. Hey, are you okay? Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct? I was always Joanne. I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way. What's the part? Not at these prices. Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy. What's this? This is not the bed I ordered! Phoebe! Why is this car in my bedroom? When did I sign for it? Did you make brownies today? Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed. Sometimes I have bad dreams. Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this? Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed. You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband. So, do you want me to watch Ben for you? Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!! Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave. He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him. No we're not. Okay. Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in! Okay, we're gonna need a distraction. I got it! The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!! A hat! Yes! We need a hat. Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat? Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius! Give it. Give it. It just makes more sense as an ensemble. Besides, it takes the focus off the hat. Sure, we have no money, go ahead. Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that? Did he just say 'Monica bang'? Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out! Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun? You okay? Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident. Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded. All right, we should call somebody. How are we gonna do that? There's no way. Yeah. No. Why? Really?! Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! And yet, we're still poking him. Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles. Every year. Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.' Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose. To score the winning touchdown, by the way. I won the game. Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years. Once!! Okay. Let's bring it in. Well, why don't we just bunny up. Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey. Phoebe. All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again. Huddle up. Okay. Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right? Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block. Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing? Break. Score!! 7 to nothing! Losers walk! Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down. No it's not, it's second. Wow, what? Pulling what? It's second down. I heard that! All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! Run, Phoebe, run! After the snap! Does so count! Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have. Dead leg!! No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime. Y'know what? I'll think you'll play. Because the winner gets this! When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out. No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it! Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game. All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus? All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest. Break! Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya? What?! I just touched him and he went over. Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done! You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you. Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game. Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls. Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change. All right then. Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries. We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out... Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um! All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long. Honey, there's a reason. All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break. Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike! No! I'm not okay! Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up! All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long. Break! Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!! Ow!! Let go! No! I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough. Let go! You broke a little girl's leg?!! Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk... All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all? No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this. Oh God! I gotta go! Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures? What? No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes! Oh God! Christmas cookie? Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree. Is this the one that I threw out last year? Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas? Oh. Um-mm. Wow. Joey, how do you do it? He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything. I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him. All right, be my guest. Honey, what's the matter? It's Joey's birthday. Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there. I know honey, I'm sorry. Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy! Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs? I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him. Joey, where are the Jello shots? Stick out your tongue. Oh my!! How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters. Hi. Isn't that great? Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.' How ya feelin'? What is the worse part? Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead. I mean, was it Gina? No, no, no, that's Dina. That was me. That's okay. Y'know which one was she again? No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet. I guess they're back from their date. Oh my God! I am good. I finished my book. I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk? Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen. Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number. Yay! Oh, that is amazing! What? Are you crazy?! What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too? I mean don't you trust her? Then get over yourself! Grow up! So ah, Phoebe, how was your date? Yeah, I do know. Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. Please, I'm not going for anything. Would you please go? Look Julio, someone left their book here. Oh yeah, what are you reading? Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it? Your a poet and don't know it. Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about? Mine? Right here? How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it. Hi! It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem. Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs? All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too. Hey. Oh-ho, look what I got Julio. Yeah, just like the one in the poem. What do you mean? So! I'm just an empty vase, huh? Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me. You don't even know me... What? I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe... Oh yeah. Hi. Six? I just had it for one night. It's three. Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three. Oh my God. Richard? Hi! Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks. Right. What? That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity. It's good to see you too. You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn. Yeah. Me too. Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea. No, I just I think that it's too soon. Morning. Yeah well, I ran into Richard. Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger. Tomorrow night. It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has. We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends. You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes. You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird. Oops. Gotta keep squishing. Okay. Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt. Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be..... Umm, you've got some on your pants. So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word! Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure. I'll call you back. So we can be friends who sleep together. Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies? Oh. No! No! 'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends. Hi. You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire. What are you smiling at? Yeah, right. I love this friend thing! Ow! Oh my God! Oh my God! So um, who was she? Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this. Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people? Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever. That's not true, you don't have a moustache. Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again. How 'bout one last game of racquetball? Watch the thorns! Look at you. All jealous. Yeah, sure. Y'know those are a delicacy in India. Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh? Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge. No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house. Yeah, Ginger something. No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.' Well, what did you do? Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way. You gave her food poisoning!? Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire? Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps. Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to. Well, don't 'cha wanna? Okay, well I do know you. Well so? Hi! Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad. So umm, how was your date with Ginger? Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package. Uh-huh. Sorry, Pheebs. We'd love too. Wow! It's like Rachel in High School. Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke! I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95. Why? Do you have a report due? Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN. Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from? Where's that? I don't have an atlas. Oh, but wait I do have a globe. Hold on. 'Kay, here you go. It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener. Oh, no thanks. Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there? Wow! It's small. So you had fun, huh? No. Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her. All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel. Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy. Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry? Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez vous couchet avec moi, saiz soi. Why? What did I say? Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice. I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant. Well, I was having a conversation. What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation? Oh. Can I have a tissue? Hey, the man's dog just died. It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons. Hey. How’s the big anniversary dinner? Ohhh, nice. What?! That’s okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?! Oh no!! Rachel, you and Mark?! Hey. Oh, there’s banana on it. So then you know? Oh, good. Thanks. Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing.... Yes! Have you seen it? I know!! Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest! Did that! Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh! No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax. That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest. Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips? Ow! Ow!! Ow!! It’s okay, it’s okay. We were just waxing our legs. That’s right. What? Rachel said everything was okay. Oh my God. Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?! What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there. Because they’ll know we’ve been listening. What if they don’t? Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am. Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game? No! Rachel is meeting us here. It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship. Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!! Let’s get the show on it! Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close. We’re sorry honey. Very bad. Chandler!! Weren’t you nine?! We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first. Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother. No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge! Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us? No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas. What? Ow! No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms. So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person? What?! Please!! These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel. All right then, your bra would still be big. Chandler!! Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg? Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up. So the going for help went well? Then why are you smoking? Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. What’s ‘pleh’? Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards? I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her? Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing? Here we go again. I don’t know. What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you! All right, we’ll call you when we get back. What’s so funny? Oh. Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married? So, um, how-how did you guys meet? And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. Pete, can I get you something else? Haven’t you and I covered that topic? Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food. I mean really, think about it. Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me. Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids. All right, I get your point. Hey. Uh, yeah. Here you go. As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him. That’s Bill Clinton. Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete? I’m not gonna go out with him. Or incredibly offensive. What the hell is this? Seriously, what is this supposed to mean? You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you? What?! Okay, umm, you’re a loon. I don’t know. ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour. Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay? I know!! Hey! And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. Bye. So, where do you want to go? Oh, that’s sounds great. Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire? Why, how much is that? Oh, this is so great. All right then. Bye. Hello, people who do not live here. I gave you a key for emergencies! He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!! Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything. Two. Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?! Sure. Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo. Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship. So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean? I so wanna be attracted to you. I’m sorry. It’s not? Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too. Hey, Rach, how was work? By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff. Something wrong? Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh? Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? I get the dollhouse! Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse. Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with. Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!! I know!!! Okay. What’s this? Not one that can pee on the roof. I don’t want a ghost. Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go. It’s very interesting, Phoebe. Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?! You’re kidding?! That’s great! Oh my. Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you? Hmm, bite me. I’m in the shower! Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager. I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire. Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate. Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box. That was you?! Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip? Oh, what’d ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee? Regular or decaf? Okay. So what did you do today Pete? What?! Oh. Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant? I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me. Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade. Oh, please. What? Honey. Oh God, I’m so sorry. Oh God! Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I’m kidding! What-what was it you were gonna tell us? Okay. Here’s the thing. I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me.... Huh? Oh? Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you! Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit! Okay. Can you give me a little push? I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! I’m okay!! I’m all right!! Hey! Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight. I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete. I know. What? Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me. Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel? Does it have to do with Joey? Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed? Does it involve travel? Does it involve clogs? Clogs. Claws?! Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete? What is it?! What about Pete? Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me! Okay, I gotta go. Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company? I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners. Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. Did you just smell my hair? Oh God. You still have feelings for me don’t you? Pete. No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice. You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job. And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry. Okay, bye. All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow! I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now! Really? Who’s number two? Bye-bye! Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody. Here you go. You can wear this. Uh-huh. Phoebe? All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay? And! We also have speaker phone. Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late. Of course not. There’s our star! Hi! Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version. Hey! Yeah. Where were you? You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy. Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy. Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night? Anyway, how did it go with Kate? Joey, you had the night! When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person! Did you like learn about her family? Yes!! Oh! One. We’re kidding! Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late. Phoebe, it’s been two days. What? Oh. Pete's breaking up with me. I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk. Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad. Really?! I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants. Yeah. Which one do you like more? Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command. No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything. I know. Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! I guess that's how. Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants. Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news. Oh no-no-no, it's still me. Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon. I love you. Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news. Oh my. And that's Pete's Mom. Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose. Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy. Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it. Brides magazines? It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy. I know. I need more pie. So then, are you going to dump Jason? Ooh, nice. Oh, right! I completely forgot about that. Yeah? Wow. What’s that? Okay. You wanna what?! What are you talking about? And I suppose you used a ring designer for that. My parents will be so happy. Hey. You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over... So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm... I... Forget it. I have no idea. He didn’t ask me to marry him. He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy. I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling. Yeah, but without the costumes. So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff? What’s fish hooking? I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy. Okay, can we please go eat? Anything but stew. Hi! Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you. Promise me you’ll be careful. Hey, are we still on for tonight? Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own... How ‘bout just a boom? God Ross, what is that? I love you, Pete!!! Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge! Hey! It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you. I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets. Well, you’re not gonna get going are you? Well, no. But... That guy stood on your neck until you passed out! You didn’t know that already? Okay, just get a lot better. Fast. Yeah. That-that was the problem. Hey. Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. Four, please. I’m really nervous. Thank you. Please tell me you’re stopping now. You are insane! You-you gotta give this up! Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!! Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me. Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. Yes? Really?! Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in. Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid. Thanks! Yeah right. You made a joke right? So I laughed. Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice. Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food! Seriously, where did you get the hat? What's with all this sand? What?! What are you crazy?! Aww, thank you. So what's Phoebe like? Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see. Oh well, where is he?! Totally familiar. Well, why would she lie to you? Strip Happy Days Game? I think I'll help her out. What is going on here? You painting his toenails? Chasing him all around the room? He's totally flirting with you too. Huh? You didn't even take off your pants. What? Like a log. That's that weird voice again.
