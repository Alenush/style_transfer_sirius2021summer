НЕДРУГ: Andrew Reich amp Ted Cohen Transcribed by: Coffee Mug.
МОНИКА: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on. You wanna?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
МОНИКА: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're on!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: What's up?
ФИБИ: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want.
РОСС:, finally.
ФИБИ: Is that Ross?
МОНИКА: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
ФИБИ: Sounds like he's with someone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh. Dr. Geller!
РОСС: God, you're amazing. I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, that's Charlie!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
ФИБИ: Oh that tart, floozy, giant.
МОНИКА: I'm not sure about this.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
МОНИКА: No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I'm her!
ФИБИ: Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Get over here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ooh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
МОНИКА: Thank you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
МОНИКА: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
МОНИКА: I'm on it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Anything?
МОНИКА: I think I hear curtains closing.
ФИБИ: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
МОНИКА: Bedsprings, unmistakable!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do realise that's your brother?
МОНИКА: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute. Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
МОНИКА: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay Buckwheat!
ФИБИ: You gotta hear this, it's great. It's like free porn!
РОСС: Weh. sigh.
НЕДРУГ: uhm. Is everything okay?
РОСС: Yeah, It's just. I don't think I can do this.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh. Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the. I could just.
РОСС: No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
НЕДРУГ: I uhm. I completely understand.
РОСС: Alright, I'm gonna go find them. I just need a, need a before I can, you know. Grandma, grandma, grandma. Okay, I see you later.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ФИБИ: That's the door. He's gone.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And she's, turning on the TV, and watching. Miss Congeniality!
МОНИКА: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
РОСС: Hey, what are you guys doing?
ФИБИ: Oh, we're just, we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you. Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa.
МОНИКА: Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye!
РОСС: Okay, uhm. Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it.
РОСС: Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You got it!
РОСС: Thanks! Thank you!
МОНИКА: Other wall, people! Other wall!
РОСС: Rach, you there?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
ДЖОУИ: No idea what it means.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, okay, just hide!
РОСС: Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: There's no room under the bed.
РОСС: Is everything okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
РОСС: You know where Joey is?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I really don't.
РОСС: Can I talk to you for a minute?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, sure.
ДЖОУИ: I don't believe this. Have you guys been.
ФИБИ: Shhh. This is the listening side of the wall.
РОСС: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh, right, yeah.
РОСС: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know. I know it's been really hard for you.
РОСС: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and, oh, before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
РОСС: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You would think!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey!
ДЖОУИ: Is he gone?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How are you doing this?
ДЖОУИ: Pssst.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How, wha. Hey! What are you. What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
НЕДРУГ: YEAH!
ФИБИ: Now, what is this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
ФИБИ: Oh no. Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
ДЖОУИ: Well, he's with Charlie now.
МОНИКА: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
ДЖОУИ: You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, look you guys. Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Enunciate!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Get out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are they right?
ДЖОУИ: Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should, hold off until we talk to Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I think that'd be best. So, so I'm gonna. I'm gonna take off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Although.
ДЖОУИ: I like although!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, you know. Ross and I haven't dated in like, six years.
ДЖОУИ: Six years? Wow. It's almost as long as highschool.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
ДЖОУИ: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No.
ДЖОУИ: I'm thinking about you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Let's forget about Ross.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Forgotten.
ДЖОУИ: What's wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing.
НЕДРУГ: Seriously. What is it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing. It's really. It's nothing. Come here, come here.
НЕДРУГ: What's wrong?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sorry, I just uhm. I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.
ДЖОУИ: Well, maybe I can help.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, your lips are so soft. Do that again.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, we really need to talk to Ross.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
РОСС: You guys ready to go?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
РОСС: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
РОСС: Learn about Jesus.
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: So, did you talk to Joey?
РОСС: Uh, no, no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, sounds like a good idea. Dr. Geller!
РОСС: Stop it!
НЕДРУГ: PHD.
РОСС: You're filthy!
ФИБИ: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
РОСС: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright.
МОНИКА: Check it out!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!, aaahhhh!
МОНИКА: What do you think?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think. I think I can see your scalp.
МОНИКА: Don't you just love it?
РОСС: Ye. Yeah. Yeah. You got shellfish in your head.
НЕДРУГ: It's so, something. You go girlfriend!
РОСС: You've never said that in your life, have you?
НЕДРУГ: Not once.
РОСС: I thought so.
МОНИКА: And listen to this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What d'ya know. It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
ДЖОУИ: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm, kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
ДЖОУИ: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
РОСС: Oh, I uh, I mean, I, dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
ДЖОУИ: I understand.
РОСС: No, I'll do it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
ФИБИ: Uhm. You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign, you feel free to roam about my cabin.
НЕДРУГ: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during.
ФИБИ: Aaah, you're not good at this.
НЕДРУГ: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
ФИБИ: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
НЕДРУГ: Oh.
ФИБИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: Uhm. I can't do anything tonight.
ФИБИ: Why not?
НЕДРУГ: I have a date.
ФИБИ: You have a. You have a date? With who?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's, my girlfriend.
ФИБИ: You have, have a girlfriend?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. Well, when, you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
ФИБИ: For how long?
НЕДРУГ: Three months.
ФИБИ: Three months? Okay. This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
НЕДРУГ: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
ФИБИ: Oh, okay, good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
НЕДРУГ: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material.
ФИБИ: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
РОСС: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Good luck.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
ДЖОУИ: I guess so. I'm just, really nervous.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Still nervous?
ДЖОУИ: I'm gonna get the lasagna.
РОСС: Hey Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
РОСС: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
РОСС: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РОСС: So, I uhm, kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
РОСС: Okay, last night after you guys broke up, so sorry to hear about that, by the way. Well, Charlie and I were talking, and, well.
ДЖОУИ: You kissed.
РОСС: Wha. What? What would give you that idea?
ДЖОУИ: I saw you.
РОСС: Yeah, we kissed, but, nothing else, nothing else happened, okay.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
РОСС: What?
ДЖОУИ: It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And. I want you to be happy.
РОСС: Are you serious?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Now I have something.
РОСС: I am speachless. I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, look, before you.
РОСС: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous.
ДЖОУИ: I am those things, yeah.
РОСС: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now. I may have to rethink some stuff.
ДЖОУИ: Dude!
РОСС: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you.
ДЖОУИ: I can't think of anything.
РОСС: Thanks!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So hi!
РОСС: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So you eh, you talked to Joey?
РОСС: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! That's great!
РОСС: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, so everything's okay?
РОСС: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is. He is an amazing guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah. Well, obviously I think so too.
РОСС: Well, I'm so excited about this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Excited?
РОСС: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
ДЖОУИ: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
ФИБИ: Hi, Mike's place.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, it's Mike.
ФИБИ: Ooh, that was fast.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, err, no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair. Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F. Y. I.
НЕДРУГ: One more thing. There, might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
ФИБИ: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
ФИБИ: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
ФИБИ: I. I'm Phoebe.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
ФИБИ: Enchanté.
МОНИКА: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these. Ow!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
МОНИКА: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out, say, at the break of dawn?
МОНИКА: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you singing?
МОНИКА: It's Bolero from 10.
МОНИКА: You what? You said you liked them.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
МОНИКА: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Again, let's journey back. As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey. Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
МОНИКА: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this. OUCH!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hit yourself in the tooth?
МОНИКА: And the eye!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
РОСС: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aaah. Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
РОСС: Okay, shoot!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, uhm, alright, here's the deal.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What is it?
РОСС: Oh, major shampoo explosion!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
РОСС: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, yeah. Okay, look it's about me and.
РОСС: Oh, not another one! Oh my G. And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
ФИБИ: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know. Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is. I'm gonna take off.
НЕДРУГ: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
ФИБИ: Alright. Susie, can I call you Susie?
НЕДРУГ: My name is Precious.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm. Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you. Mike and I are back together, and uhm, unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
НЕДРУГ: I just can't believe this. Why?
ФИБИ: Well, I don't.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
ФИБИ: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
НЕДРУГ: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
ФИБИ: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
НЕДРУГ: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
ФИБИ: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me.
НЕДРУГ: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
ФИБИ: Look, Precious. Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you. He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
НЕДРУГ: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
ФИБИ: You're welcome!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, you've been in there for a long time. Is everything okay?
МОНИКА: Not really.
МОНИКА: I have a problem.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? What happened?
МОНИКА: Well, I was dancing around, and singing No Woman, No Cry and I got stuck.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can't move at all?
МОНИКА: Oh, well, I can move.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
МОНИКА: I guess so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Some of these look a little frayed.
МОНИКА: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: So, did you err, did you tell Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go. I didn't mean it. I'm so so-ooory.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, alright, okay, uhm. How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow, tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't.
ДЖОУИ: I know, I know, but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Good night!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Goo-ood night!
ДЖОУИ: Good night!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Seriously, good night!
ДЖОУИ: Stop saying good night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Look what I found in the drawer. And you said I'd never wear this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
МОНИКА: Sure, what do you have in mind?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think you know.
МОНИКА: Really? I don't really feel like it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is what I want to do.
МОНИКА: Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
