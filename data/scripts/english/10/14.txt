НЕДРУГ: Thank you guys for having us over.
ФИБИ: Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
МОНИКА: Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
РОСС: Hey, you guys... I have great news.
МОНИКА: Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
РОСС: Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A dinosaur died a million years ago?
РОСС: Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
ФИБИ: Wow!
РОСС: Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh, Italian!
МОНИКА: No one wanted seconds, right?
РОСС: No, no. I-I'm good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
РОСС: I'm up for tenure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Congratulations!
РОСС: You too! What are the odds?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh!
ДЖОУИ: Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
МОНИКА: I don't know who I'm happiest for...
ФИБИ: I do, he's been working on that all day!
ФИБИ: Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
МОНИКА: No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
ФИБИ: Where did you go to do it?
МОНИКА: Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: YOU NEVER DID IT!
МОНИКА: I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
НЕДРУГ: Here you go.
ФИБИ: Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
ФИБИ: All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mrs Hannigan?
ФИБИ: What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
ДЖОУИ: Hey guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
ДЖОУИ: No, thank you.
МОНИКА: All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
ДЖОУИ: But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
МОНИКА: Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
ДЖОУИ: You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Damn it.
МОНИКА: See you guys later.
ФИБИ: Okay!
МОНИКА: I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
ФИБИ: Good for you. That was really mature.
ДЖОУИ: What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
НЕДРУГ: You're a strange kind of grown-up.
ФИБИ: Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
НЕДРУГ: Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
ФИБИ: All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
ДЖОУИ: I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
НЕДРУГ: Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
НЕДРУГ: I know. With Gukki
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sssshhhh!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi... I'm on a date...
НЕДРУГ: That's great!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
НЕДРУГ: Well, you got uhm... good energy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, hi!
НЕДРУГ: James Campbell...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Excuse us.
НЕДРУГ: Please...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
НЕДРУГ: So... your resumé is quite impressive.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
НЕДРУГ: Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
НЕДРУГ: Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? I-I don't.
НЕДРУГ: You don't?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I-I-I love it there.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: That's Hugo Boss?
ФИБИ: This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
НЕДРУГ: How can I help you?
ФИБИ: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
НЕДРУГ: You need to fill out this form.
ФИБИ: Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
НЕДРУГ: It can be anything you want.
ФИБИ: Well, not anything, I mean...
НЕДРУГ: Yeah... anything.
ФИБИ: Oh, this could take a while.
НЕДРУГ: Get out of my line.
ФИБИ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey Pheebs.
ФИБИ: Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
МОНИКА: Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
ФИБИ: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what we were gonna name the baby.
МОНИКА: Phoebe!
ФИБИ: Uh! Princess Consuela.
МОНИКА: You seriously changed your name to that?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh!
МОНИКА: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
ФИБИ: Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, how'd the interview go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! It's not good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is a bad interview.
ФИБИ: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
МОНИКА: Oh God. I'm so sorry.
РОСС: Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
ФИБИ: Ross...
РОСС: I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
НЕДРУГ: Congratulations!
РОСС: This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
НЕДРУГ: Six? You want me to join you?
РОСС: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
РОСС: I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
РОСС: Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
ФИБИ: Can you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
РОСС: And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
ФИБИ: And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
РОСС: But also knowing it means a lot.
МОНИКА: But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
РОСС: ...that center around work.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To Ross!
НЕДРУГ: Ross!
РОСС: You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
ФИБИ: Oh God!
РОСС: No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
РОСС: Rach, I'm so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
РОСС: Great. I feel like an idiot.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's okay, you didn't know.
РОСС: Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
МОНИКА: Thank you for letting us see the house again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
НЕДРУГ: Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
МОНИКА: Ah, so glad you decided to come.
ДЖОУИ: Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
МОНИКА: No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
МОНИКА: Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
ДЖОУИ: Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
МОНИКА: No it's not!
ДЖОУИ: Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
МОНИКА: Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
ДЖОУИ: FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
МОНИКА: Joey, we know that's you.
ДЖОУИ: no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
НЕДРУГ: Hey
ФИБИ: Welcome back!
НЕДРУГ: Ah! I missed you
ФИБИ: Oh, me too!
НЕДРУГ: So, what's new?
ФИБИ: Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
НЕДРУГ: That's great! You changed you name?
ФИБИ: Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding right?
ФИБИ: Nope.
НЕДРУГ: You really did that?
ФИБИ: Yep.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, but you can't do that.
ФИБИ: Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
ФИБИ: Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
НЕДРУГ: Crap Bag.
ФИБИ: Mike Crap Bag?
НЕДРУГ: No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
ФИБИ: You're not serious, right?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
ФИБИ: Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
НЕДРУГ: I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
ФИБИ: And I love Crap.
ДЖОУИ: Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Who are you?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
НЕДРУГ: I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
НЕДРУГ: I hate my parents.
ДЖОУИ: I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
НЕДРУГ: Like what?
ДЖОУИ: Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
НЕДРУГ: What are you? Eight?
ДЖОУИ: Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
НЕДРУГ: I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
ДЖОУИ: Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
НЕДРУГ: I really don't.
ДЖОУИ: What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
НЕДРУГ: My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
НЕДРУГ: This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, I guess.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, maybe.
НЕДРУГ: Then you gotta let them go.
ДЖОУИ: I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
НЕДРУГ: I read a lot.
ДЖОУИ: Just when I thought we could be friends.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, thank you...
НЕДРУГ: You still don't know my name, do you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, now I don't have to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, what is taking you so long?
РОСС: I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mark? Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: How've you been?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
НЕДРУГ: Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
РОСС: Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
НЕДРУГ: Clever. So how are you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
НЕДРУГ: Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
НЕДРУГ: Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great! I'll call ya!
НЕДРУГ: Nice to see you.
РОСС: Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
РОСС: See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
РОСС: That is Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes.
РОСС: I hate that guy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? You don't want me to get a job?
РОСС: Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh.
РОСС: I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
МОНИКА: Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Man, those two dogs are going at it!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey, where have you been?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? What changed your mind?
ДЖОУИ: Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ha! I'm just messing with you.
ДЖОУИ: That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
МОНИКА: Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
ДЖОУИ: What? I get my own room?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
НЕДРУГ: No!
ДЖОУИ: Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
НЕДРУГ: After you, miss Banana Hammock.
ФИБИ: Thank you, mister Bag.
НЕДРУГ: Oh hey, how are you?
ФИБИ: Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
ФИБИ: Er, Rita, this is my husband.
НЕДРУГ: Oh!
ФИБИ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you tell her my name?
ФИБИ: Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
НЕДРУГ: Crap Bag?
НЕДРУГ: If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
НЕДРУГ: Okay. Excuse me...
ФИБИ: Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
НЕДРУГ: Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
ФИБИ: How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
НЕДРУГ: Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
ФИБИ: It's a funny word.
НЕДРУГ: It's a Speedo.
ФИБИ: ...Oh crap!
РОСС: Hey, is Rachel here?
МОНИКА: No.
РОСС: She's still at dinner?
МОНИКА: I guess. Why? Who's she with?
РОСС: That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
РОСС: We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
МОНИКА: So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me?
МОНИКА: Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
МОНИКА: Oh, sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi you guys!
РОСС: Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
РОСС: Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
РОСС: Should we send something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How did the job stuff go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He offered me one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's great!
РОСС: Congratulations!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
РОСС: Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The job is in Paris.
ДЖОУИ: I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.
