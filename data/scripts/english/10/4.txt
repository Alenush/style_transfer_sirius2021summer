НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
РОСС: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We're having a party.
РОСС: No.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, that day, that won't be her real birthday!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
РОСС: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
МОНИКА: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect, emotionally.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
РОСС: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I mean, you know, you guys. This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
МОНИКА: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party.
НЕДРУГ: Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
РОСС: Hey guys!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
ФИБИ: Oh, COOL! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
РОСС: Yeah!
ФИБИ: Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
РОСС: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
РОСС: Ah, and where is Joey?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I said it's still nap time.
РОСС: Hey, there is uncle Joey!
РОСС: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
РОСС: When they see this you'll be 52!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
ФИБИ: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
ФИБИ: Joey, it's a birthday party.
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, she's still napping.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
МОНИКА: All right, you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
МОНИКА: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
НЕДРУГ: HI!
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: So glad you came!
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe Emma is already one!
НЕДРУГ: Thank you!
НЕДРУГ: Which one are you?
МОНИКА: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, what are we gonna do?
МОНИКА: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
ФИБИ: Oh!
ФИБИ: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Emma might like what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What did you get her?
ФИБИ: Separate performances.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
ФИБИ: Sure, yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
РОСС: Oh, great!
ФИБИ: Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, ok, which one?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! That was amazing!
РОСС: Thank you so much for that gift!
НЕДРУГ: I was not ready for this today!
РОСС: Amazing, amazing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
ФИБИ: That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Is that it?
ФИБИ: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading. “Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no, no, no!
НЕДРУГ: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
НЕДРУГ: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be. Well your grandfather and I might not be here.
НЕДРУГ: That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
НЕДРУГ: After all, my parents died very young.
НЕДРУГ: And my cholesterol’s off the charts!
НЕДРУГ: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
НЕДРУГ: Ok, cut! Great. That was, that was just, yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
РОСС: Sure.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
МОНИКА: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
РОСС: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
НЕДРУГ: oh! Now it’s a party!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
НЕДРУГ: Uh, is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
НЕДРУГ: Jack, look at this.
НЕДРУГ: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
РОСС: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
РОСС: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. That is a weird sentence!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home. Joey, don't touch it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To be fair this one does have nuts.
РОСС: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
МОНИКА: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
РОСС: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
МОНИКА: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
МОНИКА: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
ФИБИ: And you know, I have a massage client soon.
РОСС: You guys, just please, a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember, the frosting? huh?
МОНИКА: Alright, 5 more minutes.
РОСС: Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you?. Ok, I'll be right there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Was that Emma? Is she up?
РОСС: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
ФИБИ: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
МОНИКА: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go, it's us We've been complaining the longest!
РОСС: No, wait! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
РОСС: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: To the bathroom!
ФИБИ: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
ФИБИ: No, it did not.
НЕДРУГ: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
НЕДРУГ: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
НЕДРУГ: Bye. Bye dear.
НЕДРУГ: Nighty-night!
ФИБИ: Joey? How could you just let them leave?
МОНИКА: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
НЕДРУГ: Joey! It's Estelle!
НЕДРУГ: So, how did your audition go today?
НЕДРУГ: The one I told you about last week?
НЕДРУГ: Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
ФИБИ: Wh, what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
МОНИКА: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
ФИБИ: Well, oh, ok now. Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
МОНИКА: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
МОНИКА: Ok, ten.
ФИБИ: No, lets just draw straws.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm begging you stop.
МОНИКА: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
ФИБИ: Yeah! Let's do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
МОНИКА: Everybody get your toys!
ФИБИ: Ok! I want the dolphin!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thats a bear.
ФИБИ: I'm too excited!
МОНИКА: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, on your mark. Get set. GO!
ФИБИ: Go! Go!
ДЖОУИ: Come on robot!
МОНИКА: What are you barking at?
МОНИКА: Wha. How the hell is that gonna help?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
ДЖОУИ: Way to go robot!
ФИБИ: Good job Alan!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, good race you guys.
ФИБИ: Yeah, see you later!
МОНИКА: No! No, no, wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They left.
НЕДРУГ: No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home. Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye.
РОСС: RACHEL!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OOH! God! Sorry!
РОСС: I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Emma's awake.
РОСС: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
РОСС: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday. And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
РОСС: Rach, she's not going to remember this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I guess. Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing Happy Birthday. Then we would all go into. HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER! They have to learn!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: It's not bad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! Look what, you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
РОСС: Well, I just made these two things uhm, cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I'm very impressed.
РОСС: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
НЕДРУГ: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
МОНИКА: Game?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh! That's my girl!
МОНИКА: That's how old you are.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did I teach her that? Did I just, impart wisdom?
МОНИКА: Ooh, I want one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
МОНИКА: and head to Canada!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was kidding.
МОНИКА: I wasn't. Let's get going!
ФИБИ: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, not yet.
ФИБИ: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
МОНИКА: What about your massage client?
ФИБИ: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
ДЖОУИ: I've been here the whole time!
РОСС: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
НЕДРУГ: Wo-ish.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
РОСС: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: NO, no science camp!
РОСС: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
МОНИКА: Thanks!
РОСС: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake. Well hey, well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let's do it, come on!
РОСС: What's wrong? Are you okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
ФИБИ: Hey, you made it into a bunny.
НЕДРУГ: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
РОСС: Okay, you ready?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: A-a-and, record.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really.
