НЕДРУГ: Previously on Friends.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How did the job stuff go?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He offered me one.
РОСС: You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: The job is in Paris.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
РОСС: So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Or facing a bitch of a commute.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's, really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
РОСС: Okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out. Anything we want.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
РОСС: All right, we'll work it out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Thank you! Thank you!
РОСС: Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think it is.
ФИБИ: Ooh, what's going on?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got a really incredible job offer.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, great! All right!
ФИБИ: Good for you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's in Paris.
ДЖОУИ: What? No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no. No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations!, and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.
МОНИКА: Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive.
ДЖОУИ: Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, you guys, this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
ФИБИ: Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, it would mean so.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey.
ФИБИ: You okay with this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it makes me feel sad, but.
ФИБИ: Talking to Ross.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see.
РОСС: Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
МОНИКА: I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
РОСС: Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
МОНИКА: How is that gonna happen?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
РОСС: I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
МОНИКА: You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
РОСС: I didn't say we were brothers.
МОНИКА: Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
МОНИКА: But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do you think Pheebs?
ФИБИ: Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins. Anyway. Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah.
ФИБИ: She died.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're kidding!
МОНИКА: That's terrible!
ФИБИ: Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah?
ФИБИ: Yeah, she was just an agent.
МОНИКА: Joey's gonna be so upset.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
ФИБИ: Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
МОНИКА: Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
ФИБИ: Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
МОНИКА: What if he reads it in the paper?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
РОСС: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
НЕДРУГ: Oh right, uhm, Don?
РОСС: Close. Ron.
НЕДРУГ: Uh. What can I do for you?
РОСС: Uhm, well. I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
РОСС: Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
НЕДРУГ: Wow, that is tempting.
РОСС: Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
НЕДРУГ: She is good!
РОСС: Huh, I took a shot there.
НЕДРУГ: But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. Ah, it's not true, there is, nothing I want to do.
РОСС: I see. Thanks very much. Is this your son?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
РОСС: Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
РОСС: How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
НЕДРУГ: You can really arrange that?
РОСС: You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
РОСС: Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
НЕДРУГ: That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
РОСС: He'll be fine.
ДЖОУИ: Hey Phoebe.
ФИБИ: Hey. Everything ok?
ДЖОУИ: I'm just mad at my agent.
ФИБИ: Estelle? Why?
ДЖОУИ: There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
ФИБИ: I'm guessing she does. Joey: Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
ФИБИ: Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
ДЖОУИ: Ok. Why?
ФИБИ: Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
ДЖОУИ: I love that saying!
ДЖОУИ: Hello?
НЕДРУГ: Joey, it's Estelle.
ДЖОУИ: I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
НЕДРУГ: It's a little coincidental, but believable. Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, actually I am!
НЕДРУГ: I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
ДЖОУИ: That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
НЕДРУГ: Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
НЕДРУГ: What are you saying?
ДЖОУИ: I'm saying that…. This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye.
ФИБИ: Man, tough week for Estelle!
РОСС: Hi.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
РОСС: Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
РОСС: Ok.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
РОСС: Nooo!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
РОСС: So, you're not going to Paris.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I'm still going.
РОСС: Wh… wh…what?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
РОСС: Yeeeah!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
МОНИКА: Thanks.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
МОНИКА: Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
НЕДРУГ: So? What do you think?
МОНИКА: Love it!
НЕДРУГ: Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
МОНИКА: They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Sure.
ФИБИ: Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
ФИБИ: No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
ДЖОУИ: I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
ФИБИ: No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.
ДЖОУИ: Why?
ФИБИ: Because patience is the road to understanding which, is the key, to a happy heart.
ДЖОУИ: You blow me away.
ФИБИ: All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
ДЖОУИ: I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And yet I never run into Beyonce!
НЕДРУГ: You two know each other?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't, don't!
МОНИКА: No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why!?
МОНИКА: I don't know why.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This can not be happening!
МОНИКА: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
МОНИКА: Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
МОНИКА: Okay, you come up with an idea.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
МОНИКА: But we love our house.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and Oh My God!
МОНИКА: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
НЕДРУГ: Who is it?
РОСС: It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
НЕДРУГ: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
РОСС: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
НЕДРУГ: Not good, Ron.
РОСС: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
НЕДРУГ: Wow, that's pretty cool.
РОСС: Huh? So? We have a deal?
НЕДРУГ: Okay, you got it.
РОСС: Yes! yes!
НЕДРУГ: This is gonna make me very popular.
РОСС: Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
НЕДРУГ: I meant with my son.
РОСС: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. Hello?
ФИБИ: Joey, it's Estelle.
ДЖОУИ: Estelle?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
ДЖОУИ: Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
ФИБИ: Well, I didn't think I should just drop by.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!
ФИБИ: Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
ДЖОУИ: Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
ФИБИ: It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. out of area. Boy, I'll say.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
НЕДРУГ: All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And. I'll see you later, neighbor.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wait! I just want you to know that. I'm so happy you're going to be here.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, me too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Because, that way, we can pick up where we left off.
НЕДРУГ: Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I never stopped loving you.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, my.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you. I need you. I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, what are you talking about?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
НЕДРУГ: I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, obviously we have this, heat between us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Obviously.
НЕДРУГ: But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
НЕДРУГ: Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I understand.
НЕДРУГ: Although, maybe just, one last moment of weakness. Goodbye Chandler Bing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're never coming down now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
РОСС: They did?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron. I don't even know what department that guy's in.
РОСС: So, what are you gonna do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I took it.
РОСС: That's great! So you're staying in New York!
НЕДРУГ: YAY! WHOO! YAY!
РОСС: You're excited, right?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice.
РОСС: Right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely. Oh.! Yeah, but you know, this is, it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can.
РОСС: Uhm, I hadn't no you. I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-toNewYork scared. Or uhm, when I-found-outI-was-gonna-haveEmma scared. But this is, fine. This is gonna be good.
РОСС: You should go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: It's what you want. You should go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You really think so?
РОСС: I really do.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I already told Zelner that I would come back.
РОСС: I'm sure he'll understand.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
РОСС: Then I'm happy too.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman....inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
