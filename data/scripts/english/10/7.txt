РОСС: Hey you guys!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey, what are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
РОСС: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
РОСС: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
НЕДРУГ: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
РОСС: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
НЕДРУГ: Are you serious?
НЕДРУГ: I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
РОСС: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe you do that next time you get married!
РОСС: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: What's going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
МОНИКА: We?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
МОНИКА: And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Little people?
ДЖОУИ: Celebrity.
МОНИКА: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What...? NO!
МОНИКА: Chandler?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
МОНИКА: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
МОНИКА: It isn't mine!
ДЖОУИ: Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
НЕДРУГ: May I help you?
НЕДРУГ: Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
НЕДРУГ: Well, this is very generous!
НЕДРУГ: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
НЕДРУГ: Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
НЕДРУГ: Not necessary.
НЕДРУГ: And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
НЕДРУГ: Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
НЕДРУГ: It does. It feels really good!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
РОСС: Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
РОСС: Oh, good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
РОСС: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely.
РОСС: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
РОСС: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, what!?
РОСС: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
РОСС: Be-caaauuuse...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
РОСС: Seriously?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
РОСС: And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
РОСС: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
РОСС: Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right!
РОСС: Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
РОСС: Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok, ok, here we go.
МОНИКА: Ok.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
МОНИКА: We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…
МОНИКА: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
МОНИКА: That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
МОНИКА: That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
МОНИКА: Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
МОНИКА: Yay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you already gave all your money to charity!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t think you can do that!
МОНИКА: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, careful.
РОСС: Ok.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
РОСС: Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
РОСС: I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: Ready sweety?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
РОСС: Here we go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
РОСС: See, I told you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
РОСС: Oh, absolutely!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.
РОСС: Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
НЕДРУГ: We’re seriously asking for our money back?
НЕДРУГ: Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t think that that’s ever happened before.
НЕДРУГ: Gay, go.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I love your shirt!
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
НЕДРУГ: So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! This feels really good.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, it’s not my business, besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…
НЕДРУГ: She could have been talking about either one of us.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
МОНИКА: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you!
МОНИКА: Would you like something to drink?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, water would be fine.
МОНИКА: Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
НЕДРУГ: Your place is just lovely.
МОНИКА: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
НЕДРУГ: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
МОНИКА: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
НЕДРУГ: Oh...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: I just realized why I remember this place.
МОНИКА: Really? What is it?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
МОНИКА: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
НЕДРУГ: Yes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course it was!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: RAT BASTARD!
НЕДРУГ: So you're not friends with him?
НЕДРУГ: OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
ДЖОУИ: Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
НЕДРУГ: What was that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
РОСС: SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
РОСС: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
РОСС: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
РОСС: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright fine. I'll do it.
РОСС: Good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: If you hold a spider.
РОСС: WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: IF you hold a spider.
РОСС: I know.
ДЖОУИ: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
НЕДРУГ: What's going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
ДЖОУИ: Guys!?
МОНИКА: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
ДЖОУИ: What's going on?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
ДЖОУИ: Everything doesn't sound fine!
НЕДРУГ: Is he alright out there by himself?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
НЕДРУГ: Bert and Ernie!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can't make this stuff up!
НЕДРУГ: You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
НЕДРУГ: Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
НЕДРУГ: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
НЕДРУГ: Monica and Chandler's. They are preparing to show Laura around. Laura is standing with her back to the window, Chandler and Monica are standing on either side of her, facing each other.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.
МОНИКА: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here...
МОНИКА: Why don't I show you the baby's room?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What the hell are you doing?
ДЖОУИ: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, we're not.
ДЖОУИ: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don't have a code word.
ДЖОУИ: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
МОНИКА: So that was the baby's room.
МОНИКА: What room should we see next?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Any room that isn't behind this couch!
МОНИКА: Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny! .
ДЖОУИ: I did not care for that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, ok!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: I forgot my bat.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing here?
ДЖОУИ: Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
НЕДРУГ: Are you friends with him?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can explain... Joey...
ДЖОУИ: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me?
ДЖОУИ: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
НЕДРУГ: I gave you my number, you never called me.
ДЖОУИ: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
ДЖОУИ: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
ДЖОУИ: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
НЕДРУГ: Joey, wait!
ДЖОУИ: NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, that's really ok.
МОНИКА: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
НЕДРУГ: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.
ДЖОУИ: LAURA!
НЕДРУГ: Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, we're here to give the money back.
НЕДРУГ: If I haven't said so already sir, congratulations!
НЕДРУГ: Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?
НЕДРУГ: You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
НЕДРУГ: Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
НЕДРУГ: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
НЕДРУГ: No!
МОНИКА: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wrong number?
МОНИКА: It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's great!
МОНИКА: Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
РОСС: Ok...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok...
РОСС: This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok... O-k...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
РОСС: See?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: A-alright! I can do this.
РОСС: There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's because he's on your neck.
РОСС: Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ROSS!
