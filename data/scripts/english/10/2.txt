НЕДРУГ: Sherry Bilsing-Graham &amp; Ellen Plummer Directed by: Ben Weiss Transcribed by: Kreidy
ДЖОУИ: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We weren't doing anything!
ДЖОУИ: Rach, he just saw us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shhh.
ДЖОУИ: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
НЕДРУГ: Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
ДЖОУИ: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
РЕЙЧЕЛ: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but it did happen, so...
ДЖОУИ: Ross?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross? Can we just close the door?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, say something. Anything.
РОСС: So you two are..?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: And have you .. ed?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no!
РОСС: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
ДЖОУИ: Probably.
ДЖОУИ: No, no!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
РОСС: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, but you know what I mean.
РОСС: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РОСС: Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
ДЖОУИ: Ross..
РОСС: It's all working out! Me &amp; Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Calm ourselves?
РОСС: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
ДЖОУИ: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
РОСС: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
ДЖОУИ: I do like fajitas.
МОНИКА: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: There's a hair in my coffee.
ФИБИ: Hey guys!
МОНИКА: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
МОНИКА: That's sweet. Drink your hair.
ФИБИ: Hey, what's all this stuff?
МОНИКА: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
ФИБИ: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
МОНИКА: That's not really how it works.
ФИБИ: Oh, how does it work?
МОНИКА: I don't know!
ФИБИ: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
МОНИКА: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
НЕДРУГ: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
НЕДРУГ: That's not what we talked about!!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Good to see you.
НЕДРУГ: Good to see you, too.
МОНИКА: Hi Frank.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, how you doin'?
МОНИКА: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
МОНИКА: Which one is which again?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
НЕДРУГ: "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
ДЖОУИ: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what would we be doing?
ДЖОУИ: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Feel me up?
ДЖОУИ: In a carriage!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, Charlie!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you bet.
ДЖОУИ: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
НЕДРУГ: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Oh. Oh, thanks.
НЕДРУГ: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
РОСС: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
РОСС: Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, actually, that's..
РОСС: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
НЕДРУГ: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
РОСС: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
ДЖОУИ: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
РОСС: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
ФИБИ: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
ФИБИ: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
НЕДРУГ: I haven't slept in four years!
ФИБИ: That's a, that's a long time.
НЕДРУГ: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
ФИБИ: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
НЕДРУГ: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
ФИБИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: No, I can't.
ФИБИ: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
ФИБИ: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
МОНИКА: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, please, we're happy to help.
НЕДРУГ: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, you have a lovely home.
МОНИКА: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
НЕДРУГ: Well, actually, I think this might help.
НЕДРУГ: It's pretty much all the information you need.
МОНИКА: Oh my god!
НЕДРУГ: Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
МОНИКА: Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
НЕДРУГ: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's great. Can I see the book?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
МОНИКА: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
НЕДРУГ: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
НЕДРУГ: I would have told him to do it too.
МОНИКА: Can I adopt you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you must be Owen.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
НЕДРУГ: You were?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
НЕДРУГ: Huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know how to use a compass?
НЕДРУГ: I have a badge in it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You do? That's fantastic!
НЕДРУГ: You wanna see it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
НЕДРУГ: What?!?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
НЕДРУГ: I'm adopted?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I got nothing.
РОСС: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
РОСС: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
РОСС: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No awareness.
РОСС: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
РОСС: My fajitas!!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
РОСС: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
РОСС: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
ФИБИ: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
НЕДРУГ: No, of course we're not.
ФИБИ: Insane.
НЕДРУГ: I know.
ФИБИ: Alice would never go for it, right?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
ФИБИ: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
НЕДРУГ: Huh.
ФИБИ: Frank Jr.Jr.?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
ФИБИ: Uh-huh.
НЕДРУГ: What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
ФИБИ: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
ФИБИ: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
ФИБИ: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
НЕДРУГ: How about tomorrow?
ФИБИ: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
НЕДРУГ: You'd do that for us?
ФИБИ: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
НЕДРУГ: Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where are Bill and Colleen?
МОНИКА: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have to leave!!
МОНИКА: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
МОНИКА: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
НЕДРУГ: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
НЕДРУГ: I'm adopted?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: See? Intuitive!
НЕДРУГ: What? Where did you hear that?
НЕДРУГ: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Which technically now you should give back!
НЕДРУГ: You told him he's adopted?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
НЕДРУГ: He isn't?!
НЕДРУГ: We have to get out of here, baby!
РОСС: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooy.
РОСС: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
РОСС: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, are you okay?
РОСС: Totally.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, you don't seem okay.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
НЕДРУГ: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
РОСС: No!
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
РОСС: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
НЕДРУГ: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
РОСС: Okay.
НЕДРУГ: Alright.
НЕДРУГ: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
НЕДРУГ: Bye.
РОСС: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
РОСС: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
РОСС: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
РОСС: I don't even know what that's for.
ДЖОУИ: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
ДЖОУИ: It doesn't look good, does it?
ДЖОУИ: Morning. Here you go.
РОСС: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
РОСС: So you took off my pants and shoes?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
РОСС: What do you mean?
ДЖОУИ: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
РОСС: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
ДЖОУИ: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
РОСС: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
ДЖОУИ: That's what I hear, yeah.
РОСС: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
ДЖОУИ: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
РОСС: Joey.
ДЖОУИ: I'm crazy about her.
РОСС: And she feels the same way?
ДЖОУИ: I think so.
РОСС: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
РОСС: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
РОСС: Yeah, I'm sure.
ДЖОУИ: And we're okay?
МОНИКА: Hey, Phoebs
ФИБИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: Still, he had to find out sometime.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
