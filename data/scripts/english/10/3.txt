ДЖОУИ: Yeah. It's actually our first official date
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
ДЖОУИ: Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
ДЖОУИ: It's OK!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How can you be so confident?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Like you have a routine?
ДЖОУИ: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
ДЖОУИ: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You mean like this?
ДЖОУИ: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
ДЖОУИ: More foosball?

НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: WOW!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
РОСС: I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
РОСС: Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
РОСС: Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why...why?
РОСС: Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
РОСС: So, do you get colours or just French tips?
РОСС: Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
ФИБИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Who's Amanda?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you trying to do a British accent?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
ФИБИ: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
ФИБИ: Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
ФИБИ: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
ФИБИ: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
РОСС: Well... I like how you look, what are you?
РОСС: Two, I think a two.
РОСС: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
РОСС: Well, I have a PhD, so...
РОСС: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
РОСС: You sprayed my front twice!
ДЖОУИ: I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
ДЖОУИ: What’s the matter?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!
НЕДРУГ: Okay
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, so sorry.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!
ДЖОУИ: I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
ДЖОУИ: Ok.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, was that good for you?
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
ФИБИ: Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
НЕДРУГ: Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
НЕДРУГ: Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.
ФИБИ: Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello? Is someone on the line?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, I was looking for Monica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hang on, she’s right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I get pedicures!
ФИБИ: Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
ФИБИ: Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
ФИБИ: I did!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
ДЖОУИ: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, let’s work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
ДЖОУИ: Ok, yeah, got it.
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: This thing welded shut?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow!
ДЖОУИ: Sorry!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well this is romantic!
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
ДЖОУИ: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
ДЖОУИ: NAH! I don't have another level!!
НЕДРУГ: Hold on! There is something different.
РОСС: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
РОСС: Oh! And it gets worse!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
РОСС: How do you count to five?
РОСС: Damnit!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: oooh! Oh oh!
РОСС: I Know!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How was your date with Joey?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You didn't like that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
ДЖОУИ: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You don't know!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: No.
ФИБИ: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
ФИБИ: Are you kidding, I love it!
ФИБИ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hello!
НЕДРУГ: It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
НЕДРУГ: Smell my neck! It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
ФИБИ: Musty!
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
НЕДРУГ: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .
НЕДРУГ: No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
ФИБИ: Well...kinda.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
ФИБИ: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
ФИБИ: Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
ДЖОУИ: Hey!

ДЖОУИ: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
ДЖОУИ: Oh! yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You like that? Let's take this into high gear
ДЖОУИ: uh uh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
ДЖОУИ: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
ДЖОУИ: Soldier down!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
ФИБИ: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
НЕДРУГ: Wow, my flat is twice this size!
ФИБИ: Please, Monica? In the hall?
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, aren't you a treat.
ФИБИ: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
ФИБИ: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
ФИБИ: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
ФИБИ: Yeah, I guess you're right.
НЕДРУГ: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
НЕДРУГ: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
РОСС: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
НЕДРУГ: Okay...
РОСС: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
РОСС: Which... which... which... Which one is it?
РОСС: OH! SON OF A BITCH!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is the matter with us?
ДЖОУИ: Well, I know what's the matter with me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
ДЖОУИ: I don't know.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Right, totally.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
ДЖОУИ: That's a... pla-an.
ДЖОУИ: Wow... I did not see this coming.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmmm... Me too...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
ДЖОУИ: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aah... I bet you're right.
ДЖОУИ: So...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: I love ya.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, me too.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
РОСС: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
РОСС: Really? Did you count Mississipily?
РОСС: Dude, you're not tanned.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, I just had to get a picture of this.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I see you later!
