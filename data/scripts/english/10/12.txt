НЕДРУГ: Michelle.
ФИБИ: Oh, hey Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, hey.
ФИБИ: Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Yeah. Well, uhm, listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and, uhm, well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
ДЖОУИ: So he can't come?
ФИБИ: No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and, well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
ДЖОУИ: Seriously?
ФИБИ: Yeah, you've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom.
ДЖОУИ: I am pretty wisdomous.
ФИБИ: So, what do you say?
ДЖОУИ: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
ФИБИ: Oh, thank you. I hope. I hope you know how much you mean to me.
ДЖОУИ: Listen, I hope, that you know. I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
ФИБИ: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
ФИБИ: Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello. Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don'tI don't, it doesn't matter to me!
МОНИКА: Well, it matters to me!
ФИБИ: Well, I don't care, so you pick!
МОНИКА: Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
ФИБИ: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
МОНИКА: You don't know military time?
ФИБИ: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
МОНИКА: Just subtract twelve.
ФИБИ: Ok, so. 1800 minus twelve is, one thousand, seven hundred and.
МОНИКА: Six o'clock!
ФИБИ: Ok.
МОНИКА: Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
ФИБИ: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
МОНИКА: Please, honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
ФИБИ: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
МОНИКА: Ooh, she backed out.
ФИБИ: She did? Why?
МОНИКА: I made her. Steel drums don't really say elegant wedding. Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
ФИБИ: Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
ФИБИ: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
ФИБИ: Rehearse it!
РОСС: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Thanks for coming you guys.
РОСС: Oh, hey, oh. I. I wasI was going for a hand shake.
НЕДРУГ: Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
РОСС: That is why!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: So Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Where is Emma?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
МОНИКА: Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, we are.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
НЕДРУГ: How's that?
ДЖОУИ: You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
НЕДРУГ: Who in God's name are you?
ДЖОУИ: Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
РОСС: Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh. November?
РОСС: I wanna say it's not looking good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey Pheebs.
ФИБИ: What's up?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uhm, you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Heh.
ФИБИ: Uhm, well, they're not in the wedding.
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
ФИБИ: I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so, you know, you were-you were, if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
РОСС: Oh, man!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean I mean the balance beam. Help me!
РОСС: FOOTBALL!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you.
МОНИКА: Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
ФИБИ: Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
МОНИКА: Yeah, I changed them. II sent you a fax about it!
ФИБИ: I don't have a fax machine.
МОНИКА: Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
РОСС: I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, I hate being left out of things.
РОСС: And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it.
НЕДРУГ: Hey guys, how is it going?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah look, about tomorrow, I. I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What happened?
РОСС: Who cares, AND?
НЕДРУГ: and I was wondering if, you know, maybe one of you guys.
РОСС: I'll do it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: MMe-me-me!
НЕДРУГ: You both wanna do it? Uhm, there's only room for one.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
РОСС: No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean, watch! Huh?
НЕДРУГ: You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
РОСС: Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror, as he is me!
РОСС: Please, you're going down!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You are going downer!
РОСС: Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
ДЖОУИ: So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
НЕДРУГ: I intend to marry her.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, a wiseacre. No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
НЕДРУГ: No more so than acting.
ДЖОУИ: Strike two!
НЕДРУГ: You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
ДЖОУИ: Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
РОСС: So, what did you decide?
ФИБИ: I decided to pee.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
ФИБИ: Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's. Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Goody, what is it!
ФИБИ: Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
ФИБИ: All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
РОСС: I'll do it!
МОНИКА: Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
НЕДРУГ: Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
МОНИКА: You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
НЕДРУГ: Is that what you say to Chandler?
МОНИКА: It's 2101 and I am not amused. Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
ФИБИ: Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I, oh I, hum. I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because, it's not important, she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know, it got, it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.
НЕДРУГ: oh God.
ФИБИ: And, moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm. Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to, that, to. Oh, ok, well, uhm, I. Ok, ok, I, ok, I. MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Happy wedding day!
ФИБИ: Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
МОНИКА: Hi. About last night. I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit. My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
ФИБИ: Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just, here as a bridesmaid.
МОНИКА: Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here. I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
ФИБИ: Wow, this is a lot!
МОНИКА: Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
ФИБИ: You won awards?
МОНИКА: Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hi.
РОСС: Where's Rach?
МОНИКА: She's in her room, why?
РОСС: I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What d'you want?
РОСС: You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
РОСС: I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
РОСС: Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
РОСС: YES, YES!
ФИБИ: Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
МОНИКА: I know.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word lorkins what flowers would that be?
НЕДРУГ: Orchids?
ФИБИ: Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
ДЖОУИ: Hello Michael.
НЕДРУГ: Joseph.
ДЖОУИ: May I have a word with you, please?
НЕДРУГ: This is, great.
ДЖОУИ: Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family, and instead, you disrespect me. I cannot allow this.
НЕДРУГ: Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
ДЖОУИ: More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.
НЕДРУГ: Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
ДЖОУИ: I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
НЕДРУГ: Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
ДЖОУИ: That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
НЕДРУГ: That must have been one lousy movie.
ДЖОУИ: That was ME!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel, insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right fine, I pick you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: YYYEEESSS! Make groom for Chandler.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my.
ФИБИ: No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
ДЖОУИ: I'm glad we had this little talk.
НЕДРУГ: Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
ФИБИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Bye.
НЕДРУГ: Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
ФИБИ: Oh my God, what's it doing here?
МОНИКА: Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
ФИБИ: Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
ДЖОУИ: How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How's it going?
РОСС: Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what I was doing too.
РОСС: Well, you have fun tonight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You too.
РОСС: Oh, I will.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Me too.
РОСС: Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not supposed to tell you.
РОСС: I'm not supposed to tell you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You told us both we could be in the wedding?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
РОСС: Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rach, Rach, knock knock.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who's there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll tell you at the wedding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, I forgot my scarf.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
РОСС: What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
ФИБИ: Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
МОНИКА: How's it going?
ФИБИ: Help me.
МОНИКА: What?
ФИБИ: I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
МОНИКА: Really?
ФИБИ: Please?
МОНИКА: You really want me to come back?
ФИБИ: More than I wanna get married.
МОНИКА: Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
ФИБИ: About what?
ДЖОУИ: The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
МОНИКА: Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
ДЖОУИ: I don't think they are.
РОСС: Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
МОНИКА: Well, the club lost it's power.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Since when do you watch the news?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
РОСС: I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
ФИБИ: I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
ФИБИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
ФИБИ: What do you think?
НЕДРУГ: I think I wanna get married to you today.
ФИБИ: Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
МОНИКА: AFFIRMATIVE!
МОНИКА: OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
НЕДРУГ: Michael!
НЕДРУГ: Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! Hi! Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of.
НЕДРУГ: No. It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
НЕДРУГ: I crushed a pill and put it in her drink. Come on, sweetheart.
НЕДРУГ: You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
НЕДРУГ: I guess.
НЕДРУГ: I'll do it!
РОСС: No, but Chandler, hello. Aren't you scared of dogs?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and. HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
РОСС: Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa. He stinks!
МОНИКА: Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no!
ДЖОУИ: Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
МОНИКА: Really?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh.
РОСС: Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
ДЖОУИ: I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but, yeah we do.
МОНИКА: Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll do it.
РОСС: I'll.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Na ha ha. Ne he he. Ah ah.
МОНИКА: Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
МОНИКА: Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
ФИБИ: Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
МОНИКА: So, you're ready to do this?
ФИБИ: Uhuh, uhuh. Oh my God! This is really happening.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
ФИБИ: Oh, thank you.
МОНИКА: I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses. Oh what the hell.
ФИБИ: I love you guys.
НЕДРУГ: I love you.
МОНИКА: Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
МОНИКА: I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah!
МОНИКА: Okay Marjorie, hit it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Geez Ross, you could have showered.
РОСС: It's the dog.
МОНИКА: Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ready?
ФИБИ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ФИБИ: Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
ФИБИ: I don't care. I'll be my something blue.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You look beautiful.
ФИБИ: Thank you.
НЕДРУГ: My God! Aren't you freezing?
ФИБИ: Na-ah.
ДЖОУИ: Friends, family, dog. Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place, so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here, when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
ФИБИ: When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need. You are my family.
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
ФИБИ: Oh wait, oh I forgot, and uhm. I love you, and you have nice eyes.
НЕДРУГ: I love you too.
РОСС: Uh Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah?
РОСС: Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
ФИБИ: I do.
ДЖОУИ: Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
НЕДРУГ: I do.
ДЖОУИ: I now pronounce you, husband and wife.
ФИБИ: I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That really was an incredible wedding.
ДЖОУИ: It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
ДЖОУИ: Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
РОСС: Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MAAKE! I did not sign on for this.
