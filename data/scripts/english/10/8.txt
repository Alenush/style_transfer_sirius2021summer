МОНИКА: Hey guys!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: We need to talk to you about something.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Hey!
РОСС: Are you kidding?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
РОСС: That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no! We made this decision together.
РОСС: She's putting words in your mouth!
ДЖОУИ: Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
МОНИКА: No, it's not!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's not? When was she born?
ФИБИ: Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
МОНИКА: Thank you, Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
МОНИКА: What? You are way off, lady!
ФИБИ: Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
МОНИКА: That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
МОНИКА: Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
ФИБИ: Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
МОНИКА: You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
ФИБИ: You're not making the pies yourself?
МОНИКА: No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you at least win the contest?
МОНИКА: 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can't wait!
МОНИКА: This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
ФИБИ: Hey Rach.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: What's Emma doing today?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
ФИБИ: Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
ФИБИ: Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
ФИБИ: Oh... okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And a thousand dollars.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
ФИБИ: Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
ФИБИ: Well, I was thinking...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
ФИБИ: Yeah!
МОНИКА: Did someone drop the baton again?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
МОНИКА: I don't get older. I just get better!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
МОНИКА: You don't know that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Somebody is gonna pick us.
МОНИКА: Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
МОНИКА: Name one of his books.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: "The Firm"?
МОНИКА: Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
МОНИКА: Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
МОНИКА: Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Tell me more.
МОНИКА: Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
РОСС: Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
ДЖОУИ: Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
РОСС: Dude, I wanted him to guess.
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, they're great seats too!
РОСС: Guess where they are?
ДЖОУИ: Center ice.
РОСС: Did I do something to you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hmm, the game's at one.
РОСС: So?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
ДЖОУИ: So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, two times that happened!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
РОСС: He's right, man.
ДЖОУИ: Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
ДЖОУИ: That's some gentle comedy, dude.
РОСС: We're still going at the game, right?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
ФИБИ: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
ФИБИ: We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
ФИБИ: Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
ФИБИ: But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, you have to calm down.
ФИБИ: Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You heard them say that?
ФИБИ: Yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
ФИБИ: Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, what?
ФИБИ: Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
ФИБИ: Why not!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because I already did!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
РОСС: Oh! What a game, huh?
ДЖОУИ: I know, yeah.
РОСС: I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
РОСС: Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
ДЖОУИ: Ohhhh! These seats are great!
РОСС: I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
ДЖОУИ: Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
РОСС: Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
ДЖОУИ: I don't know...
РОСС: One more fight!
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
РОСС: Okay.
МОНИКА: Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
ДЖОУИ: How late are we?
РОСС: Forty-five minutes.
ДЖОУИ: Wow
РОСС: Here!
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
РОСС: You may want to lose the foam finger!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
РОСС: Hey!
ФИБИ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: You are not at Thanksgiving?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No...
ФИБИ: No, we're late!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What are you doing here!
РОСС: We're late too!
ДЖОУИ: We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
ФИБИ: Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
РОСС: So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, where were you!
РОСС: Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
ФИБИ: Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And I won!
РОСС: You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
РОСС: Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. That's me!
РОСС: You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
ФИБИ: And it looks like she put makeup on her!
ДЖОУИ: Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
РОСС: I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She won a thousand dollars!
РОСС: So this is an annual thing?
ДЖОУИ: Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
ФИБИ: You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
РОСС: Yeah. What are we gonna do?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
ДЖОУИ: All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
ФИБИ: Alright, what are we gonna say?
РОСС: Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
ФИБИ: Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
ДЖОУИ: No. Here
РОСС: HEY!
МОНИКА: Do you hear something?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They're out there!
МОНИКА: Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
МОНИКА: Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross' shirt is torn.
МОНИКА: Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
РОСС: I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
ФИБИ: We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
РОСС: That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
РОСС: We know you're out there.
ДЖОУИ: Who do you think its from?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
РОСС: Well, let's just go in there and face them.
ФИБИ: Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
ДЖОУИ: I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .
ДЖОУИ: Ah-haah! I win!!
РОСС: What is that?
ДЖОУИ: That's fire. Beats everything.
ФИБИ: Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .
ДЖОУИ: Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, okay.
ФИБИ: It's locked.
РОСС: Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
МОНИКА: No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
МОНИКА: Nothing. It's fine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh thank God!
РОСС: Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
РОСС: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
ДЖОУИ: I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
МОНИКА: That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
РОСС: How are we gonna decide who gets this?
ДЖОУИ: WATER BALLOON!
ФИБИ: What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah!
МОНИКА: Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
РОСС: That's worse than no food.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
МОНИКА: Stinky?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Please let me stay on this side of the door.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
ФИБИ: Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
ДЖОУИ: Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
РОСС: I don't know...
ДЖОУИ: I'm telling ya... I can do it.
РОСС: Yeah, he can do it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The cranberries...?
МОНИКА: Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
ДЖОУИ: Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
ДЖОУИ: Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
РОСС: I feel terrible.
НЕДРУГ: So, so sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The floating heads do make a good point.
МОНИКА: Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So bad.
НЕДРУГ: So bad.
ФИБИ: So bad.
МОНИКА: Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dessert?
МОНИКА: Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
ФИБИ: Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
МОНИКА: Grand Supreme Little Darling?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Congratulatioooons!
МОНИКА: Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
РОСС: Really girls, not cool.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
ДЖОУИ: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
РОСС: It's a day to be thankful.
ДЖОУИ: Don't make me come up there!
МОНИКА: It's too late for apologies.
ДЖОУИ: Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ewww, is that what that is?
ДЖОУИ: Sorry!
ФИБИ: Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah! I'll cook!
РОСС: Yeah! Let's go out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
МОНИКА: The three of us?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
ДЖОУИ: Ha!
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
МОНИКА: Joey, that is not gonna work.
ДЖОУИ: No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
ФИБИ: I'll pull you through.
РОСС: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: A little late for that.
ДЖОУИ: Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
МОНИКА: Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
МОНИКА: Bring it.
ДЖОУИ: I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
МОНИКА: Here you go!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, that smells good!
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
МОНИКА: Okay, try it.
ДЖОУИ: It isn't working.
МОНИКА: Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
ДЖОУИ: Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can you ever feel your ears?
ДЖОУИ: Interesting...
МОНИКА: Chandler, where are your tools?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
МОНИКА: I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I lent them to Ross.
РОСС: I gave them to Joey.
ДЖОУИ: I left them at the park.
МОНИКА: Oh!
РОСС: I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
ФИБИ: I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
РОСС: Nice!
МОНИКА: Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
ДЖОУИ: It's really starting to hurt.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
ФИБИ: Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
ДЖОУИ: Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Come on guys, PUSH!
ДЖОУИ: Yeah! Come on!
НЕДРУГ: PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: My cranberries!
ДЖОУИ: Man, I've got food all over me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
МОНИКА: I don't care.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's going on?
МОНИКА: That was the adoption agency...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And?
МОНИКА: WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Are you serious?
МОНИКА: There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm so happy for you!
МОНИКА: This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
