НЕДРУГ: Marta Kauffman amp David Crane Directed by: Kevin Bright Transcribed by: Kreidy.
НЕДРУГ: Previously on Friends.
МОНИКА: Erica, are you okay?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
МОНИКА: She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
РОСС: Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?!
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shh. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
РОСС: Oh. This was amazing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It really was. You've learned some new moves!
РОСС: Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me Sex for Dummies as a joke.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah.
РОСС: Who's laughing now?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know!
МОНИКА: Breathe, breathe, breathe. Good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Next time, can I say breathe?
МОНИКА: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
НЕДРУГ: No, I'm okay.
МОНИКА: Alright, I'll be right back.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where are you going?
МОНИКА: To use the bathroom.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You can't leave me alone with her.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
МОНИКА: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
МОНИКА: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, ah. Any plans for the summer?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
НЕДРУГ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
ФИБИ: Morning.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: What's that?
ДЖОУИ: It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
ФИБИ: It's a baby chick and duck!
ДЖОУИ: Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
ФИБИ: I did not see that coming.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
ФИБИ: Yes.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
ФИБИ: That is the rule, though.
ФИБИ: Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
РОСС: What?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
РОСС: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
РОСС: Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
ФИБИ: Have you seen him throw a ball?
РОСС: Is Rachel here?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
РОСС: Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
ФИБИ: What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
РОСС: Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God. You and Rachel?
РОСС: I know, it's pretty great.
ДЖОУИ: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
РОСС: Oh, I. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
ФИБИ: But do you wanna get back together?
РОСС: I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
ФИБИ: YAY!
РОСС: Shhh!
ФИБИ: Yay!
ДЖОУИ: So, so is she still going to Paris?
РОСС: Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
ФИБИ: Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! Daa - raa. When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Morning!
ФИБИ: Guess we'll never know how it ends.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
РОСС: Hey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey.
РОСС: Hey. How did you sleep?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Good. You?
РОСС: Good.
ДЖОУИ: I bet you did!
РОСС: Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
ДЖОУИ: Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Chick and the duck? Didn't they die.
ФИБИ: Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
РОСС: So.
РОСС: Morning.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You too. Last night was just wonderful.
РОСС: It really was.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
РОСС: I know, me too. It was. You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
МОНИКА: It's just a little bit more, honey.
НЕДРУГ: Help me! This hurts!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it really that bad?
НЕДРУГ: Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
НЕДРУГ: The baby's head is crowning.
МОНИКА: Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm okay.
МОНИКА: Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
НЕДРУГ: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders.
МОНИКА: It's a. It's a boy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow!
НЕДРУГ: Is he okay?
НЕДРУГ: He's just fine.
МОНИКА: Oh, you did it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
НЕДРУГ: Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that's spongy.
МОНИКА: Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. He has your eyes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
НЕДРУГ: We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
НЕДРУГ: I'm really happy for you guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you feel?
НЕДРУГ: I'm tired!
НЕДРУГ: Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
МОНИКА: I. I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
НЕДРУГ: The next baby should be along in a minute.
МОНИКА: We only ordered one!
НЕДРУГ: You know it's twins, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
МОНИКА: Wait, did you know it was twins?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
МОНИКА: Anybody tell you?
НЕДРУГ: I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
МОНИКА: This is unbelievable.
НЕДРУГ: Twins actually run in my family.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What do we do?
МОНИКА: What do you mean what do we do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Twins! Twins!
МОНИКА: Chandler, you're panicking!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
МОНИКА: We can't split them up!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
МОНИКА: Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
МОНИКА: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
МОНИКА: That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of Eight is Enough comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay. Shhh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Okay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay!
НЕДРУГ: It looks like we're about ready over here.
НЕДРУГ: Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
НЕДРУГ: Ow!
НЕДРУГ: Here she comes!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She? It's a girl?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
РОСС: And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God! What did you say?
РОСС: Nothing! What do you say to that?
ФИБИ: Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
РОСС: No way!
ДЖОУИ: You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
РОСС: What?
ДЖОУИ: Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
ФИБИ: Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
РОСС: You really think so?
ФИБИ: I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ФИБИ: Can't a girl finish a song around here?
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
РОСС: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
ФИБИ: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
РОСС: Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
ДЖОУИ: Ross, wait!
РОСС: What? What?
ДЖОУИ: Could you get me a muffin?
НЕДРУГ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
НЕДРУГ: I. I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
НЕДРУГ: I. I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Gunther. Oh. I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Bye guys.
РОСС: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Unbelievable!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, you know what might help?
РОСС: I'm not getting you a muffin!
МОНИКА: Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
НЕДРУГ: We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
МОНИКА: There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, that's just like my name!
МОНИКА: Son of a gun, it is!
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
МОНИКА: Okay, well, bye!
НЕДРУГ: Bye!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bye!
МОНИКА: We'll call you!
НЕДРУГ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Have fun at church-camp!
МОНИКА: Oh, look at these little bunnies!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know! You ready to trade?
МОНИКА: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay.
МОНИКА: Alright, let's see.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We could trade later.
МОНИКА: Yeah, I'm good.
ФИБИ: Hey, what are you working on?
ДЖОУИ: It's a. It's a welcome home sign for the baby.
ФИБИ: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
ДЖОУИ: No, I sat in the paint.
РОСС: Hey.
ФИБИ: Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
РОСС: No, and I'm not going to.
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Why not?
РОСС: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
ФИБИ: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
РОСС: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes.
ФИБИ: Uh, Joe?
ДЖОУИ: Damn it!
РОСС: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
ФИБИ: No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's. It's a city of Gunthers!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey! What do you have there?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.
РОСС: Oh my God! You did that yourself?
ФИБИ: Honey, that's gorgeous!
ДЖОУИ: You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
ДЖОУИ: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
ФИБИ: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God!
РОСС: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi! Oh my gosh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, so what is the big surprise?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РОСС: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What. What.
РОСС: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
МОНИКА: Yes, it's twins!
РОСС: Oh my God.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
МОНИКА: This is a boy, and that's a girl.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Her name is Erica.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aw.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
МОНИКА: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
РОСС: Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
ФИБИ: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
НЕДРУГ: I want one.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
НЕДРУГ: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
ФИБИ: One? How about a whole bunch?
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
МОНИКА: I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
МОНИКА: I love you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I love you.
МОНИКА: Call us when you get there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I will. Ross, come here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just want you to know. Last night. I'll never forget it.
РОСС: Neither will I.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
ФИБИ: So, you just let her go?
РОСС: Yeah.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, maybe that's for the best.
РОСС: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. You know? You just. Look, you gotta. You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
ФИБИ: But now she'll never know how he feels!
ДЖОУИ: Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents. Right?
ДЖОУИ: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
РОСС: Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РОСС: I don't! I wanna be with her.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you are!
ФИБИ: Woo!
ФИБИ: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
РОСС: My coat.
ДЖОУИ: This is so cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
ДЖОУИ: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
РОСС: I don't know, but I. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
ФИБИ: You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
РОСС: Okay, guys, wish me luck.
ФИБИ: Hurry!
ДЖОУИ: Good luck, good luck!
РОСС: There's no seatbelt!
ФИБИ: That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
РОСС: Alright, alright, let's do this!
ФИБИ: Okay!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: 18th and East End.
ФИБИ: I - I don't take passengers.
НЕДРУГ: Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
РОСС: No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
НЕДРУГ: Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
ФИБИ: My medallion number is, Get out of the cab!
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Get out of the cab!
ФИБИ: Get out of the cab!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
МОНИКА: Now, that you can do.
ДЖОУИ: Alright!
ДЖОУИ: Ah. Chick Jr? Duck Jr? Don't hide from mama!
ФИБИ: You can open your eyes now.
РОСС: Are we off the bridge?
ФИБИ: Yes.
РОСС: Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
ФИБИ: Yes, she jumped right back up.
РОСС: Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
ФИБИ: Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
РОСС: Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
ФИБИ: You should have thought of that before you got in!
ФИБИ: Toll-booth.
РОСС: What?
ФИБИ: Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
ФИБИ: Hurry!
РОСС: Okay!
ФИБИ: Okay.
ФИБИ: Damn, that window is clean.
ДЖОУИ: Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
МОНИКА: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
МОНИКА: Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Alright.
МОНИКА: Oh God! What did I just step on?
ДЖОУИ: Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
МОНИКА: Oh.
ДЖОУИ: You stepped on my egg roll?
МОНИКА: I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
ДЖОУИ: Just put it on a plate and leave.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, let's find these birds.
ДЖОУИ: Alright.
ДЖОУИ: Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
ДЖОУИ: Oh! They're in the table!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, that can't be good!
ДЖОУИ: We gotta get them out of there!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
ДЖОУИ: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, wait! The ball!
ДЖОУИ: Oh!
ДЖОУИ: Oh God! So what do we do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
ДЖОУИ: Okay.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No. It's all glued together.
ДЖОУИ: Does that mean we have to bust it open?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. Maybe.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know! It's. It's the foosball table.
ДЖОУИ: All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life my time-machine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Did that movie ever get made?
ДЖОУИ: It did not.
ФИБИ: Ross, where are you going?
РОСС: To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
ФИБИ: What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
РОСС: Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
ФИБИ: You have to get a ticket to get past security.
РОСС: What? We're never gonna make it!
ФИБИ: Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
РОСС: Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
НЕДРУГ: Madame, your passport please?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
НЕДРУГ: Your boarding pass, please.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
НЕДРУГ: Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
НЕДРУГ: Madame, you must have your boarding pass.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
РОСС: Hey, I need a ticket.
ФИБИ: Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
РОСС: Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
ФИБИ: We're on our honeymoon.
НЕДРУГ: And the destination?
РОСС: I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
ФИБИ: I'm so lucky I married you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
РОСС: Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
ФИБИ: No, did we miss it?
РОСС: No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
ФИБИ: Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
МОНИКА: Hello.
ФИБИ: Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
РОСС: What? Hey, hey, listen.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
РОСС: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica?
МОНИКА: Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
РОСС: That's alright. Listen, listen.
МОНИКА: Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
РОСС: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica?
МОНИКА: Isn't that cute?
РОСС: That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
МОНИКА: Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
РОСС: Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
МОНИКА: That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
РОСС: What?
МОНИКА: Newark airport. Why, where are you?
РОСС: JFK.
ДЖОУИ: Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Here goes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What's the matter?
ДЖОУИ: I need to say goodbye to the table first.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I understand.
ДЖОУИ: Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel. All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't know. Except that, for one last time. Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
ДЖОУИ: Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I can't do it either.
МОНИКА: Hey! Did you find them?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
МОНИКА: Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
РОСС: Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
ФИБИ: Well, I've never gone this fast before.
РОСС: Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
ФИБИ: She's got her cell, you could call her.
РОСС: I am not doing this over the phone.
ФИБИ: You don't have any other choice!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello?
ФИБИ: Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
РОСС: Yay.
ФИБИ: Uh, Rach, hang on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe? Is everything okay?
ФИБИ: Uhm, actually no. No, you've. You have to get off the plane.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Why?
ФИБИ: I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
НЕДРУГ: Uhm, what was that?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, that doesn't sound good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
НЕДРУГ: But she is sometimes.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, what are you doing?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I can't take this plane now.
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
НЕДРУГ: I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Could I get some peanuts?
НЕДРУГ: What's wrong with the plane?
НЕДРУГ: There's nothing wrong with the plane.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! The left Philange!
НЕДРУГ: There is no Philange!
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
НЕДРУГ: I'm not flying on it!
НЕДРУГ: Ma'am, please sit down!
НЕДРУГ: What's going on?
НЕДРУГ: We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is ridiculous! I.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, okay.
МОНИКА: Alright. My job here is done.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That was. Impressive.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
МОНИКА: Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sorry about the table, man.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You gonna buy a new one?
ДЖОУИ: Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, at least we got these little guys out.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
ДЖОУИ: I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
ДЖОУИ: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
ДЖОУИ: I could get a goose!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
ДЖОУИ: Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
ДЖОУИ: Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
НЕДРУГ: And you fixed the Philange?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
РОСС: Where is she?
ФИБИ: I don't see her.
РОСС: Rachel! Rachel Green!
ФИБИ: There she is!
РОСС: Rachel! Rachel!
НЕДРУГ: Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
РОСС: No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
РОСС: No, no, no, but.
ФИБИ: RACHEL!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God. What. What are you guys doing here?
ФИБИ: Okay, you're on.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
РОСС: Okay, the thing is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
РОСС: Don't go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God.
РОСС: I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
НЕДРУГ: Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
РОСС: Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
НЕДРУГ: Miss?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I - I have to get on the plane.
РОСС: No, you don't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, I do.
РОСС: No, you don't.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
РОСС: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm so sorry.
РОСС: I really thought she'd stay.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry.
МОНИКА: Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow, this is weird.
МОНИКА: I know.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
МОНИКА: I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
ДЖОУИ: I love you!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey.
ДЖОУИ: So did you guys make it in time?
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's Ross?
ФИБИ: He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things. And. And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
РОСС: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me?
НЕДРУГ: Miss? Please, sit down!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
НЕДРУГ: Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
РОСС: Let her off the plane!
НЕДРУГ: I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
РОСС: Try to understand!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off.
РОСС: No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I got off the plane.
РОСС: You got off the plane.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I do love you.
РОСС: I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
РОСС: Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
РОСС: This is it. Unless we're on a break.
РОСС: Don't make jokes now.
МОНИКА: Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
МОНИКА: If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
РОСС: Wow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. It seems smaller somehow.
ДЖОУИ: Has it always been purple?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
ФИБИ: Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
МОНИКА: Oh, yeah, that's true.
РОСС: Uh, I haven't.
МОНИКА: Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
РОСС: Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
МОНИКА: Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, okay.
ФИБИ: So, I guess this is it.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. I guess so.
МОНИКА: This is harder than I thought it would be.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, it's gonna be okay.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
МОНИКА: We got some time.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay, should we get some coffee?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure. Where?
