НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Pheebs, what's wrong?
ФИБИ: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
НЕДРУГ: OH!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My God!
РОСС: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
ФИБИ: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
ДЖОУИ: Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
НЕДРУГ: Whoo!
ФИБИ: Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mmh-mmh!
ФИБИ: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
ФИБИ: I would, but you're the last one.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
ФИБИ: Oh, my first love!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
МОНИКА: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
ФИБИ: Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
ФИБИ: Oh yes, they are.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey honey!
ДЖОУИ: Hi sweetie!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is Monica not here?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
ДЖОУИ: Cool!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
ДЖОУИ: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
ДЖОУИ: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
ДЖОУИ: I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
ДЖОУИ: I'm cold!
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
НЕДРУГ: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
РОСС: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
НЕДРУГ: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
РОСС: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
НЕДРУГ: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
РОСС: Yeah. Why?
НЕДРУГ: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
РОСС: Your ex-boyfriend?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
РОСС: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
НЕДРУГ: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
РОСС: Well, if you think it would help.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
РОСС: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
НЕДРУГ: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
РОСС: We'll see how dinner goes.
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
ФИБИ: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
МОНИКА: Oh, right.
ФИБИ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
ФИБИ: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
МОНИКА: Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
ФИБИ: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
МОНИКА: Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
ФИБИ: Why, you don't like her?
МОНИКА: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
ФИБИ: Really? You think?
МОНИКА: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
ФИБИ: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
МОНИКА: Damn it, I did not think this through!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey you guys.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Oh! Any word on casting yet?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
ДЖОУИ: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
НЕДРУГ: Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joe...
ДЖОУИ: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fine!
ДЖОУИ: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Work, Joe!
ДЖОУИ: Damn it!
НЕДРУГ: What am I gonna do now?
ДЖОУИ: Just pass it to your boss!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
НЕДРУГ: Sorry, looks like it's just him.
НЕДРУГ: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
РОСС: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
НЕДРУГ: So good to see you.
НЕДРУГ: Me too.
РОСС: I'm ok.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
РОСС: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
НЕДРУГ: Shall we? .
НЕДРУГ: Thank you! . I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! .
НЕДРУГ: You weren't there!
РОСС: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
НЕДРУГ: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?
НЕДРУГ: So, tell me about it.
РОСС: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
НЕДРУГ: M-m.
РОСС: See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
НЕДРУГ: Break up with Charlie!
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
НЕДРУГ: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
РОСС: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
РОСС: Are you serious?
НЕДРУГ: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
РОСС: No!
НЕДРУГ: Joking it is!
ФИБИ: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
МОНИКА: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
ФИБИ: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
МОНИКА: Wow, what's the bad news!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who's Gladys?
ФИБИ: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
ФИБИ: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
МОНИКА: Huh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
МОНИКА: You know, I would give her up, for you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, I couldn't let you do that.
МОНИКА: But I want to.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I don't want you to.
МОНИКА: But I insist!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But I insist harder!
ФИБИ: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!
МОНИКА: No, that landed in your food!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe!
ДЖОУИ: What's up?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
ДЖОУИ: Oh.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sorry man.
ДЖОУИ: But, ehm... you watched the tape?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
ДЖОУИ: You didn't watch the tape.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What!? Of course I did!
ДЖОУИ: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
ДЖОУИ: Well, you lied again!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I watched it!
ДЖОУИ: Keep going Pinocchio!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I did!
ДЖОУИ: No you didn't!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you watch the tape?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No!
НЕДРУГ: The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
НЕДРУГ: Interesting.
РОСС: I guess!
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?
НЕДРУГ: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
НЕДРУГ: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
РОСС: What? I... I...
НЕДРУГ: Care to venture a guess?
РОСС: May 12th?
НЕДРУГ: That's not even kinda close! Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
НЕДРУГ: Half a dozen.
НЕДРУГ: I see, and Dr. Biely?
НЕДРУГ: Three for excavation and two for analysis.
НЕДРУГ: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
РОСС: Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
НЕДРУГ: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
РОСС: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
НЕДРУГ: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
РОСС: um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
РОСС: Ok. B - O - S ...
НЕДРУГ: No, it starts with a silent "M".
РОСС: Oh come on!!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But you are a liar.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did I just say?
ДЖОУИ: You still here?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
ДЖОУИ: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
ДЖОУИ: You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, this is going well.
ДЖОУИ: Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
НЕДРУГ: And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
ЧЕНДЛЕР: He really is a chameleon.
ФИБИ: Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
МОНИКА: Oh, my!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
НЕДРУГ: I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
МОНИКА: I like that poster!
ФИБИ: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
МОНИКА: Are you still here?
НЕДРУГ: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
НЕДРУГ: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
РОСС: No! Stop!
НЕДРУГ: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
РОСС: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
РОСС: I have to break up with Charlie?
НЕДРУГ: Hey, you got one right!
РОСС: You're crazy.
НЕДРУГ: Crazy, or... romantic?
РОСС: Crazy!
НЕДРУГ: Ooor...
РОСС: Get out!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: O-oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
ДЖОУИ: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, we're not keeping this!
ДЖОУИ: But it's an original Buffay...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
ДЖОУИ: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
ДЖОУИ: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
МОНИКА: Hey! I sold that to Joey.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
МОНИКА: No, too late. You can't give it back!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes I can!
МОНИКА: No you can't. She's yours!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's yours!
МОНИКА: SHE'S YOURS!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's yours!
ФИБИ: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's mine!
МОНИКА: She's m-i-i-ne!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's mine!
МОНИКА: She's mine!
ФИБИ: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I want Gladys!
МОНИКА: She's mine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's mine!
МОНИКА: She's mine!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: She's mine!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
ДЖОУИ: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excellent!
ДЖОУИ: Now, what do you say?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Lying is wrong!
ДЖОУИ: And?... AND?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm a pretty little girl.
ФИБИ: I knew it!
РОСС: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
НЕДРУГ: Did you get the grant?
РОСС: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
НЕДРУГ: What?
РОСС: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
НЕДРУГ: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
РОСС: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
НЕДРУГ: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
РОСС: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
НЕДРУГ: Seriously?
РОСС: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
НЕДРУГ: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
РОСС: Damnit!
НЕДРУГ: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
РОСС: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
НЕДРУГ: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
РОСС: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
НЕДРУГ: Benji?
НЕДРУГ: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
РОСС: Too little, too late, Benji!
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe this.
НЕДРУГ: I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
РОСС: No!
НЕДРУГ: Yes!
РОСС: What?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
РОСС: or...
НЕДРУГ: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
НЕДРУГ: Maybe...
РОСС: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
НЕДРУГ: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry too...
НЕДРУГ: I love you!
НЕДРУГ: I love you too!
РОСС: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
ДЖОУИ: Gladys?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
ДЖОУИ: You're mean!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, don't be such a baby!
