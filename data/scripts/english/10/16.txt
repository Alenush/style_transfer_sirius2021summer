ДЖОУИ: All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
ДЖОУИ: Just flip!
НЕДРУГ: Ha, tails!
ДЖОУИ: Damnit!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that sounds good!
МОНИКА: Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's all done!
МОНИКА: Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
МОНИКА: Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Where's your passport?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It should be right next to my plane ticket.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, it's not.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
МОНИКА: Here, let me help you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
НЕДРУГ: At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
МОНИКА: Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
НЕДРУГ: I know.
МОНИКА: You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
НЕДРУГ: No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
РОСС: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
РОСС: Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
НЕДРУГ: That's because I'm pregnant!
РОСС: Right, no, I understand.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
РОСС: No, no, I knew .
НЕДРУГ: Okay, well, stop staring at them.
РОСС: She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
МОНИКА: Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
РОСС: Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
МОНИКА: Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
НЕДРУГ: Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
РОСС: Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
МОНИКА: Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
НЕДРУГ: I'll be right back.
РОСС: Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
МОНИКА: Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
РОСС: No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
МОНИКА: Yeah, it takes two incomes.
РОСС: Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
РОСС: Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
МОНИКА: Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
РОСС: What are you guys doing?
ДЖОУИ: Try it, I can't feel a thing!
НЕДРУГ: Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're taking a break!
МОНИКА: From?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Jumping on the bed?
МОНИКА: All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
РОСС: You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
ДЖОУИ: You guys hear a ringing?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What the hell is this?
ДЖОУИ: Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
РОСС: Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I didn't know Monica had these!
ДЖОУИ: Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
РОСС: Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
ФИБИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey! Where's Mike?
ФИБИ: Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
РОСС: Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
ФИБИ: Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
РОСС: Rock on!
НЕДРУГ: Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
МОНИКА: Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
РОСС: Hey, where's Rach?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
РОСС: Great.
ДЖОУИ: Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
МОНИКА: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: Hey Rach, hey you.
РОСС: Here she is!
НЕДРУГ: Hi you guys!
ДЖОУИ: What did I just say?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
МОНИКА: Come here, I'll make you a drink.
РОСС: Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
НЕДРУГ: You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
РОСС: Yeah?
ДЖОУИ: Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, Joe?
ДЖОУИ: I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
НЕДРУГ: You doing ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I've been better.
ФИБИ: Uh-hmm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
ФИБИ: Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm gonna miss you so much.
ФИБИ: I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
РОСС: Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
ДЖОУИ: Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
ФИБИ: Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, oh. . What is this?
ФИБИ: It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
МОНИКА: Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
МОНИКА: What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
МОНИКА: That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
МОНИКА: Rachel used to live in that room.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
МОНИКА: Joey's bare ass!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: . Well played.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I love you Phoebe.
ФИБИ: I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
ФИБИ: Ok.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Monica?
МОНИКА: Yeah?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can you come here with me for a minute?
МОНИКА: Sure.
ФИБИ: Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
МОНИКА: No.
ФИБИ: Oh, you're so screwed.
РОСС: Hey. What was that all about?
ФИБИ: She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
РОСС: Are you kidding? Oh my God...
ФИБИ: Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
РОСС: Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
МОНИКА: I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
МОНИКА: You're the best friend I ever had.
МОНИКА: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I... I... I...
МОНИКА: That is so sweet.
РОСС: Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Rach?
РОСС: Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
ДЖОУИ: I really made you think about that thing uh?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pheebs!
ФИБИ: Yeah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think these are yours.
ФИБИ: These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
ФИБИ: Where do you think Mike really is?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh honey...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay. Oh...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
МОНИКА: So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
РОСС: I don't think so.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
МОНИКА: You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
РОСС: God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
ФИБИ: I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, no, no!
РОСС: Okay, here we go...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... Well...
РОСС: Yeah...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think I'm gonna take off.
РОСС: Huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
РОСС: What? I don't get a goodbye?
ДЖОУИ: Lucky bastard!
РОСС: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
МОНИКА: Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
РОСС: Well, it needs to be plicit.
ДЖОУИ: All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
РОСС: No, I don't think so.
ФИБИ: You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
МОНИКА: Yeah. Mine too.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Mine was a humdinger
РОСС: O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
ФИБИ: Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
МОНИКА: And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
РОСС: THE HELL I DO!
РОСС: I don't get a goodbye?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross...
РОСС: Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
МОНИКА: I hope Ross isn't too upset.
ДЖОУИ: I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
ФИБИ: Tell me about it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
ФИБИ: All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
МОНИКА: Uh, where do you think you're going?
ФИБИ: I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
МОНИКА: We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
МОНИКА: Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You couldn't be cool.
МОНИКА: Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah.
МОНИКА: Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
МОНИКА: You did? How?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Let me see.
ДЖОУИ: Who's that dirty old lady?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica's grandmother.
МОНИКА: Nana liked it rough!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Come on here, have a seat.
ФИБИ: How was your night?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
МОНИКА: Erica, are you okay?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Relax! We just get her some antacids.
МОНИКА: She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh my God!
ФИБИ: Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
МОНИКА: All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, it's gonna be okay.
НЕДРУГ: You can do this. Just breathe.
МОНИКА: Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
НЕДРУГ: Ooh! Are you sure?
МОНИКА: Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
ДЖОУИ: Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What?
ДЖОУИ: If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
РОСС: That's what it seemed like.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
РОСС: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
РОСС: Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: You keep, you keep... You can't...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: WHAT?
ДЖОУИ: A little more.
ФИБИ: Okay.
ДЖОУИ: A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
ФИБИ: All right, ready?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
ФИБИ: All right, here it goes...
