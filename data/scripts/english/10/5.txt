ДЖОУИ: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
ДЖОУИ: No! No, and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
МОНИКА: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Of course, I'd be honored!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks!
МОНИКА: Thank you!
ДЖОУИ: UUUm, I think there's been an oversight.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
МОНИКА: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much with the words.
ДЖОУИ: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!
МОНИКА: Clearly we were wrong.
ДЖОУИ: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
МОНИКА: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start. Dear baby adoption decider people.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So excited about your letter!
ФИБИ: Hey!
НЕДРУГ: Hey Phoebe!
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
МОНИКА: Wow! Don't you look nice?!
ФИБИ: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex.
ФИБИ: YEAH!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
ФИБИ: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
ДЖОУИ: Uhm. Aren't you a little overdressed?
ФИБИ: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and. I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
МОНИКА: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's where people make number two!
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
РОСС: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: So, you know. I have a little time. If you, if you want to.
РОСС: Oh. Ohh. I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
НЕДРУГ: Fine, it's fine. I'll just shower by myself.
РОСС: B, B, B, B, B!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
РОСС: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
РОСС: Damnit!
НЕДРУГ: Rachel! Open up! It's your sister! I have to talk to you!
РОСС: Hi Amy!
НЕДРУГ: You're not Rachel.
РОСС: Still sharp as a tack!
НЕДРУГ: Um. Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
НЕДРУГ: Nice to meet you.
НЕДРУГ: HHi! And you are?
РОСС: Ross? I. I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year. I had a baby with your sister!
НЕДРУГ: N-no, uhm, did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
РОСС: Yes, yes, you did.
РОСС: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah! Hey, sure! The Days of Our Lives guy!
ДЖОУИ: That's right, yeah.
НЕДРУГ: You're not good!
ДЖОУИ: Always nice to meet a fan!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So now, what are you doing here?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I have huge news.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
НЕДРУГ: Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
РОСС: Ehm. Her name is Emma.
НЕДРУГ: Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
РОСС: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
НЕДРУГ: Hey, your English is getting better!
РОСС: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
РОСС: What, what you working on?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but. I don't know any big words or anything, so.
РОСС: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
ДЖОУИ: What did I just say?
РОСС: Watch. Here, you ehm. You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates. 'gives'. 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
ДЖОУИ: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart! No, no, I'm. brainy, bright, clever, I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!
НЕДРУГ: God!
НЕДРУГ: So beautiful.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I know, isn't she?
НЕДРУГ: No, I was talking about your bedding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right. What's your news, Amy?
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Um. Well. I'm getting married.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What? Oh my God! To who?
НЕДРУГ: This guy! He has a killer apartment.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: AAnd?
НЕДРУГ: AAnd it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, what's he like?
НЕДРУГ: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
НЕДРУГ: It's his dad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Huh, wow, so he's gotta be.
НЕДРУГ: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sweety, I gotta tell ya, it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like.
НЕДРУГ: Myron. Hmm. I told you he was old!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
НЕДРУГ: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
НЕДРУГ: You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna do it!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, let’s keep talking.
ФИБИ: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos, they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! Can’t believe it's been a whole year!
НЕДРУГ: I know. This has been the best year. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
ФИБИ: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
НЕДРУГ: I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
ФИБИ: YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
НЕДРУГ: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
ФИБИ: Oh how lame, oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
ФИБИ: Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!
НЕДРУГ: Excuse me.
ДЖОУИ: Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t, uh, understand.
ДЖОУИ: Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
МОНИКА: It doesn’t make any sense.
ДЖОУИ: Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: On every word?
ДЖОУИ: Yep!
МОНИКА: Alright, what was this sentence originally?
ДЖОУИ: Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
МОНИКА: Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
ДЖОУИ: Why not?
МОНИКА: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani. Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Amy, hi!
НЕДРУГ: I took your advice, I left Myron.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, good for you!
НЕДРУГ: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
НЕДРУГ: Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
ДЖОУИ: Ah, look who’s back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I’m staying with you guys!
ДЖОУИ: What?
НЕДРУГ: We’re gonna be roomies! Come on!
ДЖОУИ: You slept out here?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’
ДЖОУИ: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, I can’t do that!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said Uoh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips! I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
ДЖОУИ: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, it's just, look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, Monica made us!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, uhm, whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.
НЕДРУГ: Good morning.
ДЖОУИ: Yeaah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Oh, sure you wanna eat that?
ДЖОУИ: I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
ФИБИ: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
МОНИКА: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
РОСС: Seriously?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Word!
ФИБИ: Well, mine was worse than that.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, what happened?
ФИБИ: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that is so tacky.
ФИБИ: Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe, that’s huge!
РОСС: Well, do you wanna marry him?
ФИБИ: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She's right! If I were a guy and. Did I just say if I were a guy?
МОНИКА: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
ФИБИ: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
МОНИКА: I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ФИБИ: Well, do you think I should propose?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I think it could be kind of great!
РОСС: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
ФИБИ: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
МОНИКА: How about at a game, on the big screen?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uuuh! How about at a Footlocker?
МОНИКА: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
ФИБИ: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would, would you two like that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sounds good to me, but what would a guy think?
НЕДРУГ: Nana is on the phone.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!
НЕДРУГ: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh. God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
РОСС: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Menstrual cramps.
РОСС: I don't think that's what this is.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can any of you watch Emma?
МОНИКА: No, sorry sweety.
ФИБИ: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I can do it.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, actually.
РОСС: Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why not?
РОСС: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wha, the next one?
РОСС: Okay, um. I don't want her watching our baby.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!
РОСС: I. I don't know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
НЕДРУГ: um, listen, I couldn't help but overhear. 'cause I was trying to. Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Absolutely.
НЕДРУГ: Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
ДЖОУИ: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
МОНИКА: You dropped it off?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
ДЖОУИ: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
МОНИКА: You hand-wrote it?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
МОНИКА: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
МОНИКА: Okay good.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, okay, thank you. Good-bye.
МОНИКА: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They loved it.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
МОНИКА: They thought Joey was a child?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey, what did you guys do today?
НЕДРУГ: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That sounds like fun.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
НЕДРУГ: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah!
НЕДРУГ: Ta-daaa!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You pierced her ears!?
НЕДРУГ: Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
НЕДРУГ: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
НЕДРУГ: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I think she looks cute, but I am wrong!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
НЕДРУГ: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ugh.
РОСС: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nah, I don't really want her to see.
РОСС: Why not?
МОНИКА: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
РОСС: Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
РОСС: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Nothing.
РОСС: Hi! What. Please tell me those are clip-ons.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, they're real!
РОСС: Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
НЕДРУГ: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
МОНИКА: I'm a cool, fun aunt!
НЕДРУГ: OOkay!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
НЕДРУГ: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah? Since when?
НЕДРУГ: Since today. I am going to be a baby stylist.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: That's not a thing!
НЕДРУГ: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Babies don't care if they're slim.
НЕДРУГ: Enter Amy!
РОСС: Amy, I ju. I just. I just wanna.
НЕДРУГ: What? What are you gonna do?
РОСС: No more falafel for you!
НЕДРУГ: Great game, huh?
ФИБИ: Uhuh, uhuh.
НЕДРУГ: Why do you keep looking at the screen?
ФИБИ: I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win. Thank you Thor! Where, where are you going?
НЕДРУГ: Going go to the bathroom.
ФИБИ: Well, I think you should wait.
НЕДРУГ: Why?
ФИБИ: Well, if you don't, if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
НЕДРУГ: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
ФИБИ: Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?
НЕДРУГ: Get a load of this. She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
ФИБИ: That's not very enlightened!
ФИБИ: Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
ДЖОУИ: Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani. Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter. No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now. Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
ДЖОУИ: Whoo-hoo!
НЕДРУГ: You're kicking me out?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You put holes in my baby's ears!
НЕДРУГ: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
НЕДРУГ: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Excuse me?
НЕДРУГ: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Joey, where are those bags?
ДЖОУИ: She has a lot of crap!
НЕДРУГ: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill. Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Seriously?
НЕДРУГ: hm-mmm. Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hips or thighs?
НЕДРУГ: Ass and face.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
НЕДРУГ: She was. Carbs found her. See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I can give you that.
НЕДРУГ: You can?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're, you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Did you just say Emma?
НЕДРУГ: Ugh, I'm sorry. Ella.
ФИБИ: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
НЕДРУГ: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
ФИБИ: I would love it. Consider it forgotten. But just so you know, however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether, whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
ФИБИ: It's in the cake, isn't it?
НЕДРУГ: Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
ФИБИ: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
НЕДРУГ: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
НЕДРУГ: I'm gonna do this now.
ФИБИ: Oh my God!
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, I.
ФИБИ: Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
НЕДРУГ: Ready?
ФИБИ: Uh-huh!
НЕДРУГ: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me, three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you. Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
ФИБИ: Yes!
НЕДРУГ: I love you!
ФИБИ: I love you more!
НЕДРУГ: Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So how is the uhm, baby styling business going?
НЕДРУГ: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's shocking!
