НЕДРУГ: Mmh, this cake is amazing!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My God, get a room!
МОНИКА: I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
ФИБИ: If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
МОНИКА: Sex!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously, answer faster!
МОНИКА: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said sex I wasn't thinking about sex with you!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's like a giant hug.
ФИБИ: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
РОСС: Food.
ФИБИ: Ok, how about, uhm, sex or dinosaurs?
РОСС: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
ДЖОУИ: Uhm, oh. I don't know, it's too hard.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you gotta pick one!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! SeI don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
ФИБИ: Oh, how cute!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
ФИБИ: Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
ФИБИ: OH! He's having an affair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: He's not having an affair!
ФИБИ: You know, I'm always right about these things.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
ФИБИ: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello.
ФИБИ: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm. I know that Monica is working today so. I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uhm. I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
ФИБИ: Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either Liar, Liar or Betrayal, or. An Affair To Remember.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Those are all really old!
ФИБИ: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Dude, Where's My Car?
ФИБИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: They're in a caaar.
ФИБИ: Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Geez!
ФИБИ: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
ФИБИ: I got them!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi!
МОНИКА: Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I was in the car with Nancy all day.
МОНИКА: Nancy doesn’t smoke!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
МОНИКА: So? What do you think of the house?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
МОНИКА: Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
МОНИКА: Don’t you love the huge yard?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And the fireplace in the bedroom.
МОНИКА: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
МОНИКА: So? Do you think we should get it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know. What do you think?
МОНИКА: I think we should.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I do too.
МОНИКА: This is huge!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know.
МОНИКА: How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
МОНИКА: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
МОНИКА: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know. Goood luck with it.
РОСС: I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
ДЖОУИ: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
РОСС: I know, and with the baby coming?
ФИБИ: So, should we tell her?
РОСС: I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
ФИБИ: Why? Who’d you seen him with?
РОСС: No one, I’m just saying if.
ФИБИ: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
РОСС: I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
ФИБИ: All right. He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
РОСС: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I.
НЕДРУГ: WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, look at her, so happy!
МОНИКА: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, is uhm, is Chandler here?
МОНИКА: No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
ФИБИ: Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
НЕДРУГ: All right.
РОСС: We think Chandler might be having an affair.
МОНИКА: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
ФИБИ: They went in together. So sorry.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
МОНИКА: Yeah, sure, uhm, I'm devastated, obviously. Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: You son of a bitch!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
МОНИКА: Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and, em, they think you're having an affair.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Who's Nancy?
РОСС: What's going on?
МОНИКА: Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
ДЖОУИ: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!
ФИБИ: Why do you have a realtor?
МОНИКА: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
ДЖОУИ: What?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Are you serious?
МОНИКА: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
ФИБИ: So you're gonna move?
РОСС: Oh my God.
ДЖОУИ: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
МОНИКА: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
РОСС: So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
ФИБИ: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
РОСС: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
ДЖОУИ: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
РОСС: It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay, but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Actually, we already found a house we love.
РОСС: What?
МОНИКА: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
РОСС: You put an offer on a house?
МОНИКА: It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees.
ФИБИ: Wha? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
ДЖОУИ: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You know that's not the reason Joe.
МОНИКА: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah it is.
ДЖОУИ: What the hell are you doin'?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
ФИБИ: Yeah, but so is this.
РОСС: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a a purse, y'know? Or a or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha It's a metaphor, Daddy!
РОСС: You can see where he'd have trouble.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
МОНИКА: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica.
РОСС: That money is mine, Green!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You're fly is open, Geller!
ФИБИ: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey, that's.'joincidence' with a 'C'!
ФИБИ: Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow, that had to hurt!
ФИБИ: Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
НЕДРУГ: We will.
МОНИКА: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
МОНИКА: Every year.
ДЖОУИ: It's stuck!
ФИБИ: Easy. Step. How did it get on?
ДЖОУИ: I put it on to scare Chandler!
ФИБИ: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
ДЖОУИ: It smells really bad in here.
ФИБИ: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
МОНИКА: Hey, did you get the turkey bastOh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
ДЖОУИ: It's Joey.
МОНИКА: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oooohh that’s interesting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: If you win, we give up the birds.
ДЖОУИ: Dah!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But if we win, we get your apartment.
ДЖОУИ: Oooooh!
МОНИКА: Deal!
РОСС: What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
ДЖОУИ: Big fat goalie.
РОСС: Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Dangerous Liaisons.
РОСС: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is.
ДЖОУИ: Weekend at Bernie’s.
РОСС: Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
ДЖОУИ: Everyday use.

ЧЕНДЛЕР: Fancy guest.
РОСС: Two seconds.
ДЖОУИ: Uhh, 11!
РОСС: 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
РОСС: Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: 14?
РОСС: No, 19.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thanks man.
РОСС: Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?

РОСС: Correct, his profession was?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Space cowboy!
РОСС: Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow. Oh Gosh!
РОСС: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
МОНИКА: It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
МОНИКА: That’s not even a word!
МОНИКА: NOOOOOOOOO!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That is not true. She did! She forced me!
МОНИКА: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well it stupid, unfair question!
РОСС: Don’t blame the questions!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
РОСС: Chandler! Chandler! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
МОНИКА: Hey Ross. What's up bro?
РОСС: What the hell are doing?!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, what's-what's going on?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
ДЖОУИ: Dude! He's right there!
РОСС: I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! II cannot believe this!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
МОНИКА: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
РОСС: My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
МОНИКА: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, What were you thinking?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
ФИБИ: Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
НЕДРУГ: What?!
ФИБИ: You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
МОНИКА: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, III said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
ФИБИ: What else?
МОНИКА: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, I do. II do, do that.
ФИБИ: That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
МОНИКА: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
МОНИКА: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: She really left.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know.
МОНИКА: Thank you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No problem roomie.
МОНИКА: Can I ask you a question?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Sure!
МОНИКА: What the hell is that dog doing here?!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
НЕДРУГ: That's so sweet.
РОСС: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And a crappy New Year.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Here, here!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You can't move. You just, you just can't.
ДЖОУИ: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
ФИБИ: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
РОСС: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys, are just having dinner or, watching TV or something, but, it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and, maybe close your blinds at night.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
МОНИКА: And?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Okay, thanks. They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
МОНИКА: We can't afford that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know.
МОНИКА: Well, there you go.
ДЖОУИ: I'm really sorry you guys.
РОСС: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
ФИБИ: You're gonna be okay?
МОНИКА: Yeah, we'll be okay.
РОСС: Love you guys.
ДЖОУИ: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's okay, we understand.
ДЖОУИ: And about this Nancy thing. If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
МОНИКА: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so. I love that one so much.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
МОНИКА: What?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We got the house.
МОНИКА: Oh my God!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house!?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
МОНИКА: And a baby.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're growing up.
МОНИКА: We sure are.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So who's gonna tell them?
МОНИКА: Not it!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not it! Damn it!
МОНИКА: Rachel, this is yours.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Aah! Why? What are these for?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You'll see.
МОНИКА: All right, everybody open them!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
ФИБИ: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
МОНИКА: I know.
РОСС: I love this.
ДЖОУИ: A meatball Sub? Thanks!
РОСС: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but. We got the house.
МОНИКА: Enjoy!
