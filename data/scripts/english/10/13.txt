НЕДРУГ: Michelle
ФИБИ: Hi
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Hi!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: How was the honeymoon?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, where's Mike?
ФИБИ: Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
ДЖОУИ: Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
ФИБИ: Oh, why? What's up?
ДЖОУИ: I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
РОСС: Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
МОНИКА: Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
РОСС: It was ok...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I did not know you spoke French.
ФИБИ: Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh... you're so sexy!
ДЖОУИ: Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
ФИБИ: Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why are you wearing my apron?
МОНИКА: I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
РОСС: Hey.
МОНИКА: Hey.
РОСС: You guys know where Rachel is?
МОНИКА: No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
РОСС: So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
МОНИКА: Hey!
РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: These are for Erica!
РОСС: What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
МОНИКА: Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
РОСС: So, why is Erica coming to visit?
МОНИКА: Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
МОНИКА: Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
РОСС: Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross...
РОСС: No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney’s.
РОСС: Oh my God.
МОНИКА: Honey.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm so sorry...
РОСС: Is-is he ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
РОСС: Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
РОСС: Still-still, let me come... for me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. If you really need to.
РОСС: I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, I really could.
РОСС: Oh!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ohh...
ФИБИ: All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
ДЖОУИ: Je de coup Clow.
ФИБИ: Well, just... let's try it again.
ДЖОУИ: Ok.
ФИБИ: Je m'appelle Claude.
ДЖОУИ: Je depli mblue.
ФИБИ: Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
ДЖОУИ: Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
ФИБИ: It does, really?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah.
ФИБИ: All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
ДЖОУИ: Got it.
ФИБИ: Je m'appelle Claude.
ДЖОУИ: Je te flouppe Fli.
ФИБИ: Oh, mon Dieu!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, de fuff!
МОНИКА: Hey you guys.
ФИБИ: Hi!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
МОНИКА: I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
ФИБИ: Oh!
МОНИКА: Joey. Erica, baby!
ДЖОУИ: Hi.
МОНИКА: Everyone. Erica, baby!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Monica. Calm, self.
НЕДРУГ: Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
ДЖОУИ: Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would you say that?
ФИБИ: Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
НЕДРУГ: I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
ДЖОУИ: Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah, let's do that!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
РОСС: And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Can somebody please go in?
НЕДРУГ: Absolutely.
РОСС: Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
РОСС: I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
НЕДРУГ: He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
РОСС: I'm feeling better.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
НЕДРУГ: Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
РОСС: He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
НЕДРУГ: Ok.
РОСС: Did the TV wake you?
НЕДРУГ: No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
РОСС: Ouchy.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing here, Geller?
РОСС: Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
РОСС: Right, is it painful?
НЕДРУГ: What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
НЕДРУГ: So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
РОСС: Nope, just the one. RACH!
ФИБИ: Je m'appelle Claude.
ДЖОУИ: Je do call blue!
ФИБИ: Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
ДЖОУИ: je.
ФИБИ: m'ap
ДЖОУИ: mah
ФИБИ: pelle
ДЖОУИ: pel.
ФИБИ: Great, ok faster! "je"
ДЖОУИ: je.
ФИБИ: m'ap
ДЖОУИ: mah
ФИБИ: pelle
ДЖОУИ: pel.
ФИБИ: Je m'appelle!
ДЖОУИ: Me pooh pooh!
ФИБИ: Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
ДЖОУИ: What are you doing?
ФИБИ: I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
ДЖОУИ: Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh. Did you call your parents?
РОСС: Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh good.
РОСС: Wow.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
РОСС: Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
РОСС: Sorry. . You ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah.
РОСС: You had a rough day, uh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
РОСС: But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
РОСС: What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
РОСС: No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok, maybe you're right.
РОСС: Good night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
РОСС: Sure!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
РОСС: Oh, of course...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
РОСС: Me too. Come here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I just don't want to be alone tonight.
РОСС: Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
РОСС: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
РОСС: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Wow. Ok.
РОСС: I'll see you in the morning .
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Mhm-mh!
РОСС: Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
НЕДРУГ: Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
МОНИКА: Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: New York is awesome!
МОНИКА: What is with you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
МОНИКА: Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
НЕДРУГ: Thanks so much for showing me around.
МОНИКА: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
НЕДРУГ: Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's great.
НЕДРУГ: Yeah... it's almost definitely him.
МОНИКА: How's that now?
НЕДРУГ: Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
НЕДРУГ: No, he's in prison.
МОНИКА: Was he falsely accused of something?
НЕДРУГ: No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
МОНИКА: Are you awake?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
МОНИКА: Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
МОНИКА: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
МОНИКА: How?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
МОНИКА: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
НЕДРУГ: We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
ДЖОУИ: Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
НЕДРУГ: Good job.
ДЖОУИ: Thank you.
ФИБИ: Hey Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Hey!
ФИБИ: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
ДЖОУИ: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
ФИБИ: Really, can I hear some of it.
ДЖОУИ: Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
ФИБИ: Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
ДЖОУИ: Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
ФИБИ: How could you possibly think that?
ДЖОУИ: For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
РОСС: Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Sure.
РОСС: You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hmm-hmm.
РОСС: You sure you're alright?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yep.
РОСС: O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: FYI..
РОСС: There it is...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
РОСС: Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
РОСС: Well...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh stop that!
РОСС: I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
РОСС: Hey, I was looking out for you.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
РОСС: I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
РОСС: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: What?
РОСС: That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey! How was lunch?
НЕДРУГ: We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, really?
НЕДРУГ: No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
МОНИКА: Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
МОНИКА: No it's not.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: How do you know?
НЕДРУГ: Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
МОНИКА: The thing we never do.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Shovely Joe!
НЕДРУГ: Whenever you're ready Joey.
ДЖОУИ: Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
НЕДРУГ: I'm sorry, what's going on?
ДЖОУИ: Dude, come on! French it u-up!
НЕДРУГ: Joey, do you speak French?
ДЖОУИ: Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
НЕДРУГ: You know what. I think this audition is over.
ФИБИ: Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
НЕДРУГ: You really think this man is speaking French?
ДЖОУИ: Sa-sa-saw!
ФИБИ: Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé.
ФИБИ: Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...
НЕДРУГ: Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
ДЖОУИ: Ah. All right. But my French was good?
НЕДРУГ: It was great.
ДЖОУИ: Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
ФИБИ: Merci. Au revoir.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
РОСС: Emma's down for the night.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, good.
РОСС: So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
РОСС: Oh, no problem.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
РОСС: Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
РОСС: Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
РОСС: Oh, ye-ah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
РОСС: ...Valentine's day...
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
РОСС: Hmmm-mmmm.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Not even one more time?
РОСС: Not even once.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No matter how much we want it.
РОСС: Even if we want it really bad.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: That's what we decided.
РОСС: Uhm, right!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...It's kinda hard though!
РОСС: Yeah.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
РОСС: ...I hate waste.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: ...Ross?
РОСС: Yes?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
РОСС: Damn it. It's never off the table.
ФИБИ: Okay, can you really tapdance?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ФИБИ: It's off the resumé.
ФИБИ: Archery?
ДЖОУИ: No.
ФИБИ: Horseback riding?
ДЖОУИ: Would fall off a lot.
ФИБИ: You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
ДЖОУИ: That I can do.
ФИБИ: Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
ДЖОУИ: All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
ФИБИ: Ready... GO!
ФИБИ: You did it!
