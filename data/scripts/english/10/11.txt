ЧЕНДЛЕР: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.

НЕДРУГ: I'd love to!
РОСС: Great!
НЕДРУГ: So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
РОСС: Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
НЕДРУГ: Sure, he was in your band?
РОСС: It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
НЕДРУГ: Sorry.
РОСС: That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
НЕДРУГ: Really?
РОСС: Yeah, why?
НЕДРУГ: Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
РОСС: You did?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!

РЕЙЧЕЛ: Uh! The police!
ФИБИ: Oh!
НЕДРУГ: That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
МОНИКА: What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
НЕДРУГ: Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
НЕДРУГ: Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
МОНИКА: Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,
НЕДРУГ: Goodbody!
МОНИКА: If-you-say-so.
НЕДРУГ: So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
ФИБИ: Oh, God!
НЕДРУГ: All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! Whaaaa. Here? All right.
ФИБИ: Rachel?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah?
ФИБИ: Are you kidding?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
ФИБИ: How old is your phonebook?
МОНИКА: Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
ФИБИ: Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
НЕДРУГ: Are you talking about me?
МОНИКА: Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
НЕДРУГ: Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? Did someone call for the long arm of the law? I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
НЕДРУГ: Whoa, whoa, whoa. She cringed!
ФИБИ: This is how I look when I'm turned on!
НЕДРУГ: You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
ФИБИ: Shocking!
НЕДРУГ: Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
ФИБИ: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
ФИБИ: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
НЕДРУГ: Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed. I dunno, like a billion stairs. It's not like I can take them two at a time!
ФИБИ: I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
НЕДРУГ: Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
ФИБИ: Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
НЕДРУГ: I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath, is all man.
ФИБИ: I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, you're mean!
МОНИКА: Uh, look, officer, uhm Sir.
НЕДРУГ: Damnit. OH! Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
НЕДРУГ: Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.
ДЖОУИ: My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
НЕДРУГ: Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, uh, uh, pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
НЕДРУГ: Uvula!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, then pass.
НЕДРУГ: O-kay. Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.
РОСС: You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Excuse me. That didn't make us sound gay at all!
РОСС: You broke the pact!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ross, that was 16 years ago!
РОСС: That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
РОСС: I didn't.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh really?
РОСС: No.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh really!?
РОСС: NO!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: ADRIENNE TURNER!
НЕДРУГ: Yes?
НЕДРУГ: Hey! Hey Adrienne.
РОСС: I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
РОСС: I don't know what, you're talking about.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
МОНИКА: I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
МОНИКА: Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
МОНИКА: Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: It. You can so totally tell.
МОНИКА: I KNOW!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Aren't you?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Right. So how're you doing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Bitchin'
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hi Monica.
МОНИКА: Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
МОНИКА: Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh.
МОНИКА: Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
РОСС: Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
НЕДРУГ: Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
РОСС: Cool!
РОСС: I didn't know you knew about that.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: Betrayal In The Common Room.
РОСС: Man. I. I'm sorry.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
РОСС: So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hmm mmmhm.
РОСС: We are even, right?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
РОСС: What did you do to my mom?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Not her!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am sooo drunk.
МОНИКА: That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Soo, you girls having fun?
МОНИКА: For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
НЕДРУГ: SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
МОНИКА: Oh THATS ME!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, what a line.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So where are you applying to?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of. Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm in college and I'm in a band.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah okay.
НЕДРУГ: What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
ФИБИ: You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
НЕДРУГ: No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
НЕДРУГ: I don't know. I can make my pecs dance. I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks. I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: So maybe something in an office.
ФИБИ: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
НЕДРУГ: You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
ФИБИ: There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
ФИБИ: Finish it!
НЕДРУГ: What?
ФИБИ: Your last dance. Do it for us.
НЕДРУГ: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Really?
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
НЕДРУГ: Okay, all right. Get ready ladies!
ФИБИ: Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
ФИБИ: Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
НЕДРУГ: Have to.
НЕДРУГ: Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?

НЕДРУГ: A torch, a bonfire, uhm, your pee.
ДЖОУИ: Things that burn.

МОНИКА: She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
РОСС: Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
МОНИКА: What? When was this?
РОСС: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
МОНИКА: Oh my God! That's wild!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
РОСС: Well, it matters to me.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why?
РОСС: Because, the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You kissed her that night too?
МОНИКА: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Seriously, where did this happen?
РОСС: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but, it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh wait. What bed did you say she was on?
РОСС: Mine.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
РОСС: No, she was definitely on my bed.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
РОСС: Well, then who was on my bed?
МОНИКА: OH! Oh, oh!
РОСС: NO! No, no!
МОНИКА: YES!
РОСС: You were under the pile of coats?
МОНИКА: I was the pile of coats!
РОСС: OH MY GOD!
МОНИКА: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
РОСС: You were my first kiss with Rachel?
МОНИКА: You were my first kiss ever?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: What did I marry into?
