РОСС: Hey!
МОНИКА: Hey!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
ФИБИ: Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
МОНИКА: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
ДЖОУИ: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: And so incorrect!
МОНИКА: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
РОСС: Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
МОНИКА: And a lot could still get in our way.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
ФИБИ: What are you gonna name the baby?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
ДЖОУИ: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
МОНИКА: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
МОНИКА: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yes, but...
МОНИКА: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hey, who's Phoebe with?
ДЖОУИ: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
ФИБИ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: So... who's your friend?
ФИБИ: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
ДЖОУИ: OW, why, why, why?
ФИБИ: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
ФИБИ: Mandy.
ДЖОУИ: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
ФИБИ: No.
ДЖОУИ: I know why I don't remember her, huh?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Do you think I'm someone else?
ДЖОУИ: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
ДЖОУИ: Growth!
ФИБИ: Fine, I'll give you her number.
ДЖОУИ: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
ФИБИ: SARAH!
ДЖОУИ: Saraaah.
РОСС: Hey!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi!
РОСС: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh!
РОСС: How does this look?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
РОСС: C'mon! This looks good!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
РОСС: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
ФИБИ: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
РОСС: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
ДЖОУИ: I can see why, nice shirt!
РОСС: You're wearing the same shirt.
ДЖОУИ: Stupid Gap on every corner!
НЕДРУГ: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
МОНИКА: Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
МОНИКА: Uh, we're gonna be great.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're gonna be great.
МОНИКА: Well... obviously!
НЕДРУГ: Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
МОНИКА: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
НЕДРУГ: Hi...
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
НЕДРУГ: Hi.
НЕДРУГ: I'll let you get acquainted.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Ok.
НЕДРУГ: So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: That's what our friends call us.
НЕДРУГ: Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
МОНИКА: I don't know about that.
НЕДРУГ: You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I don't think that's exactly...
МОНИКА: Let her finish, doctor.
НЕДРУГ: Hey!
ДЖОУИ: Hey.
ФИБИ: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
ДЖОУИ: Well...
ФИБИ: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
ДЖОУИ: Nope.
ФИБИ: What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
ФИБИ: That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
ФИБИ: What?
ДЖОУИ: ALL FOOD!
ФИБИ: I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
ДЖОУИ: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
ФИБИ: Oh
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Hi
ФИБИ: Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: what?
ФИБИ: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Oh, no!
ФИБИ: What? You know about the plate thing?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
ФИБИ: You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! Not me! Emma!
ДЖОУИ: JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
ФИБИ: Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
ДЖОУИ: I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
НЕДРУГ: This place is awesome!
РОСС: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ah, this place is great!
ФИБИ: Wow!
РОСС: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
РОСС: Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
РОСС: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
НЕДРУГ: Hey, check this out! It’s totally you!
РОСС: Wow!
ФИБИ: Yeah!
РОСС: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
ФИБИ: What? They will be!
РОСС: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
РОСС: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
РОСС: Really?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
РОСС: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Why do men keep talking to me like this?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”
МОНИКА: Amen.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
МОНИКА: Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
НЕДРУГ: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
МОНИКА: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
НЕДРУГ: Wow.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, wow.
НЕДРУГ: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
МОНИКА: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
НЕДРУГ: Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: No-ot for me it doesn’t.
НЕДРУГ: So, how’s everything going in here?
НЕДРУГ: We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
НЕДРУГ: Do you have any question for Erica?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
НЕДРУГ: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
НЕДРУГ: Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
НЕДРУГ: Actually, I don’t think we have to.
МОНИКА: We don’t?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
МОНИКА: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Yeah, I did.
МОНИКА: Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
НЕДРУГ: We got some really great stuff!
ФИБИ: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
ФИБИ: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
РЕЙЧЕЛ: Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
ФИБИ: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
РОСС: So? What do you think?
ДЖОУИ: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
РОСС: Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
ДЖОУИ: Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
РОСС: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
ДЖОУИ: Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
РОСС: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: We are NOT signing those papers.
МОНИКА: Why not?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
МОНИКА: God works in mysterious ways.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have gotta stop!
МОНИКА: But she liked us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
МОНИКА: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
МОНИКА: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
МОНИКА: Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I know..
МОНИКА: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: oh, honey..
МОНИКА: Please.. please, we are so close.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
МОНИКА: Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You're Jewish.
МОНИКА: Technicality!
НЕДРУГ: A garden salad for the lady
ДЖОУИ: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
НЕДРУГ: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
НЕДРУГ: Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
ДЖОУИ: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
НЕДРУГ: Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
ДЖОУИ: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
ДЖОУИ: How about those fries though, huh?
НЕДРУГ: They are delicious
ДЖОУИ: You are beautiful, you know that?
НЕДРУГ: Oh, that is so sweet..
ДЖОУИ: Oh okay..
ДЖОУИ: NOW look what you did!!
НЕДРУГ: What? what is the matter with you?
ДЖОУИ: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
НЕДРУГ: But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
ДЖОУИ: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
НЕДРУГ: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
ДЖОУИ: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do .
НЕДРУГ: Wow, this place looks great.
РОСС: Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
НЕДРУГ: Me too!
РОСС: Here So this was fun!
ДЖОУИ: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
НЕДРУГ: Sure Just not as much as clams.
ДЖОУИ: Well, stuffed clams.
НЕДРУГ: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
ДЖОУИ: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
НЕДРУГ: Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
ДЖОУИ: So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
НЕДРУГ: Oh my God!
ДЖОУИ: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
НЕДРУГ: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
НЕДРУГ: Mmmm! Mmm!
НЕДРУГ: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
ДЖОУИ: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
НЕДРУГ: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
ДЖОУИ: Sure I do. Coule?
НЕДРУГ: No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
ДЖОУИ: Really?
НЕДРУГ: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
ДЖОУИ: Stop staring at me!
ДЖОУИ: Why, just a tiny little...
ДЖОУИ: Oh-oh!
ДЖОУИ: I'm not even sorry.
НЕДРУГ: Hi!
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Hey.
НЕДРУГ: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
МОНИКА: I-Is... Is that a picture?
НЕДРУГ: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
МОНИКА: Look, doctor!
НЕДРУГ: I don't understand.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
НЕДРУГ: What?
НЕДРУГ: That's impossible.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
НЕДРУГ: I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
НЕДРУГ: So who are you?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
МОНИКА: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
НЕДРУГ: So you lied to me before?
МОНИКА: Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
НЕДРУГ: I can't believe this.
МОНИКА: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
НЕДРУГ: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
МОНИКА: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
НЕДРУГ: I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Erica wait!
НЕДРУГ: I've nothing to say to you.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
НЕДРУГ: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
НЕДРУГ: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.
ЧЕНДЛЕР: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
ЧЕНДЛЕР: You still want that baby?
МОНИКА: God bless you Chandler Bing!
РОСС: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
ДЖОУИ: So, why are you still wearing it?
РОСС: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
ДЖОУИ: Ooh... Not so good.
РОСС: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
ДЖОУИ: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
ДЖОУИ: JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
