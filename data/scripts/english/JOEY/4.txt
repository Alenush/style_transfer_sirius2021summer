Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler... ...and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either. Oh-oh! And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don't know what happened there either... Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it? Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole! Oh no! No!! My hole!! What?! What?!! What is it?! Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole. Well, there's really only one thing you can do. You're gonna have to pee on it. Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel. If you want some privacy you can use my hole. Me too. No? Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about. It's between us and the sea, Ross! Nope. All right. Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish. And I was tired from digging the huge hole! I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel... That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler. That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out. How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide. Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands! All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them. Looks good, uh? Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks! What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant. Oh. What do you do? What? What's wrong? Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni... Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out. Pretty nice? Good for you!! Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!! Uh, Pheebs, about your mom... How's that going? That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee. This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man. Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin. Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit. Okay. See?! I told ya! Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!! WHAT?!! Yeah... Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!! Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man! I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do? Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is! Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!! Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. Huh?! Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! Just pickle. Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant. Uhhhh. No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there. Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in. He cut off his ear. I’m out. Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there? In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer. Spock’s birth control. Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. In a minute. Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’. How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time? You wanna see what I got? Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey! And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants. Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out. Wh-what’s going on? No he doesn’t! Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius. Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation. Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant. Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War? Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry? I`m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson. All right that`s it, school is in session! Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you`re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord. Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry. I have actually not heard of that. Why don`t you tell me something I don`t know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey mouths "Oops!" Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he`d better come up here and apologize. I`ll see you later. He said that he wasn`t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he`s gonna do is have you evicted! I`ll see you later. Well he made Rachel cry! All right! I`ll try! But if I can`t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled. All right, all right, all right. I mean I`ll have to check with him first, but I`ll think he`ll be cool with it. Please don`t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn`t their fault, it was mine. No you can`t do that, where would the chick and the duck live? Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I`m the chick and Chandler is the duck. Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I`ll do whatever you want. Yeah-yeah, absolutely. What, what is it? That`s not, prison lingo, is it? Yeah, there`s this superintendent`s dance, the Super Ball. I don`t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he has a crush on. Well, he`s too shy, he doesn`t think he`s good enough to dance with girls yet. Aww, man, now we won`t be bank buddies! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I`m doing something exciting and I don`t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y`know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler! No-no, thank you. All right, I`m here, let`s ahh, get this over with. Whoa-whoa, don`t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk? No, it`s okay, but if I`m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back. Come on man, you`re not a potato. Come on Treeger, don`t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let`s ahh, let`s try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y`know, I`m not really that comfortable dancing with a... We-he!! Hey! Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. What? No I didn`t. No, I`m not! And it wasn`t a hop it was a pademarie. All right, well maybe I`m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I`m getting pretty good at it. Hey-hey, hold on, this isn`t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it`s like a sport, it`s manly! All right. I don`t know how to lead. What?! So you ah, ready for our last practice? Look, you wanna use our place? We did it!! I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful. Oh well, okay, good luck. Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango? Okay. Go get `em Treeger. Really? No, I`m good. Hey! Hey, I see you guys already met, huh? Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off. Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters. Hey. Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet. Hey! Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight? It's 4:30. Okay, I see what's going on here. Yeah! You don't like Kathy. Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right? Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right? Is she great or what? I'll be right back. What was that? Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal. I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend. Well then, do it better! Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little. Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind? Hey! Why? You can pee here! We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something? Oh, I know... Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? Why not? Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I... Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it. So, you just left? Her place was really that bad? Yeah. Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. What kind of smell? All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? You wanna see her again, right? So you're gonna have to do it in the mess! Yeah. Yeah! All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink! Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you! Our place, the hall! I... A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe? You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? Wow. That's almost as much as a new book. Hey! Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now. Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! Hey! You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too. Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho! Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed? Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. . Hey, that coupon expires, you know. Great! All right, so I`ll call you later. That would be Casey. We`re going out tonight. No, things are fine with Kathy. I`m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? What is the big deal? It`s not like we`re exclusive. You got all that from the back of her head? Who`s Elaine? Hey, it`s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble. We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I`ll be there as soon as I can. `Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to.... Yeah? Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more... Hey dude, it`s me. Listen uh, I`m really sorry, it looks like I`m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn`t there! Yeah, it must`ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog. Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. Aww man! I can`t believe I locked myself out again! Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this? Why? Well, you`re amazing. A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That`s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I`m gonna do that. No-no-no, I think I`m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She`s pretty cool. No-no, Kathy. No. No, Kathy. Y`know what I think? I think somebody`s got a little crush on Casey. How `bout I fix you two up? What do you think? Hey! Samboucha Margarita? Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now. What`s up? You do? Well, you`re timing couldn`t be better. She`s not my girlfriend anymore. Yeah, she broke up with me. Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that`s why I let people watch. Well, I`ve been better. But, I`m all right. So you like her huh? No-no-no, no it`s uh, it`s okay. Yeah. You know why? `Cause you can to me first. But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you`re work cut out for you. `Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she`s into some other guy. So... Who? What? And what?! Did you sleep with her?! What?!! That`s even worse!! I don`t know! But it`s the same! Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you! Over the line?! You-you`re-you`re so far past the line, that you-you can`t even see the line! The line is a dot to you! Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y`know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there`s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I`m not gonna eat! You know why?! Because it`s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I`m not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. Hello. Hello. Stop callin'!! All right! Hey! I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. No! I'm putting that in my room. Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? Five years. Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. Yeah! What? All right. But if you weren't my best friend. Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?  My folks. I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment. Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I... Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya. Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving. When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down! Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around! We've got a box. What's twisted? Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew! He's fine! Chandler? Hey! He's doin' some thinkin'! You kissed my girlfriend! That doesn't sound like thinking to me! Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes! All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box! So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously? That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay. I'll get it. Hey. That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at. In the box. Open the box!! He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there! Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out! Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there. Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa! All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade. Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police. I think I know that girl. Oh yeah, I definitely know her. Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book? Well, why do you call him Gandolf? No, I had sex in high school. Will you calm down, he's just a human guy. Really?! All right, I'll see you guys. I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon? Okay. Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf. So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'? So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves! Well, we could do that! We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on! Yeah! Yeah!! Yeah! All right? Let's go! All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out. So, we're having fun, right? We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing. Are you serious?! Thank God! I'm exhausted! Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf. I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad. Yeah, I know. Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends. We're 29, we're not women. Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now? Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas. Ohhh! Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me? Good enough to get fired. Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials? What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole. Sure! Where are the seats? Now, wait a second! You make food and robots? Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that! Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? Hey! Damn! Hey. Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket? You got it! Oh-oh! It's still a tiny bit on fire there. Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname. There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one! No ma'am. I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!" And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you. Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in. Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it! You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all. What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller! Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year. Lean-lean-lean! Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me. No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. "And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period." Yeah, but I can pronounce "Jurassic". You're really thinking of having sex with your brother? Oh. Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy. Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period. Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. Okay, now right down here we have, uh... a large foot. Okay, moving right along. Come on. Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross. Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname. Well, uh, how come? That's crazy. I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it. Ross, Ross, over here man. I saved you a seat. It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right? Whatever. Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. I will sit with you Dr. Geller. I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs. You hang in there Ted! It's the chick! She's going through some changes. Good luck. And I'm still right! She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants. Yeah, what's that about? Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag? Six. All right, we'll start with apples. Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt. Okay, the last thing. No-no, not for like another two weeks. Serious? No! All right, who-who makes up the questions? Huh. I know. Animals dressed as humans. The Irish gig guy?! It's All Relative. Nana? Althea! I took a shot. Hey, no way, that rooster's family! What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise! Look, we are not gonna... Dah!! Oooooh! Okay. Big fat goalie. Weekend at Bernie's. Everyday use. Guest. Uhh, 11! I call Monica's room! Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it. What? Hey, ooh Pheebs, are they in there? Oh wow! You can tell this soon. What?! You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet! Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes! But it is our apartment! Did you see the size of the closets?! Hey! There's gravy? I think I left a donut up here. Hey! That-that is a good trick. Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot? Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble. Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage? Noooo!! Hey Mon! Want some pancakes? Yep! Grab a plate. No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer. Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over. Oh yeah, who's playing? All right Pheebs, stick out your plate! I don't know, it smells good. Wow! The new Playboy! Come here. Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on! Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on. Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?" Hey, how you doin'? Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes! Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket? What the heck is that? No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that! Dude, tell me she actually told you this. Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry. Okay, for next time, what do you say? What's ready? I don't know, it looks the same. Oh yeah! How'd it go? Guggly worm. Glow-pop giggly jammer. Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?" Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two. Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club. Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women. Yeah. Hey-hey! Oh my God, you guys have no idea. Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing? Hey buddy! How's it going? Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah! Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here! Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it. Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here! Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip! Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad? Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is? No-no, it's uh, it's Heston. Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice. Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be? Interesting. How ya doin'? I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh? No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink. Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause your a loose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink! Yeah. Oh no-no-no, you don't understand! Oh yeah, yeah. Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm, Yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't wanna. I wanted to go to the strip club! Yeah, all right. Ohh, Nothing. I know what it did! Nothing. Like this. Sure! It flushes it. Hey! Ah!! And there it is. So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here! Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya! Hey! What's up? I bet I stopped listening before you did. Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport. Hey-hey, what's going on? Thanks for telling me! Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country. Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is! Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle. Ross! They're gonna kill you! All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's Chandler! Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one Dude! They're all huge! Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are. I totally don't know what you're talking about. No. Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross! The Red Ross! Okay. Yeah, sure. Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice. Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great! Hey! Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk? Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they’re hanging out with Joey." Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there. What do ya say? What do ya say? I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid! Hey! No, but I’m gonna! Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler. Someone you didn’t make up! Yeah, that guy really hurt us. All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name! I’m sorry man, I didn’t, I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. So I guess it’s Joey then! Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. Dude, I am sorry about what I said! It’s not that bad. So, you’re just Bing? No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint. See you later, Gene. What’s up with Gene? Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney. Ohh! Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning’s here! Morning is here..... See, this is a great apartment. Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants. You have Knicks tickets? Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor! Yeah! You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought. Yeah, you do! Come on! Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means? Oh come on, look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that! Hey! We don’t make enough fun of you already? Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear. What? All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her! No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast! Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight! It’s the Knicks! Whoa! Huh. Yeah, the Knicks rule all! Done! Oh. Ooh, we could end up with nothing. Ooh, I like that. Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend. All right! Okay! What’s the game?! What’s the game?! Uhh, they’re tall. Oh. Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can’t. Okay. Okay. Ace! What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace! Okay. Uh-huh, not as high as, It worked! King! Why?! Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back! Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering. Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!! I don’t know. I don’t want to move again! That was one good minute! Good night. Ross has some big thing to tell everyone. Yeah! Yeah! Monica and Rachel made out. Hey! Get into gear! Okay! Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!! Oh, you should here me. Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic! Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class! Ohhh, yeah! I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it. That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh! You can’t do anything! This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired! Yeah, well.... Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well. I am, free! Hey! That’s the day after I stop menstruating! This isn’t mine. Joey Tribbiani. Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin’? What?! So why don’t you give me your number? Hey you guys! What’s happening? Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore. I know I don’t have too! It tastes good. Dude! I am trying to sleep! I know. Ross is getting married. Everybody’s doing stuff! We could climb Mt. Everest! No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that! Yeah! Hey! We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest! We could get that Everest video though. And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we are! It's never gonna happen. Don’t answer that. Awful! Horrible! She was nothing compared to you. Ewwwww! Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation." Hey! Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him. I knew that! I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces. Heyyy. He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. Lookin' good Mr. Cotter. It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear! I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside! Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
