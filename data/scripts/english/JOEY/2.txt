Um, this? Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie. Needs some clothes altered? Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990? You know, I think I was sixteen. No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again. Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe? Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means. Can we see her? How're you doing? Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts. You gotta tell Ross how you feel. What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. Frankie? What're you talking about? No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years. That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? What? That's not? Oh my god. Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants. I gotta get one, too. Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. Uh, does it hurt? Chandler? Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle. Who? What's he doin' in my section? Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'? Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory. Yeah. Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee. Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? What is the big deal? Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh- Exactly. Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Yeah I guess you're right. I'm gonna do it. Mornin'. I said, mornin'. Yeah, I'm ready. These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts. You guys are messin' with me, right? That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa." "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!" Such as? Check this out. Can I have this? Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too. Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook. "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school. That's what it says. What? So, you were both dorks. Big deal. Have you been here all night? Chandler, Heckles was a nut case. All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go. Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody. I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out. Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place? You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right? Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably. Geez, look how fat she got. Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you? You want his yearbook? Oh, yeah. This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married? I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it. What happens if you flick it? Foxy lady. The Ice Capades? I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray. Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . . Me too, we should get goin'. I got time. Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? Do we need a cake? All right. Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies. Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there. For Ross. Hi. If it's not you, this is a horrible story. Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney? Cool. Sorry, sorry. What are these, like famous chickens? Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper? Thank you. Yeah. Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you. 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. Yeah. Thanks. Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like-- Charity. Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel. Me too. Fine. Come on you guys, one more time. Nooo. Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid. You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish? And we don't work hard? And you feel like we hold you back. Let me get that. You got five bucks? Cool. Goo, goo, goo, waaah! Are you ok, Ross? Is he gonna be ok? What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we? Hat, milk, got it. Consider it done. Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue. It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby. No, seriously. You wanna smell him? Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Hey, hey, look at that talent. Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff. Yeah. Get outta here. This is our stop too. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk. Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink? Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again. I'm him. Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks. Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth. Yeah. Ahh! Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. You got a better idea? Heads. Yes! Whew! Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. Yes! There's still pie. Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today. The guy still won't put out, huh? Maybe he, uhh, drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean. Maybe he's. . . gay. Woah, woah, woah, you have a date? But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . . You're getting a cat? What? Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack." Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him. Hey Phoebs. I can't find the remote. Thank you. And? All right Phoebs, way to go. So, so how did it happen? And what did he say? Wow. Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. This man is my God. Tongue? Cool. Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked? No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... You got all that from saline solution? Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses. Hey, here's a thought, Ross. Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first. You could say that. Oh, her ankles are a little chubby. Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart? He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her? Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea. Hey, Ross! What are you doin'? Oh, yeah, I do. I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer. It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.. Are you really not going? Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!" I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer? They didn't fight a lot? Hey, look who's up. I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly. How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got. No, my first fan mail. Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner? Ah, the stalker. Let's get out of here. OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met. She's comin'. Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready? Erica. Yeah it is. . . what? Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. No one. Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that. Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something. But that's what...

Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up? Who? It's not what you think, that was... Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor. Somebody wanna help me out here? 'Cause it's a television show. I'm not Drake. Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you. Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care OK, alright, the people who threw the water. This is amazing. I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies. Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. Woah, dude, burn. Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he? Gotcha.

The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax. Hi. What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel? She laughed at you? It certainly is a miracle. No, inside good, outside bad. Naa, she's lyin'. Is that the fire alarm? Cool. Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat? What? Yeah, so. Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain. Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. Hey. Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch. Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get? So where you gettin' it? Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two? Can you believe this place? Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes. Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man. Huh? Yeah, can you see me in a place like this? Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment. Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love. Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it. I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore. What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie. Well that's how I feel. Well then maybe I will. Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons. Hey. Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . . I know. Yeah. No, we're alright. Plastic spoons. Great. These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones. Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment. I'm movin' out like we talked about. Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever. Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry. Woah. Why do you get to keep the table? Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half. Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass. Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister? Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it. Yes! And the table is mine. Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right? Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street. Naa, you keep it, you need the practice. So, I guess this is it. Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again. Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care. Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself. Art. Thanks, yeah.

Was that the oven timer? Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer? Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe. Hey, hey, they're runnin' I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think. You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad. Hey. You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes? Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet? Wow. Oh, now it's a spare room? Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys. Yeah, yeah he is. Eddie. Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail? You don't keep it over here on this table any more? Huh. No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me. So how you two gettin' along? Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice for the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice. Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man. Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh? Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which. It may not be a bed of roses. Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over. Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question. No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket. Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick? I don't know. How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car? Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar. Hey. Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car. Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats . No problem. Hey Chandler Ok. He-he-eyy. Ok. He kept my dollar. How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him. Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game. We're the guys. Man you are incredible. Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with. No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here. Oh yeah. Nooooo. Not a dad. Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel? Freaky. Monica, relax, go get a beer. Who said it was for you? You're kiddin'. Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back. Do what? See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea? Yeah good luck, good luck. Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich? Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo. Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone? Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline. Hey, hey, hey no. Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will. Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh. Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go. Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home? Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now. Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.' Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50. How come those? That is so not my motto. Good. Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it. It's a woman. Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. Hard to say. Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there. Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? By someone besides Monica? He-he-he, how's it goin'? Excellent. Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper. Cause she uh, she steals stuff. Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared. I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok. Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals. Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo. Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed. Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room. Right this is staging. This is clearly in the wrong apartment. Quick volleyball question. Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you? Ahh, you drive safe. Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care. Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection. Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? Oh no, what happened? Yeah, I've had it. But don't you need experience for a job like that? Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call. Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks? Hey. Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie. Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh? I figure my character has kids. Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does. Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did. You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it. Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie. What a phony. Sir. Yeah Bing, what's that about? This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas. Joseph's good, isn't he? Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say. Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you. 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department. Karen. Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. Really? Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else. It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was. All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy. No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. I did do it, I'm a professional. See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me. Come on, I need your help here. You see this, this is a friend. Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem? Yeah, that makes sense. Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone. Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon . Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on? Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men. Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh . Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
