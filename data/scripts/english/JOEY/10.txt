Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
No idea what it means.
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Is he gone?
Pssst...
Well, he's with Charlie now.
You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
I like although!
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
I'm thinking about you...
Let's forget about Ross...
What's wrong?
Well, maybe I can help.
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
I understand...
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Ooh...
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Hey!
Yeah?
You kissed.
I saw you.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
Yeah... Now I have something...
Oh... uh... look... before you...
I am those things, yeah.
Dude!
I can't think of anything.
Yeah.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Hey!
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
Yeah! Good night!
Good night!
Stop saying good night.
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
Rach, he just saw us.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
Yeah, but it did happen, so...
Ross?
No, no, no!
Probably.
No, no!
Really?
Ross..
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
I do like fajitas.
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
In a carriage!
Hey, Charlie!
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Oh. Oh, thanks.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
Uh, actually, that's..
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Dude, are you okay?
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
It doesn't look good, does it?
Morning. Here you go.
Yeah.
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
That's what I hear, yeah.
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
I'm crazy about her.
I think so.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
And we're okay?
Yeah. It's actually our first official date
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
It's OK!
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
More foosball?
I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
Yeah.
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
What’s the matter?
I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
Ok.
Uh, was that good for you?
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Ok, yeah, got it.
This thing welded shut?!
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
Sorry!
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
NAH! I don't have another level!!
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Hey!
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Uh!
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Oh! yeah!
uh uh!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
Soldier down!
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
I don't know.
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
That's a... pla-an.
Wow... I did not see this coming.
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
So...
I love ya.
Yeah, me too.
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Come on robot!
Way to go robot!
Hey, good race you guys.
Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
I've been here the whole time!
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
Hey!
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
That's right, yeah.
Always nice to meet a fan!
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
What did I just say?
Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
Yep!
Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Why not?
Ah, look who’s back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
What?
You slept out here?
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
Yeah, Monica made us!
Yeaah.
I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Yeah.
No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
Whoo-hoo!
She has a lot of crap!
Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
Hi sweetie!
No.
Cool!
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
I'm cold!
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Thank you.
Damn it!
Just pass it to your boss!
What's up?
Oh.
But, ehm... you watched the tape?
You didn't watch the tape.
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Well, you lied again!
Keep going Pinocchio!
No you didn't!
You still here?
Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
What?
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
But it's an original Buffay...
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
Now, what do you say?
And?... AND?
Gladys?
You're mean!
Hey!
What's going on?
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Celebrity.
Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Guys!?
What's going on?
Everything doesn't sound fine!
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
I did not care for that!
Ok, ok!
I forgot my bat.
Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...
LAURA!
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Oh.
Yeah, they're great seats too!
Center ice.
So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
Dude, two times that happened!
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
Yeah!
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
I know, yeah.
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
I don't know...
Okay.
How late are we?
Wow
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
You are not at Thanksgiving?
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
Yeah, where were you!
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
No. Here
Who do you think its from?
I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Ah-haah! I win!!
That's fire. Beats everything.
Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
WATER BALLOON!
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Don't make me come up there!
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Sorry!
Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
Ha!
Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Oh, that smells good!
Okay.
It isn't working.
Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Interesting...
I left them at the park.
It's really starting to hurt.
Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Yeah! Come on!
Man, I've got food all over me.
I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
So... who's your friend?
OW, why, why, why?
Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
I know why I don't remember her, huh?
Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Growth!
Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
Saraaah.
I can see why, nice shirt!
Stupid Gap on every corner!
Hey.
Well...
Nope.
Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
ALL FOOD!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
How about those fries though, huh?
You are beautiful, you know that?
Oh okay..
NOW look what you did!!
I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do .
I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Well, stuffed clams.
Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Sure I do. Coule?
Really?
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Stop staring at me!
Why, just a tiny little...
Oh-oh!
I'm not even sorry.
So, why are you still wearing it?
Ooh... Not so good.
Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
You son of a bitch!
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
What?
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
What the hell are you doin'?
It's stuck!!!
I put it on to scare Chandler!
It smells really bad in here.
It's Joey.
Dah!!
Oooooh!
Big fat goalie.
Weekend at Bernie’s.
Everyday use.
Guest.
Uhh, 11!
Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Dude! He's right there!
Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
I'm really sorry you guys.
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
Hey guys!
Sure.
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Seriously?
I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! Only better looking and richer.
Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Noo, more like a notebook... Damn it! Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. OOOH!
Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Paper, snow, a ghost!
A rock, a dog, the earth.
Salami, anchovies, jam!
Paper, snow, a ghost!
Chickens?
Oh!
Ketchup!
Relish!
Oh.
Yeah...
Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Oh, then pass.
Yeah...
I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
Things that burn.
Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
Pizza toppings, next!
Oh, oh, oh...
Girls Chandler could never get?
Where?
Uh, hey.
Yeah.
So he can't come?
Seriously?
I am pretty wisdomous.
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Strike two!
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
Hello Michael.
May I have a word with you, please?
Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
That was ME!
I'm glad we had this little talk.
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
I don't think they are.
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
Okay...
Yeah?
Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Je de coup Clow.
Ok.
Je depli mblue.
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Yeah.
Got it.
Je te flouppe Fli.
Oh, de fuff!
Hey.
Hi.
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
Je do call blue!
je.

What are you doing?
Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Thank you.
Hey!
Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Sa-sa-saw!
Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
No.
No.
Would fall off a lot.
That I can do.
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Hey guys.
No, thank you.
But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
Ow!
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Oh.
I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Yeah, maybe.
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Just when I thought we could be friends.
Hey!
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
What?
That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
What? I get my own room?
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Just flip!
Damnit!
Hey!
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
You guys hear a ringing?
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
Hey.
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
What did I just say?
Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Lucky bastard!
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Come on here, have a seat.
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
A little more.
A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
Hey!
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
So, so is she still going to Paris?
Okay.
I bet you did!
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Oh my God! What did you say?
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Hey!
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Ross, wait!
Could you get me a muffin?
Hey, you know what might help?
It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
No, I sat in the paint.
Why not?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Damn it!
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
What?
Really?
Yeah, you are!
This is so cool!
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Good luck, good luck!
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Alright!
Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Oh!
You stepped on my egg roll?
Just put it on a plate and leave.
Alright.
Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Oh! They're in the table!
We gotta get them out of there!
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Oh!
Oh God! So what do we do?
Okay.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Oh my God!
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
It did not.
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
Okay. Here goes.
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Yeah.
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
What?
I could get a goose!
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I love you!
Hey!
So did you guys make it in time?
Has it always been purple?
Yeah. I guess so.

Hey, great! All right! What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs... Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it. No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA. Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. Hey Phoebe. I'm just mad at my agent. There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason. Well  I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this. Ok. Why? I love that saying! . Hello? I was just gonna call you! That's weird. Yeah, actually I am! That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball. No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it. I'm saying that… . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. . Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her. I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again. Why? You blow me away. I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. Oh my God.  Hello? Estelle? Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me? No, no, no!  Don't drop by, don't drop by! Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there? Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.  "out of area". Boy, I'll say. Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...  ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.  Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
