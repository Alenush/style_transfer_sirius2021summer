Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hey! Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here? Well! What happened?! Did we miss it? Mornin’ Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled. Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight? I don’t need that anymore. I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh...ooh! How about you come with me? It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship. Sure? Hey. Where is the waitress?! I’m starving! Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! Sure! What’s up? Oh my God! That’s huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross." Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material. Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved. They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk! An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here. What?! All right. All right. Really? I don’t... I wanna rock and roll all night! Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?! Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play! Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on! Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you. Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas. Yes. That is incredible! You are the master! What are you doing? I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out. I’m not finished. Hey Monica! Hey man, you feeling any better? Oh my God! You’re pregnant! Wow! Well, uh...Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later. Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you’d believe that. This sucks! Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm...Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there." Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. Hi. Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!! So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up? Really?! Well, when? Wow. Great! Oh-oh, what about Ross? Dude! What are yo...you trying to kill me?! Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute? Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place... Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right? Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you. I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! Hey, what’s up? But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend! Everything on your application looks really good. Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out? Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay? Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it. That thing was a hazard! I’m very safety conscious. Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea? Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together! That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, "Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you! I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want? Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier. Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. It’s okay, I mean I, look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that! Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day! Hi! Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists! Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind. Okay! Here we go. Pillow. Very good! Okay. G. Excellent! Okay umm, doggy. Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but, bye-bye! I can’t believe she would say that too you. Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper? Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it. Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide? Why not?! Hey! Any good mail? Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda.... Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a movie called benefits lapsed. Let me see that! Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?! All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent. ...look both ways before you cross the street. Hey Estelle, listen... What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent! Yeah! Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance. Why? Bastard! Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time. What?! Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious. No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s! Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing. Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too. Hey! Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn’t hurt that bad. Sure, now I’m scared. Yeah, but I don’t wanna die! Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you." Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!" So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! Exactly. Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn’t get it, did I? Yeah, okay. Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for man. Yes! Thank you. Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower. Hiya! Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. "Take good care of your Momma son." "Take good care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma’s good people!" Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action? Okay. "Take good care of your Momma son." Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.) Hey-hey-hey! Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours? Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys? There’s a lost and found? My shoe! Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. Great! Thanks. Yeah, it’s not mine. Yeah, it’s mine. Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats? It’s got ‘em! Hey guys! Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there! You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments. The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow? Yeah, she tops out at 130. And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate. Sure! Okay, take it easy. Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it. Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up. Yeah, but it’s my wax. Sure. Here. I’ll uh, save your parking spot. Why not? Yeah, so did I. So the Porsche guy took his car back. No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right? Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche? Porsche. Hi! How are the Gellers? Hey! It’s Porsche!! Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche! Hey! How you doin’? I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? Right! And when is that due? And that’s every month? Ahhh. Oh my God!! No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore. No! Forget it! Okay, I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on. This is how much we pay for electric?!!! Hey! I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I’ve got Ben. Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money. Okay, you’re on. Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food. You serious? Okay, get ready to owe me! Okay, here we go. Ready? This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500. Nah, not my game. Well, what’s it called? I don’t know how to play Cups. All right. A two and a five. Really?! A four and a nine. No. Why? Damn! I am good at Cups! Well, what did you have? Uh, wow, 700. Yeah. What? Really? Hey! Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups! The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!! And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups. No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a....I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate. It’s him, not it! Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again! Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss... is you. And now the dog. Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate! Yeah, she's gonna live with me! I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name! From the land down under? I didn't know that either! You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer! Oh, hey let me. Of course I did. "When can you move in?" Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out! Oh God, yeah. Okay! Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her! Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt. You a little sad about that sweetheart? I Gotcha!! Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great! I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer. Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin? Ohhhh man No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.  Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God! Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret? This is great, this is great, what else, what else? Uh, don't you mean "for whom?" Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh. All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do? Oh! Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on. Oh, I do. How you doin? What?!?! Oh dear God! Hey. Sure, neighbor come on in. Uh, no, she’s at dance class. Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad. It is??? No. No. All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her. I’m a man. Hmm. Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something? Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh. Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s...too girly. Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that. Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here. Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can. I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on, and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom? Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and...smells different. Yeah, well, it feels different. Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels. Also what is with these chips you bought? Well that’s like summer in a bowl. Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders. So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer. Ohh, I love birds. What? Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby. No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean. It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it. Oh My God, I’m a women!!! Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you. I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be. Great! Great! and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to. And, uhh, maybe the watering can there. And a couple of these little tiny boxes. Okay. Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh? Well maybe I love ya’. Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up? Ye-ye, we go to yours! How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know. Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon! Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody! Well, this has been great! Uh, some of her friends, yeah. Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go! Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world! Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting! Y-sure! I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that? Chandler! Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world! Just let her serve the beef-custard thing? Vomiting stories are funny... Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear? Still not hot enough! Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!? Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster? Oh I am! Ross! Can I talk to you for a second? Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that? Dude, they’re not objects. Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach. Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay? Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already! Really? I like it. What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood. I wanna gooooooo! No it isn’t, I ate that. Nope, got it and I got yours too. Hey you guys. I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like... I like her so much! I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you. Did she just ask me out on a date? Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’ OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember....stay cool. Ross! So when is it gonna air? Really? What do you mean? Uh-huh. No-no-no-no-no we came together! No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot. Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers! Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with. Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown, I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.. Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow! Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know... Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard? Yeah, take a hike wetpants! No! Year! Happy No Year! Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night! Yeah? Oh, yoii. What was that for? Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment. But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again? No. 3, 2, Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready. Hey guys. Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right? Let’s go watch it at your place. Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses. No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know... I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book . Sure. Not so much. You forget how many great songs Heart had. Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it. Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff. Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends. What?! Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone? I finished my book. Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there. Sure. Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there. You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there. You got it. Just being friendly. Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. No. Yeah? It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction. I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys. Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird. See, now it’s weird again. Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover. Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin. Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition. Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’ Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but... Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’ No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh? So, you’d hire me, right? Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it. Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so.... Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me. Yeah, what are ya gonna do? That’s great. Thanks Rach. I’m not answering that. Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s $12.75. Hi! Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani. Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I could check with him. He says it’s okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye! It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever! How about a scone on the house baby? Hey, how you doin’? Are you all finished here? Great! What?! Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it? Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest? Sorry! That’ll be $3.85. It’s just I can’t because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie. "...Amy! Happy birthday to you!" Yeah, not it here it isn’t. "Happy birthday to you!" What? No-no it’s her birthday! But it really.... Damnit! Oh-ho, and mine! Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh.. Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing? Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister! I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years. Yeah you got 5 years left! You wanna make it 6?! You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died? Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy? Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me." No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!! So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya? Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan! Movies? I don’t think so. Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star! Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like. Sort of... Phoebe’s a porn star! Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker. All right well, I’d better take that back. We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe! No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it! Yeah. You sick bastards! Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it! Hey! Oh no, not you too! Nice! That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star? You do? Yeah. What is the matter with you?! Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who’s Barry and Mindy? Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her? I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way. Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there’s Carol again! So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh? Wow!! Oh dear God, let me think. Hey. Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money? Really? That’s an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her? That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that! Oh right great! Welcome aboard! All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break! I know, here-here!! Hi! Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans. She’s not crazy is she? So uh, how you doin’? Hey there you are! All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right? Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready! All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning. Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man! All righty, what do you say we head back to my place? Why? Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us? Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now. Okay, you watch too much TV. Thanks! Yeah, there’s pulp in that. I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay? Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it. Iced tea. Did I not just tell him? Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya? Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise? Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here. Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it. Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?! Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang! Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it! I know. Yeah, his name is Pat. Do you uh, do you...ready for a refill? Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong. It’s uh, right through there. Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it? Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own. Yeah you did. Here you go. Let me ask you a question. When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are? Come, come here. Morning! Yeah. Well he actually saw you a little bit too. No! No! No, not after seeing that. Wh-why? That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regular famous actor. Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me. Wow! Uh okay, well uh... Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it. Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for. Look, do you want the ring or not?! Hey! All right! Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya? Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I.... You? Wow! All right! So, was it amazing? Just okay. Did you do it right?! Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean? But you got to be with both of them, right? Not the other one? Yeah, you don’t want that. Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right? You got a little bored? Yeah? What did ya have? Sounds good. Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong? Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!! All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth. Why did I do that?! Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time! No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh? Yeah? Uhh do it? Well, where was I? Takes it out of you? Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas? And of course, crotchless panties. You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut... Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids. Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in? Thanks. Well but this one starts now. But it’s $2,000. Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists. 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’...Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! Look, I got to apologise on the behalf of Carl. Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is... Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up. Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be? That’s right! And what are you not gonna do? Damnit Carl! That’s us. That’s right, $2,000. Damnit Carl! Oh hey, do you still have their final exams? Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90... No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old. Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director? Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition! No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much! Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what? All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday? Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?! Okay. The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be! Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday? Oh, how bad is it? Chandler, is that... Hey-hey listen... When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza? Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time? Ah-ha! Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that’s where the napkin is. I know! This is where I keep the pizza. And....Hey! Where did the napkin go?! Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh.... Okay. Well, I have to go now. Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart. Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday? You couldn’t do it?! Ah whatever! No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it. Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s! Yeah! Look! I know. All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. Hey, here you go. Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s. Yeah. Hey! So? Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs.. Oh! Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge! Great! Roomie! Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot. Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’? All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred. Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks. Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler. Ooh! So close. Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her? Huh. The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.... Hey, what was in that brown jar? Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me? No! No! No! For my new fridge...our new fridge! So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple. And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid. Give me $400! Or! You can just, y’know... What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge! Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400! You pushed him! All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet. I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge! Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks! Really?! Call it even? Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona? Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo! So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks. Hey! I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV. Ahh, to be 13 again. The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it! No! I won’t leave you! No you’re not! Not to me! What? Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from.... Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too. Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed. Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E." That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese. Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen. I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough. You really think so? Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting. It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck. Yeah, whatever. Hey. Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor! Yeah, did I fool ya? Oh, it went amazingly well! Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys. And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers... I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode! There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand. I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again! No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie. Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be? Hello? What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who’d you talk to? Nevermind! The allergy guy got the part! Thanks! How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around! Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine! And what?! Did you sleep with her?! What?!! That’s even worse!! I don’t know! But it’s the same! Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you! Name one! Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!! Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man! I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do? No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years. That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants? I said name one! Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando... Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. Hey! What message? What?! It’s 6 o’clock! I can’t believe this Chandler! Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!! Oh, well I’m uh... Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad. That’s mean! You really had me going there! Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be! You hug me! Hey, do we do this too much? Yeah. Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU. Wow! Well then I’ll just have to carry you. Ross, you don’t have to yell. Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! Hey guys! Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?! But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on! Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator! Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot? Okay. Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears. How do you do there, Wayne? Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.? This is like the temporary robot, right? Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you. I’m sorry, it just...I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything. Hey! Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot. Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh! I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani. Wow! I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!! Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do? Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here. That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! Hey, how you doin’? I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job! Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard. Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. Why should I help you?! What do you need? Yeah? What are you in love with her or something? Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you...... You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it. Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E. You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It’s your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!! Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him. Me too. Oh man! Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend! I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something. Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll.... Hey! So I’m back. Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show. Oh well, it’s not on TV yet. Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show? All right, let’s get me back up there! What—But you saw the show! Dry cleaners? Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there! Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians. Oh you should, it’s great. Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall? Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall. Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You’re the other one right? I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I... Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her! Yeah. Hey Gunther. Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go. No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to tell you that one? I’m sorry. Great! Hey. Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? No. Yeah. Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us! Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card. Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just...I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset. All the time! Hey! Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it? Yes, it’s in my.... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket! Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight. Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably... No! He blew us off! I know! Can I tell you something? Me too. Ooooh! Freeze him out. I like it! From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler. I think we gotta end the freeze out. Oh my God!! And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again! Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it! I think I’m gonna cry! Where’s all the tissues?! Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her? That sounds perfect! You’re gonna mess it up let me do it. Hey! Hey Rach! Where are you going? Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back. Okay. Have a benefit. That’s not what she said last night. It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck! Oh!! Shrimp toast! Hey! I won! That was my guess! I guessed 20,000! What?! I don’t have 20,000! I didn’t know it was an auction! I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat! I don’t know! Charity? Oh hi! Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth? Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money. So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money! Okay. Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine! Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one. Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four. Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table? Ahh, yes. You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess. Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat! Aw-awww! Oooooh... No way! It’s mine!! All that stuff you just said? I want that! Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!! Oh my God, you’re back! Yeah. What?! Noooo... We didn’t ruin it! Glove salesman! Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! That guy’s still doing that?! Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before. Hey! Yeah, Big Brother. The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler? Hey Monica! This is for my boat, pretty cool huh? Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain! Chandler giving you a hard time huh? Well, you know Chandler. Maybe you changed? Maybe that’s the problem. Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife. I don’t know! I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be! There are? R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?! Chandler loves marriage!! You got that from what I said?! Where the hell have you been?! Richard told Monica he wants to marry her! Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off! I know! They suck!! I know! Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica! Yeah! Okay. Dude-dude-dude! Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat. Hey! Phoebe! We’re both your backup?! No we weren’t! Pick me!! This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel! Okay that’s fair. Yeah. Dude! She’s gone. She’s gone. She had a bag and she left. She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think. I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me. To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would. I am so sorry man. Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here! Yeah!
