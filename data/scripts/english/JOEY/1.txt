C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him! Instead of...? Never had that dream. This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself. And you never knew she was a lesbian... Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! I say push her down the stairs. And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot. What, like there's a rule or something? Who's Paul? Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy? Hey Pheebs, you wanna help? What's this? Done with the bookcase! Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get? You got screwed. What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry... Morning, Paul. That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date? Yeah, I'm an actor. I doubt it. Mostly regional work. I will not take this abuse. Of course it was a line! I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! I can't believe what I'm hearing here. Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. Yeah. Cushions the blow. "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." Thanks! Let's keep going. "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." What? Whoah! Hey! No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. Y'miss it? That's ridiculous! Y'okay, Phoebe? What are you talking about? Keep it! So when do we get to meet the guy? Let it go, Ross. You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! Chandler! He's here! Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. Alan. ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? Oh, "you do, do you"? Do you have any respect for your body? What's going on? Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. Oh, God! So that's it? It's over? Just like that? Okay! Probably kill myself! Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you. We love you, man. So? What's wrong with the twentieth? The hell with hockey, let's all do that! C'mon, Ross! Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. Leech spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! What? -Peaches? Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. Well, how long do you think it'll be? He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. What? With Carol? Oh. Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? Really? Oh, ah- the kid has it. Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. Whadja think? C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head. The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me! Who's Rick? I couldn't do it. When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job- in the new Al Pacino movie! Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!' 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!' ...I'm his ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer. Whaddya think? Today's the big day! Thank you! Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity. Me? Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost. Well, I'm- I'm showering. Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here. I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... Nope. I got fired. Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and- My mom will. Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Hard to tell, I was naked. Yeah? That's so nice! Hi everyone. Well, Chandler`s old room mate was Jewish and these are the only candles we have so, Happy Hanukkah everyone! What`s up man? Oh my God . . . . he`s trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre. Chandler listen, listen Hurm hur hur hurm hur hur ahur hur. Go. Ok. Whoo hoo hoooo!!

Ok, listen, you gotta promise you`ll never ever tell Ross that I told you. He`s planning your birthday party. And you better act surprised! Hey, don`t look at me, this is Ross`s thing. What?? Ooo, sorry that was wax. Alright? Whoa ar ar ar ar ar. Er, Ross, this probably isn`t the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica. Not me. Twice? You guys okay? Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh? Morning. We ready to go? What? Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception. Just a, uh... hearing disability. Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third. Ooh, look look look look look! I got Monica naked! Hey, hey. Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model. You know those posters for the city free clinic? No, I hear lyme disease is open, so... Thanks. Yeah. We did? Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together. Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis? I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business. I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back. Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing? Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something? What's wrong? Oh. What? Wait, wait, wait! So I guess you all saw it. Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. Chandler, will you just come in already? Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots. But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease. The balloon? Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. That tone will not make me go any faster. That one will. Nope, not that one. Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math. Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice. You call that delicious? I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy! Oh, I will. The bigger half. Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job. I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know? Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. Nice shoes, huh? You know more than one Fun Bobby? Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! Uh, four. Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids. Wow, that's, uh, dirty. Hey, kids... Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? There y'go, kids. You seen Sandy? Looks like that no date pact thing worked out. Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother. Alrightalrightalright. There. I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo. C'mon, she's your mom! Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street. Yeah. Right. No big deal. In Bizarro World!! You broke the code! You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom! Yeah, well, you don't have your racket. Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size. Ross, how could you let this happen? You don't think my mom's sexy? I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? He forgot to leave his grip size! So are you gonna tell him? How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might. Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap! Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened. Me neither, y'know what- What are you mad at me for?! Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code? Ah! Huh? Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout. C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all. Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up. Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. No, no. He said 'When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?' Then she came back with 'The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?' That makes more sense. I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run! You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'. Ross, did you really read all these baby books? Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy! I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... Need a new table. That's the rule. How'd you get to that? You knew about that? Ok, ok, How about if we split it? Yeah Why not? Why, are you moving out? You'd tell me if you were moving out right Aw, I know all about Kip! Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? So what's it gonna be? Or an uncle... Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. Whoa, whoa, store will be open tomorrow! Feminist issue. That's where I went! Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course! I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something" All right, how about the ladybugs? Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team. Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo! Wha- Hey! Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning! Oh yeah! There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss? No, no how come are you working here? I'm sayin' I see a difference. I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's--hot! Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today. Nope. Nope. Not from where I was standin'. I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries. She is so hot. Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister? So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there. Cool, thanks. Hey. Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits. Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise. Yep. Ice Capades. I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that-- Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok. Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok. Out. Yes. Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right? Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. He should take the sack? Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. When's that? Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys? Hey. Your sister stood me up the other night. I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off. Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you. No, no, no, don't say "listen". I know that "listen". I've said that "listen". I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge? You don't drink Urs-- Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe? No. No, I, I couldn't do that. Then, uh, then I'm sorry. I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful. Pheebs? We just got the message. Hola, amigos Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few. Shut up! Thank you. There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz-- About what? Heh... I was bluffing. You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright? ...Yeah? No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her. Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand. But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game. What? Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over. Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe? Me too. Alright, whattaya got. Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out. Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this. Check. That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What? Here, I got five, I got five. : Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat. Oh! The Unbearable Likeness of Being! Suckfest! Hey. I don't need violence to enjoy a movie, just so long as there's a little nudity. I meant female nudity! Alright, I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking! I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief. She really said that? Tonight, tonight?  How could you loose him? Alright, alright, alright, you're a monkey, you're loose in the city... Where do you go? Marcel? Marcel? ! A monkey. Sure, sure. Did you, er, did you try turning the knob back the other way? Ah, then, no. Er, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here? We can't, alright? Huh, we're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but we promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yay high, and answers to the name Marcel, so, if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out! Marcel! I don't know. I loved high school. You know, it was just, like, four years of parties, and dating, and sex... How could someone get a hold of your credit card number? No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not. Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! Where've you been? Hey! He beat ya. I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks! Isn't there any way you can keep him? How do you get a monkey into a zoo? Did you call the cops? You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be? We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing- I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. Marcel, I'm hungry. Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio. Holden McGroin. Exellent dream score. I don't know. What are you wearing? Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? How young is young Ethan? Young? Whoa! Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean... All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. Services? Oh, services. Hey, hey. How was the first day? Oh... Yeah, you do. My scones. All right. So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler? What? Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest "Power Ranger" is? Stegosaurus! What about Andr'? They're here allready? Uh, moist, yeah. All right, all right. For the ride. All right, I'm going. I'm going. Do we have to know about that? I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars. Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too. Oh, yeah. Hey, listen, lady....whoa. Oh yeah? And who do you like? The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, all right? Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father! Oh, oh, oh, sorry. Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here. HI, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello? Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know? Ok, look, maybe I should just go. Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team. Oh, it is. It is. Ew! What is that? Something exploded! Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's-- I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push! Oh, just had a baby. Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name. He doesn't do much, does he? Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. I will, really. I'll pay you back this time. Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research. Oh, just, y'know.... science. ... It's a fertility study. Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. We make fire. Cook meat. Oh, OK. I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great. What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean. Hey! The country? Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I-- Then you do. Heh, heh. What do you mean? Not following you. : That book got me through some tough times. That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. The country. He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. Heh, heh. It was nothin'. Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn. Sure! Why not? How do you mean? Shhhh! She's still asleep. Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. I know! Neither did I! Seven hundred bucks! Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
