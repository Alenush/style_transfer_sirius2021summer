I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me. Morning, hey, you made pancakes? Good morning. Kiss her! Kiss her! B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her. Come on, quite yankin' me. This is Janice. Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking. Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything. Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice? There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross? Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right? Wheel! Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!! I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to? Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers. No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ? Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know. Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember? Look, what do you want me to say? I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that. And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there... But what does that gonna do... Okay. I'm in. Does it have to be a whole day? Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room. Hey! Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy. I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did. But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium. No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway. Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross. Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too. Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex. All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. Yep, it's fat. I drank fat! We have a half hour. Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed. Hey, Ross, want some cider? Glass of fat? What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech? Am I in it? Whoa! What? How is this your seat? But then you left. What's the big deal, sit somewhere else. Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo... All right! You can have the chair. Oh my, would you look at that! I'm so sorry. Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable. Monica, how are you gonna do that? Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.' Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy. Now she sounded breezy. Okay. You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions. That's right! I'm taking the essence. Where's my underwear?! Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now. It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues. Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you. Hey, opposite, is opposite! Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I *be* wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando... Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed. You could drink the fat. Yaaaay! Let's see what else he'll do! WHOAA!! Hey. No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. What is this? Fruit? Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? This will just be my batch. Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon? You talked to him. Are you crazy? Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean Aww. Ohh! Put your hands together. No more jam?! Check it out!! Jam crackers! Yeah, the Knicks rule! Let me see. Oh, right. Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday? Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left. Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little. Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes. Hey. Where you going? Sperm or regular? So you're really doing this, huh? Sounds nice. No kiddin', hmm. No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy. I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt. It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool. He's got the body for it. You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know. Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids. Yeah! Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too. Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. . I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person. Did I get it? You guys, can we please not watch this all right. Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way! Can we please turn this off? Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday. Hey! Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?! How is it you? Yep, that's my audition. Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance. Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents. What, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hang up, hang up. I love that movie. I'm sorry, it just felt nice. Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater. Hey, you know about that?! Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was. Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! Come on baby, come on! Thank you so much. You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in. Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two. Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you. Nooo, four. G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play? Pheebs! There you are! But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it. It's okay, these things happen. I'm, I'm okay. See. No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally. They actually said that? No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent. Okay, shoot. I didn't get it? Okay, what else? Oh. Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle. Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out. You do, thanks. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent. That's-ah what I suspected-ah. Hey! No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail. Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step. No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max. Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's. Power saw kinda got away from me there. Her what? Hey, Monica, who would yours be? It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you? Hey-hey! I know. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya? Calm down, do you want this unit or not? Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's. Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor. Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all. Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah. Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off. Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. Eh! There you go. Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles. Ooh, very official. Why don't we just go on two. Because it's faster. All right, but in the future... So we are going on two? Wow, it's big! Maybe, my ruler's wrong. Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door. Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet. Y'know what? I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there. Get out your checkbook, mister. You are dogged man! I totally fit! Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me! Well, that’s really a different question. Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together. Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go? Hey, there’s a dog out there! Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions? Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing. Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that. Hey! Hey! Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don’t! Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush. That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination. Like you wouldn’t believe. Wow! This is a great place. Gotcha. Oh, you bet I am! You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade? Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade? Oh right, right. Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk. Baywatch. Lifeguards. Nicole Eggert. You'll like her. They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer? No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here. Cool!! Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood? Booo!! Hey, you guys! Guess what? I got a gig! Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension. Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community. I know! Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along. Hi! Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.' Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children. Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin. Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King? You want me to lie to Chandler? No. Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this. Ahh! Hey now! Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding. Okay, great. Okay. All right. I can't see. Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed. Hey-hey. Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud. You bet! What's the part? Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers? Whoa. That was really good. Well, I-I might've said supergay. Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part. There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you. All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king. Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king. Hey, is, is, is Chandler here? Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not. It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him. Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. What did they do? Hey-hey, Ross? I've got a science question. If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct? Hey-hey, I'm not judging. I'd really prefer a mountain bike. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum. Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious. No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't. Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is... Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband. They were in his office. I'm telling you man, I saw it. I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh? You said number two. I know. Uh. Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning. Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him. Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food? Well, now we got a reason. Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device. Hey uh, what's a matter? Oh my God, is she going back to him? What are you ah, what are you gonna do? Well, it doesn't matter what I would do. All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out. They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy? All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area. All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle. Okay, retract the device, retract the device. Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going? Great, you can cover Chandler. Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up. Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on. Says who? Your mom? All right, we have to pick captains. Thank you. All right, huddle up, right over here. I got it. Set....hike! Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball. Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country. Hi-hi, I'm Joey. I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit. Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan. Mar-klan. I think so. Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know. Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her. Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff. Fumble! What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey. All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself. Pheebs, run! After!! It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl. What are you gonna do? Okay. Here you go! Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team. Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania. Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from. Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question. Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex. This sucks, I was just up by that much! Thirty seconds left on the timer! When they're hungry enough, they'll come in. And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees. What? Me having a job? Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy. Hey. What, what are you doing here? Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas.... Sure. All right. Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back. Well we have to make room for the fresh ones. Well, they go into the chipper. Hey! Hey!! All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's. Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff? If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear. Hey! I got great news! What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions? Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview? Not a problem. And now for the great news. Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie. Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell. Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper. Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here. Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off! Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it? All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts. I can't tell you that, no. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me. Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know.... I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around... Chandler! Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka. No, only for sex. Hey!! Hey-hey-hey! Can I talk to you for a second?! Come on!! I just got off the phone with my sister. Mary-Angela. Yeah. Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister. Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree. Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah. She's right in there. What's goin' on? What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela? Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?! No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler. No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela. All right. Cookie, now you can punch him! All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy? Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco. What? Who? The what? Oh, okay. The what? You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two.......... Really? Thanks. Excellent, I'll be there. Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part. Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either. Yeah, I can dance, y'know. Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing. Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be? The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... Whoa, I'm not done. Done. Mark's a genius! And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Harddd,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' So, does that mean the audition is off? What?! It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. Bye. I know, it was the best I could get out of them. People, people, people. Look at you. Since when do you roller blade? Cool. Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex. Hey. Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late. I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue. Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so. Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know. Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again? The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours. All right, you got it. Okay. Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little? These little women. Wow! Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her. But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining. No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times. What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met. Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies? Hey! How's it going? Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining? Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub... All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway? Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww! Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad. Beth, Beth dies? Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die? Then why would you say that?! Beth is really, really sick. Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do. Yeah. Okay. Wow! This girl is good. So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles. Ah, anything we might of heard of? Wow, that was kinda brutal. Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh! Phew, close one. Hey. Is ah, is Chandler around? Oooh. Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer? Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did. What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life. All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner.... I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log. I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg. I ran!! Morning. Heard about the leg burnin' huh? Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Where have you been? Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives? Done. So Pheebs what's this guy like? Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again? Yeah! Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it. Both of us? We'll be there. Uh, 10:30. 4:30. Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us? She was kidding about that right? God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh? Dude, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing. Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be? Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails. So what are you gonna do? Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny. Nothing, he's just really believes in that. Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh? Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble. Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild. All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. Did you think about the trail? The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail! Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax. Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off? Don’t answer that. Awful! Horrible! She was nothing compared to you. Ewwwww! Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. Why not?! I’m hungry. Yeah, we’ll be fine. Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza. You think I need a new walk? Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk. Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay. Maybe she killed him? No, I really have to pee. Can I see the comics? Okay, may I see the comics? Yeah, you shoulda been there last night. Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler.... Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other. Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now. I had the same dream! Oh, I had the opposite dream. Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship. Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear? Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside. Oh yeah. You’re smoking again?! Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here! It’ll be great for next weekend. It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, it’ll be grrreat. Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay. Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross? What? Mine aren’t tinted. Oh, now I have to go!! What’s going on? Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger? Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra! Come on! Who has the biggest boobs? Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire. If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call. Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous. And there you go! Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed. Okay, done. That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air! Arrrghh!! Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along? I-I can’t handle this, you guys. What? What? Yeah, and not put us in the middle. Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing?
