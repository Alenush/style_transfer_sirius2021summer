Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts? I gotta get the before shot! Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! Ooh, something hurts! Are they? I didn't know I cared that much. Oh my! Not in my head. Yep! There's always room for Jell-O! Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad. Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies. Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them. Yeah, I was bummed too. I think Saturday--. Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up! Umm, well, what else could it be? Or? Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up. Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? Are you crazy?! Ohh, get these things out of me! I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! Argh! Argh! Oh my God. They're so small! Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out! He's talking to London! Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. Ross! Way to suck up to the family. Hey! Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned. Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host! A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do! Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs? I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish! Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right? It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry. Well, may I ask for one example? That's because all people are selfish. Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right? That he doesn't exist. How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya! That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. But I'm the host! You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray. Hey Mon! See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure. Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? Hello New York! PBS telethon. What?! What good is that gonna do anybody? Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya. Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me? Come on man! You've been here all day! PBS Telethon. Hey Pheebs! $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya? And you don't a little good about donating the money? A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks. Monica? What time is it? But it's dark out. I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. Hey! Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean. Hi! So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it. Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here. You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth. Hey, you're back! How was your conference? Oh, so your weekend was a total bust? Hey, you're back too! Hey, how was your chef thing? What are you guys woofing about? Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots! You want my advice? You're not gonna like it. You got married too fast. I told ya. Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it. Hi, Rach. I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. Hey, you're not Kip! Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip? Oh, that poor bastard. Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room. 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?! Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. Oh! Ohh! Oh!! Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!! Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! You?! And-and you?! How?! When?! IN LONDON!!! But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but... Aww, I don't want to see that! I guess I'm done. I think I'm gonna take-off. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof! Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it. Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about. I can hear that! I can still hear you! Hey! Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink? Hey, Ross, you're okay with that? What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies? No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us! No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool. I'll take it! Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think? What's the matter Ross? That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail! Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!! Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard? Yeah, you fogged Danny. Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little? Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?! It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. We all hate Emily! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Unreasonable! I kinda feel like it's my fault. Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk. Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you. Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today. Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone.... I'm not sure. RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!! All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor.... It's almost as if he knew. Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!! I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling. You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile! What happened? What happened? No, look. I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her. Why? Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya! Yeah. Okay. Ross? Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't....I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine. Hey, all right! You're fake laughing too, right? Hey. Nothing. Kinda. Dude, you should've gone out once and a while. Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort! Sorry. Ahhhhhhhhhh! Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please? No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on! All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? No, the quiet down thing! Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn? All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game. YES!! Um-hmm. Hey! You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed! Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?! Umm, yum! Mine! Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian! But it's available now! Isn't it? Hey, let's go look at it! Okay! Yeah! Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place. But hey, Ross, this place is available now! Yeah. Oh, it's perfect! He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen? Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet! Yeah! Yeah! I don't know. Maybe pizza? Oh! Oh! Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable. Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! Hey! You're kidding! But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies! Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay! Definitely! All right! Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea! I need something sweet. Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having. Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there? Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out! Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories. Hey, it's not like it sounds. Hello? Phoebe? Look. I know! It's stuck!!! I put it on to scare Chandler! Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here. It's Joey. I can't! It-it's stuck! Sorry! Sorry. It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha! Yeah, there you are! I scared you! Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?" You're a dork. Yeah, they're mine. I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes. Chandler? A word. That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8? Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't... Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier! All right! But, you do it with me once. Didn't think so. Hey, Pheebs! What's wrong buddy? I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch. So you uh, still wondering? You're smart. I like that. Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!! Hiya. I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here! Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig! Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place? Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet! All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!! Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda... Thank you! What?!! No I'm not!! No! No! I am not a sex addict! No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth! I slept with Monica. Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London. Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? Ahh...oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica? No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London! That makes sense! Uhh, Monica? But sadly I could not be enticed. Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed? Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?! Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. Shhh. Hello Mr. Bing...I love you. But, I love you. And that’s Wednesday. Ohh. So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing? How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens. She’s a woman! Okay, is there anything else? That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it! Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it? Wait a second, I could star in it! I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know. I can't do it. Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?! Thanks! Done! It's not. Oh. Hey, how do you spell suspicious? Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff. You're driving me crazy with that! Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot! Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now. Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule. All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts. Uh yeah, right here. Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing. You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work. Hey! I didn't finish my five pages. Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played. Come on look guys, don't fight. Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors! Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture...I didn't have my camera! Yeah, wow, sorry Rach. They're brother and sister!!! Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today! No dude, Ross tore up the tickets! Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me? Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going. A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end. No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha! Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out. What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!! All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey! What's the matter?! All right, I'll take care of it. Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe? Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister. Chandler. Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler? Yeah. Okay, great! Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight! Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight. So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler? Yeah! So did that do anything for ya? All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar. Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true. Really? Who-who have you taught? Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs! Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today? You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name? Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. Umm, okay. Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and.... No. Yes! Yeah! You look like a freak. Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. Yes! Yes, I did. G-sharp. What?! I didn't touch a guitar! No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?! Your other student, was you! Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! Hello? Uhh, Chandler's not here. Okay. Nice! Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder? Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up. Umm, do you see any...oh, Vaseline? Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there. Ross? You okay? Really?! Uhh, what color is it? Well, I'm just...if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference! Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place. What-what is it, what is it? Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know! I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone! And you're not supposed to be gossiping!! I'm not listening to you! Hey, Pheebs? Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready? Wow! Cool! Was the chord at least right... Howdy partner! Umm? Oh, no! Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah! Now? You want me to go over there now? Do you know something? I might know something. What's the thing you know? I can't tell you what I know. Okay, fine. You don't know! YOU KNOW!!!! Yeah, I know!!!! Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen.... Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain. Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it. Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Ohh, I know one thing! They did it right there on the couch. Hey Ross! Anybody gonna eat that? All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies? Really? Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff. All right, let's go Pheebs. Maybe we should check the trash chute. That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there. He hooked up! He hooked up with someone. He hooked up!! Tell us about her! All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind. Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head! Damnit Phoebe!! All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay? All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off! Judge rules, no violation. Yeah! What?! And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter! Judge rules, Nutter-Butter. Yeah. Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here? Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate. Umm, hi. Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her. Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff. Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this. Great! Thanks, Rach! All right. Are you all right? Pheebs! Sorry! Pheebs, I'm so sorry. All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then. Really? A purse? It looks like a women's purse. See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man. Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago. Well, I ain't gonna say no to that. Hey! What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book! Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. Why would I return it? I love this bag! Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you. U-N-I-sexy? Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry. Here, I brought you some flowers. Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me. What did you say to him? Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look? Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag! Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink. Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should...I'm sorry, can I ask you something? Well, first it's not a purse. I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag! All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them! Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves. Yeah but I didn’t read anything. Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it! Hi. Estelle said I didn't get it. Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me. Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag! Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway! I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag! I can't believe I'm hearing this! Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string! Hey guys! What? What? You mean how they're friends and nothing more? Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them. I can't take any... Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know! Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. Ugh. Yeah? Well I didn't tell them! Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey. And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell! I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing! No! Not unless! Look this must end now! I'm listening. So he likes to break stuff. Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming. No. They know you know. I couldn't even if I wanted too. Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend! Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair! Ooh! I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! It's not my first time. Dude! All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows! Dude! He's right there! Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister. I call Godfather! Sure, if you cared enough to call it first. Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie. So, are you ready to go? Oh sure, right back there. I was thinking Chinese food. I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but... She keeps punching me. Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me. Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny. Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat. No-no. Yeah, big! Uh-oh, shht! The Misses. Hey! Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters? Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love? Hey! Hiya! Huh. Uhh. Nah. What a bad idea! She's right y'know. Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife? Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it. That's not funny at all! Hey! What are you guys doing up? Dark red. Aww, you guys are so cute! All right, I'll see you in the morning. Hey, you guys! Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt? Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him. No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica! No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry. Hey! Oh. Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here. What?! Why?! Nothing! All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it. Well, it involved Monica. Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out. It-it doesn’t? That kinda sounds like your dream dude. In the dream I did enjoy the closeness. Not really. No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have? Friends first? That's interesting. No, never done that either. How you doin'? Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you. Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight. Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those. Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great... ...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So... I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch. I'll treat you real nice. Won't-won't that take longer? Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first! Hey! Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed. Well look, hey, it's all your fault! Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate! Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud! All right! Hey, who wants pizza?! Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor? Uhh, just a minute officer!! Boy, that guy's underwear sucks! I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there. That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before. Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me. Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor... Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck! This is your place? But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! Ugh!! I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair? What happened? You kissed him?! I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it? Yeah! No? Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back! No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it! Damnit!! Did you move?! Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there? Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl? Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!! Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'? I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway. Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something. No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left. I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting. Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!! Okay, pick a card. All right now, memorize it. You got it? Is that your card? Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition. I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?! Luck! Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month. Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!! Done. They're gonna do it together. What, so I gotta shut it down now? Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial? Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather. What?! Are you kidding?! All right! Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition! I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her... Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad! That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad? I look more like him than you do! Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback. Yeah I did! Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so... Who knows? Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad! Man, this is gonna be kinda weird. Hey Pheebs! Hey! Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something. Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition. That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here! I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben! What? Chandler! Tell 'em! At least I care about his feelings! Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it? Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger! You just give him a spoon baby! Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch! Yeah?! So's yours! Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup! Oh yeah, no problem. Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle. Ross! Hi! Uh-oh. Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup. Oh, what did I say? How's that different? Oh! Yeah! Hmm, noodle soup. Okay. Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup! No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! Hey. Yeah right! Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." What you do mean? Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me. Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor... No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed. Thank you! So, did-did he get it? Eh, what are you gonna do? Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother! Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English. She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me. Yeah, I uh weighed like 27 pounds when I was born so... Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian? Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later. Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. True story! Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God. Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. Oh, they cut me out of the show. Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there I'm in it. I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died. No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me. All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her! I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh! Yeah, all right. Ooh! Hey! Is the show still on? Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?! Oh, here I am, here's my big scene! All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it! That's right! Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck! I'm comin' out! That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's! Oh, yeah, good idea. Ooh, Ross, look! Look! Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look! Somebody help me out here! You got to go on a ride along?! I want to go on a ride along! Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world! Oh-ho, yeah! Yep! Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car. Yeah, okay. Did I say you could smell it?! Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness! Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had. Are you thinking about Monica? Yeah, what's that like? Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up? Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop! Yeah, what's up with that Serpico? Is everything okay? You okay man? Hi. Yeah, I didn't know that. Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! Dude! How come you took off? Is something wrong? Okay. That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross! Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture. I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing! Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew... you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us! Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich. I know it doesn't make much sense... Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it! I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world! No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother! Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here. No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog! How good is that? See? Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez! Yeah, hero sandwiches. Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island? Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island. Hey, what time is it? Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour? Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it. Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose! Hey! What the hell is that?!! That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.} It's not a cat! It's not a cat! Uhh, the ball thing. Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! Okay! Uh-oh. I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom! Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it! Maybe this should be more of a quiet game. Hi! I don't know. Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it. Yeah, we haven't dropped it in... Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. That's right baby. Oh yeah, that's right! Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat! I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game! Did you get your money back? Oh hey, here Pheebs. Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around? Uhhh, mine too! Yeah. Me too! Me too! Me too! Yeah, I got too excited! Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!! It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years." And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy! Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday! All right! Thanks Pheebs! Oh umm, not go. I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right? Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route? Great! Problem solved! Well, back to square one. Yes! Peanut butter! A swimmer! Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel. Ascot! North route! Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come! Hey man, what's up? Sure, what do you want to see? Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game! I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay? What do you like better action or comedy? Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing. Hey! You ready to go? Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him! Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room. Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket. Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire! Hey! You got it! Bye-bye! Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car? See ya! Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon. Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch. You wanna eat? My treat! Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat? Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear! Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry? Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no? Is this movie gonna be my big break? What?! Dude you said, "No!" You don't think this is going to be a big break for me? I don't believe this! What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie! Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break. Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone. Not if you're gonna be like this! Yeah! I don't want you on the trip! Fine! Get out! Get out!! Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests! Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car. Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it? Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work. Wh-what?! Why?! You're kidding right? What?!

Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'. Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now. Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me? Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner. That's it! Thanks Pheebs! No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real! Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes. Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on? Don't come out here! I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here! Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here! Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. Hi! What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come. Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.

This is obviously just a big misunderstanding. Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat. Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right... All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today. Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000! Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again! Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through! Can I change a hundred? Let's ride. Hit me! Ohh man! Wait! Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin! My identical hand twin! What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror! Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire! Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands! This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh? Hey, are you unsupporting me again? Pheebs!! I found my identical hand twin! Hey-hey-hey you made it! All right! Hey-hey! Who's your friend? He's hot! No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin! My identical hand twin!
