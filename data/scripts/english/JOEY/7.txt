Yeah I’ll take that. Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over. But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What? You guys don’t think I look 19? Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here? I was afraid of that. ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude? So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?! Come on man, really how old?! Wow thanks! Yeah! When? Today? Some, not a lot. Don’t worry about that man, that happens. Yeah! Once. I did it anyway. Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!! What? You guys kissed! Oh my...this is huge! Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel. You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?! Really? Seriously? I’m 30! Aww crap! Psss, that is whack! Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don’t." Wouldn’t she? Would she? You ate my candy bar! They break your heart, don’t they? Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding! What?! What’s wrong with my eyes. And that’ll get rid of my wisdom? Hey! Who wants French toast? Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks. Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y’know, something a little snugglyer? Well, the duck... Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up! Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky! Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick! All right, I’m gonna go! I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream! Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That’s so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on? Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney? Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours. Where do you think, Zelda? Yeah I did! Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn! You got porn! Hey Rach. Hey Rach, do you smell smoke? No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire. Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins. Dude, what are you massaging an old man for? Gotcha. Hello, Zelda. The vicar! Like a goalie, right? All right, I’m sorry. Rach I...Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. Huh? I-I-I-I did? This body? Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven. I don’t want to, I’m scared. What? Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes! Feminine. Ahoy! Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff. Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there! Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. You could? Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway? What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. All right. Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho! Uh, boat rope. Uhh, rub it? I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh... And deaf! Yes. I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler. Hey. I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. Women are mean!!! Hey. Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never! Because! You’re mean on the boat! Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean! Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?" Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember? Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer. You won’t boss me around anymore? And you’ll be nice? And you’ll be topless? Do you want me to learn?! Ohh yeah. Nope. I don’t know why you just don’t say left. Huh? Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that? Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there. Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross! All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit! Why not?! Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit! Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me! Well, hey I did learn. Yeah! Come on. Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right. Damnit! Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? Just pull on it. What else? Thank you. What are you doing? What you...don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out. Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I’m my dad! So, what did you guys think? Mom, so what did you think? Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn’t that good. You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me! Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go. I’m gonna be on two TV shows! Oh, you weren’t finished? Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine. Wow, it’s really long. Well, these really are the days of our lives. Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives! I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother, Stryker! Well...I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there. Hey Terry! It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to. So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start? Okay. Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part. Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right? Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot. Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? This is one star who’s hoop... This is a star that the hoop...this hoop...I was Dr. Drake Remoray! Hey. Was she happy you gave her the job? Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week’s script. Canceled?! Like they’re taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E! Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?! How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’! Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there. Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go. Because they wanted me to audition! Hey! Terry. Wait! Terry! Wait...Look..Wait I-I....Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance. Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake. I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha! Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one? Great. You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren? All right, I guess this will be fine. Nothing, why? Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude. Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money. Yeah, okay. Sure, no problem. Ooh...Hey, donuts! Okay. See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You’re changing it! All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots? Okay, first...first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you’re looking down, keep looking down. I had a donut. Hey! Yeah! That guy’s all right! What? Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler. Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!! What?! I know, Monica told me. I don’t know Rach. One! No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back! I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me? Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women. Yeah, for you! Yeah, we look great together. Y’know, we don’t have to imagine. We’ll just see. Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature? Die Hard 2. Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2! And? What are you talking about? Bitch. Well, I don’t know!! Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go. Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later. No! Never! Never! Bye. Hey! What’s going on? Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations. Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part. Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges. Hi. Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before. Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had! Okay! When?! Uh-huh! I want to do it again. Why not? Fine! Do you want something to drink? Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest. Why is 10 the highest? I don’t want to marry Chandler! I’ve got cold feet. No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey! Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that! Okay, Phoebe... We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go! Yes! Excellent! Perfect score! Wow. Good speech. Yeah. And she’s back in the game. All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel...Damnit! Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me. Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. No reason, I’m just saying that uh... That’s where I’ll be. Great nap. Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! Morning! Pretty good. Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work. Yeah...Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great. Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner...No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me. Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me. Fine! Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? Hey! What’s up? Hey-hey, who’s your friend? Hey!! Erin! Still here! Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys. Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya. Okay, good to see you again. Bye-bye. So, system kinda broke down huh?! What?!! No idea? Who do you think brought her here? Man, do you know what guys want! My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just...I don’t see it going anywhere. Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so. Hey, don’t start judging me! Huh? You’re the one who’s in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof! Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall? All right, so we should go catch our movie. I like to see the previews. The candy. Hey! Erin. What party? Who’s birthday party? Oh, and how is Allison? Yeah, look how that worked out. Hey. Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time! No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous. Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a... Okay. How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer! What about Game 1 of the Series? You shut up! I love arguing with her. I’ll be right back. Hey! You wanna go? Okay. See you guys later. Hey, thank you so much. Hey! Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts. No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while. Where are you gettin’ this? Oh. Oh. No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! Right? No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me. Yeah? Finally! Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game. Fifty-six! Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team! 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states? All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States. What the hell is in there? Yeah that dog left! Don't do it! Told ya. Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream. Half hour. All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo. Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it! Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay... Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter? So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. Chandler, it's like a big gerbil. Ross, you need some help? First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up! Hey! Tag's still talking to the police. If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here! You think? Hey. I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty. Yeah? Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left! Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it. Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried! Those two only had each other! Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park. Hey Pheebs? Hey Rach? That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn. Hey Chandler, do we know that lady? Yeah lady! Give us candy!! What’s up buddy? Waiting for candy. Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!! That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know... Hey. Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! No! Drums! Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four... Thank you. Hey Pheebs! Here. Now I only owe you $49.50. What is Rock 'n' Roll about that? Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it? Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! Merry Christmas! Is it back in the cage? Cage closed? Y’know what else makes you wonder? Check out the rack on this chick! Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket? Ross! Come here, check this out! No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. Y’know, there’s two women dude. Right-right up here. I don’t know! Yeah, I do. What?! All right... Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet! Oh no! No! No! Come on! All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down. Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck. Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?! What if I smack my head on the concrete? I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right? No. What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg. Well all right so, it looks like we’re even! Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both! Yeah? Really? No one’s home? Yeah! All right! Just hurry up! I think face to face. Face to face, yeah! All right. Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?! Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through. Well, just shimmy down me and drop! Hi. Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while! It’s not that far! Just drop! Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear! Hey. What are you doing? Why would you want to do that? Rach, there is a decent place to... No. No. No. No. Rosita does not move. As in Rosita does not move. The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie. Is there a problem? I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off? She’s not even cold yet! That’s true. Yeah, I... I don’t want Stevie to see her like this. No I won’t. Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing! I don’t know why you say that so soon. Francette? What is she? A couch? Poor thing. Cut down in her prime. Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so sad, and kinda cool. She’s heeled! No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle! Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen! Can you tell me how this happened? Miracle! Someone like an....angel? Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! Yeah, me too. Fine. No. Really? My chair heels itself. Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! Your chair?! So, there was no miracle?! Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life. How do you figure? That’s right! Yeah! We are! Oh yeah. Ahhh.... Eh? Hey! They do! Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal. Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! Why are you doing this to us?! Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star. Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing? But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple. Well actually… Dude, you soooo need this car. Yep. Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys? Will you quit hoggin’ it! Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? Yeah!! Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay. That’s not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal! Like what? Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home. Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list. Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese. Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started! Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside? Okay! Yes! I don’t like this anymore. Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! All-all right! Start it up! Let’s go! No. Hey! So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and... Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!! And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!! Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure. Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months. Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart. Nice. Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist! That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that? Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are. Say what? No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma! An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me.... I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something? Oh uh, one of the writers. Umm.... Okay. Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go. So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to... See you in 2003. I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show. No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much! Joey. Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye...l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please? Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much! Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? "Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again! Ever!!" Yeah. I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my résumé! Okay! All right! Okay. Okay. Oh well..Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented. Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb...Angelina Jolie! Like-like what? Wow! Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!" You own the room. We should probably get-get uh... Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate? Yeah! Okay. Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you. Hey! That uh, that is my roommate Rachel. Sure. Yep. Okay, bye-bye. All right, here we go. Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I... Oh my God! They sent me today’s script! They never send the script! Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh... Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence. Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either. I don’t think so. Oh noo... Thanks! Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?! The airport? Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone? That’s a really long time. Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again...That is...I tell ya, that is a tricky one! Good luck. I call it!! Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet? Well then let me do it! No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people. No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man! Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me. So I can do it? All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right? Okay. Oh! My head! Oh! Oh! Hey! Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there! Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it? Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive." Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready? "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. Yes! Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember? I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything? Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, "Began their beautiful journey…" "…by doin’ it." Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries? Yeah!! I call that London style. Oh. Yeah baby! Oh. Yeah baby! Hey! Oh, dude I’m so sorry! Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bridesmaid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought? Ah. For just you? Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there. All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts. That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me. Oh… Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars! Yeah baby! No baby! And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv— Hey! Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings! What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay! This is crazy. Hey. Chandler, come on nothing even happened! No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I accept that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset. Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever. What? Really? I can do it? Hey! Well I don’t know if I remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving. Hey! So are guys doing okay? Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese! Here you go. Good for you! Food? Uh-huh gimme! This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? Oh yeah, I added three. Oh yeah… Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out? Oh uh, can I give you a hand? Boyfriend? I’m Joey. Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again? Got it! So… Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone. Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight? Oh. Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I’ll grab this one. Hey Chandler! Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date. Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street! Yeah! Two days ago. Oh yeah? Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not too worried about it. Obviously! So, how do we decide? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her. Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction… Yeah well we should order some food then. That sounds fair. Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that. All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates. Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars? Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars? Hey! I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date. Yeah. What time are you meeting her? Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed. Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial? Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers. You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed! Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know! I don’t know. Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this! Well we’ll see! Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer? Kristen? Hi! Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I… Hi! Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! A woman in a man’s body. So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married? So you’ve just married the one time then? Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian? No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?! Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?! Monkey lover! When do you think we lost her? Yeah! Y’know, she could use a little… Oh nice shot!!! Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent… Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives! No-no. No! I’m up for a Soapie! No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie! Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards. Many are scheduled to appear. And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel… Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this. Really? What award are you practicing for? Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today, and I also get to present an award. Yeah! What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win? Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much. Hey! You practice losing the Grammies too? Ah. Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? Whoa! Ross has a boyfriend. How’d you get over that teacher? Problem solved. This is it! This is my category. Yeah, I got my speech! Yeah. Okay. Can I squeeze your ass? ‘Kay! What the?! Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are: from Passions: Erin Goff. From One Life to Live: Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children: Sarah McCann, and from Days of Our Lives: Jessica Ashley. And the winner is……Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight, so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel, who’s sittin’ right there! Rach, we had to get out of there because: look what I won! No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, "I behalfin’ it!" But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it, and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy. Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em. No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it. I can scratch that right off. All right! I’ll take it back tomorrow. If I can’t have it you can’t have it! Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman. Hey Jessica. Ah, this is my friend Rachel. Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your shelf or anything? Take it back? Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do. I’m sorry, do I know you? Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star! Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good. Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese. Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. Hello! They loved me! Oh my God! Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back. They want me to be totally naked in the movie! I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this! I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie . Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story. You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back. Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender. Hey, I’m back! Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again? Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying? Wow! Sure! That’s great! Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold. So…What? Yes! No. What? Barmitsvahed? Nope. Yep. That’s right. I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later. I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like. I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. Unless what? Like what? Wow! This looks great! And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks? Thank God! Ah. Well maybe we just take that one away. Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird. Ow! Yeah. The fruit roll up. Delicious. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner! The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore! And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right? My whole family’s from Naples! Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that’s me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before. Probably Monica and Chandler. Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray! Who you what? Who you what?! Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!! What?! Hello! Hey Rach. Hey, so where are my parents gonna be? What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed! You got me. I don’t… Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’! Well-well—see? Parents are comin’! Maybe you’ll order a little sangria? We should really learn how to play the real way. Nice move. Hey! No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux. Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat. I don’t think so. Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera. Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?! Okay… Hey. It happened! Why are you taking this away from me? Oh-ho, you should get inside my head. Hey. Yeah, they’re not coming. Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted. Look Mon, if you could just call my mom… Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years. Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you? I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… Hey. Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six? Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right? Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding! Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there? Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! There is no-one better! There is no-one greater! Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second? No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day. Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time. All right, uh… Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows? Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica… "…when I look back over our time together…" Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together. Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here! Hey! How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate? Has it been that long?! Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in! Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some? Okay. I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it. You?! And-and you?! How?! When?! IN LONDON!!! But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! All right! Man, this is unbelievable! Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over! Well I didn't tell them! Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey. And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell! No. They know you know. I couldn't even if I wanted to. Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! Ooh! I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! It's not my first time. So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows! I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership! I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are. Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked! Hey. Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want. Hey! Funny one! That’s good! What? I don’t get it. I have never known love like this. If he goes first he can!
