Thursday? But that's Halloween. So spooky, that's all. I know. What about me, huh? Only had one lunch today. No, they're coming, we're waiting right here. Maybe we should just eat now. Well, how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, OK, what's the restaurant's policy about people eating that? But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom. If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell...ahhh! Thank you. Waiter! All right, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up. Risotto with the shaped truffels and the roasted rip steak with the golden ??? and a Bordelaise sauce, unless any of that stuff I just said means snails. Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request? Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care. That's a great story. Can I eat it? Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman. Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach. And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ... Son of a bitch! Why are you going? He said she wanted the shrew! No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want. Chandler, control your woman! Well, what is going on with you two? So? You had sex, right? See ya. Well, this is just us. Do, you gonna go do it now? No, no . Monica and Chandler leave, the waiter comes) Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, huh. You boys are about to see something really special. Excellent. The shrew in particular was exquisite . Joey! Joey. This is the best birthday ever. Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines. I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this? Seriously? She actually said that? Nooooo! Being funny is your thing! Without that, you just got "lame with women". Fire trucks! Hey! Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird... That's like a woman wanting to be a... Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met? Really? Do you not know Chandler? So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... ...No... Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... Heeeyy! Hey! Yeah.... Not knowing when to shut up... Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns. Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... Me! I'm up for puppets! I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. I am learning so much from you. Allright. See you later! Did that guy really make that joke? Wow! You blow my mind... Aaahh... How much do I owe you? It's like the cheapest college ever. Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments? Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird Real estate, huh? Hmmm... Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler. Is there anything we should know about the apartment? Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if What? Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Hey dude, what's up? Did you take that tape? I don't know. Who'm I'm married to? She hot? How did she get me to settle down? Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being What? Whoo... What? All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game. Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing. You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment Monica comes Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets Wow, that was great! You really wrote that? I *love* my job. Rach, these are for you. No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. Uh-huh. And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth. They're ribbed for *your* pleasure. Thank you! Okay. : Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian? If you want I could loan you some money? Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show? Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need. Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think. No it is awesome! She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head? Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene? Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back. Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight. Hey. Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass." That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray. No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die! Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job. Okay. Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay. Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress. Nice. No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight. He slept with you and then never called you. Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here! Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her. Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald? Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables? You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it. What? Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy. Hey. So where's Mon? And you're not helping? You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes. Yeah, you too. How do you think she's doing? Man, I wish I had a nanny like you. Sure. Why not? So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right. Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more! Yes! Fine. For a walk. Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts. Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her! Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there? Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of. Fine ... mediocre porn Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now? Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work. Oh, I didn't go to college. Molly ... people don't study acting ... Will the stable boy never get the princess?? No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again. Ok It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I On...? Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out! Oh man! I have to get those done too?! Hey hey! You dye your hair! Arghhh! Double standards! Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment. Chandler Bing. OK Thanks.

Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing! Thank you so much. Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it. Comb my eyelashes. Hey! Ha, oh, of course. Your eyebrows look weird. Morning, roomie! Fifth day's a charm. Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night? She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night. No, hey, it's been great. Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump... Wow! So, how are you? Really? Well, actually it... Wow, really? Sure, I know lots of girls. Ooh, names? Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something? I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody. Why are they doing this? You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here? I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed. Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name. Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom. I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. Ooh, that's a great plan! Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh... Hey. All right! Who is he? She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles? Oh my god, you're right! She even reads for pleasure! What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? I met her at the library. I went in to pee. Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else. Ooh...I hear that's bad. Ah, yes, The Plan! Yeah, you know, it's not that fun. Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together. Hello? Emma? Hey! Hi! How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed? You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E! Because you two were having sex! Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once? Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. Hey, I gotta! Unless... Unless you name your firstborn child Joey. Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name. You almost had me. Uh-huh. It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex. We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding. Where? Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?! Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. Hey! Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon. Who did? She did? I did? I don't know, but it sounds great. With Lennart Haze? Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time. Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. Yeah, yeah, and directing. Yeah, he's done some amazing works. I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. Don't make me more nervous than I already am! It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work. Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!" No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. Yeah. Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon… Wow! Oh, yah, sure. Err, "I think you know". "I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now." "I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't." Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a… Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern "I could go right now, maaan!" Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. Yeah. I really doubt that. Couldn't I just sleep with the producer? Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less. Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire! I give you $ 500 for them! Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom? But I'm bursting with u-hu! Actually, I really need… Yes… ahahaaa "I think you know!" "I am what you made me! You know what?" "I could go right now." "I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!" I did? Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. Hey! Probably wanna know what I'm doing…? Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great! We gotta get more of that. "I need an answer!" "You know!" "I need an answer now!" Oh! "You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!" Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get… Hey! I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong. Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake. And I think he would tell you it was a mistake. Oh...how much? Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!? That's right I am! Oo...what's in the bag? Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh! You're gonna do it? Oh, women can. You can't. The hardware store is right down the street. Hey! I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica. Yeah, I know. Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad. That's the fastest I have ever thought! Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars? Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. I am on fire! Err... Kind of. Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her. Something personal. Boob job. Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy. Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like???? Because she is! Mmmm hmm! For your boob job! OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger? Hey uh, where do you guys want this? Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh? Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that! Hey! No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him! Dude! aaand SEND! Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye! Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that! Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person! Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy. Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy. There you go sweetie... This isn't over. Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend. No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy! No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back. Make the transfer! Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago. But he's the same. But he's the same. He's the same! You're not the same! Original or crappy? No, sorry haven't seen him. It's Monica, ok? Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.. ... she's being unreasonable! It does? Really? She... she loves me? Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him. Look forget it forget it... I can't do it. How do you think I got him in the first place? Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche? Alright! A place to entertain my lady friends. A place to eat spaghetti. Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so... Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia. Uh! Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this? I like those odds! What's that now? Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!? I was? I did? Oh yeah! The casserole lady. Ooh! Tough odds! Look who's coming around! Did you get it? By you!? I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine. I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true! Can't really say! I'm not really comfortable with these questions! I won, hey! Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks! Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward. You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me! Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right? I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those? I'll show you how. Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah! Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! Oh! No, no! Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. And what did she say? Damnit! anybody got anything? Hey, that is so great about the job. And I like to think I had a little something to do with it. Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job. Oh yeah. Me too. Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won. God, you're beautiful... why are we fighting this? You know you want it to happen as much as I do. I want you. I need you. Let me make love to you. Oh, ehm... I'm... I'm rehearsing my lines. They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good! Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey! D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok? Yeah! Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again. Right! "Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor? " I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes! Also so gay! Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff! Oh, wish me luck! Rach, I gotta say... if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this! Hey! Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me! Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me? Oh, all right, I can ask Monica. Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here. What? Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that! but, but.. Hey! Oh man! I thought I got it all! I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender... and I thought... well... how important can that be, right... ? Turns out very! What? Oh... I don't think it's going very well... Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia. So... I've never played that! Uh... well... just once... with you... What the hell are you talking about? ? Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she... is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Thanks dude!!! This is GREAT!!! Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night? Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play. It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life". You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise! I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want. Hey, here you go. Hey! What's happenin'? Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first Stupid Jane Rogers!! Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people. I do it every year. I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!! Yeah... Yeah... I can't believe you guys went for that one! You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people! Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one! Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8. Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun. What party? Ok... I mean... Nice to meet ya! Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming.

It's a science. Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... Monica! What have you got there? Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty? Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you $5,000 to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best. That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight. Me. Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke! Gotcha. So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good. Oh hey Rach! Maybe you could take Charlie shopping. Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes. Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY! What's the matter, Pheebs? Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? Alright, have a good time. Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah! Bye. All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic? So you're ruling out surrogacy? So, I don't have to learn what that means? Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs? Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it! Hello? No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up? Oh! How's it going? What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda! Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job! Well, just wake him up! Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!? Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness! Then don't go! Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk! Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go! Mmh-mmh. Barbados! All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally. I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time! That... never happens... No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives". Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray. You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at?? Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright! Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong? You really should have been more clear about that! Hey! Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!? You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out? Will you wear a thong? Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal! Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming... No, why? Oh man! I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here! Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous! Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in Hey guys! Damnit! Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot? It's really gone? I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions. Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can. Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? . I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything. Hey, it hasn't come to that yet. Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do! Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention? I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba... Kate Miller it is. In that case should I make sure it's on real good? Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun. Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like? But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like? There it is, you're blushing! You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? Tell me who it is. Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who? What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get? Yeah, who is that? Yeah. Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech? Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who... Yeah. Night. He said "erectus"! No, he really said it. Erectus? Yeah, and so funny! Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you... Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun! Yeah! A little bit, yeah... Yeah... I think we do... ... about what? Hey... Uh... Charlie and I broke up. Oh well, she said we have nothing in common. No, it's not, we have nothing in common! I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull! Ok, Rach! I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls? Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH! I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me! But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about? Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later! You like me? That's a huge thing! What... for how long? A MONTH?? I just have one question! What the hell are you doin'??? Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!! CURIOUS GEORGE! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat! Yeah, he had a paper route. No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen! NO, NO! It can't happen at all! Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross! I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...! NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal! NO BIG DEAL! Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
