What? What’s going on? Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?! Ah. Slow swimmers? I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here. I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day? That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani. Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff. Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet? Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people. Uh, eleven, eleven and a half. Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry. Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya! Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet? No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor. Hey! I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple! So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there? Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show… Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me. Well I’m not proud of this, but… Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay. Yeah. Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself. Yeah. Hey! No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill! Nothing! It was something. Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut? Hey! Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut! Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant? Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby? Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father? Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass! David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents? Okay. Okay. Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say. Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Why?! Why can’t she marry me?! Oh my God. Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? Who’s the father? Ohh… I wonder if that dude. Yeah. About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… The guy left this. You opened them all? Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami. Yeah. What-what did Tag say? I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this. Listen I uh… It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me? Pheebs, give me the ring back! I understand. Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered… There you go! Oh my God! Hey! We know its Ross! I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! Well that, that sounds good. Bye. What secrets? You’ll tell me later? Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something. I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you. Why would they take away our keys? No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town. Hey, I washed those! Yeah that didn’t sound like me. Yeah, I have stuff in there too. Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. Yeah, it seemed pretty important. Really? Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is. Oh wow, I don’t feel well. Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel. I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours. What the hell is that? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing? Huh. So then I can heat this up? So it’s noticeable huh? Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!! How are you doing? Well, what did you say to her? What? Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box! What?! Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment. Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys. How? I guess I could break down your door. And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. Hey! I don’t see the baby. Where is it? Hey! You’re back! A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people? Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here? Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace! You’re welcome buddy. Whom. That’s right. Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs! Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place. All right! I’ll have a sandwich! Oh I think we do. Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe. Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know. Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about. Hey. Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom? Whoa, for like months? Six months? Whoa that’s rough. The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday! Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty. Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story. Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe… Have a nice six more months Ross! I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying… Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go? Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it. How long since you’ve seen a girl naked? I’m not feeling it. No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot? Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong. All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right? Good luck. Yeah? That means a lot to me man. Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape! You’re right. Loud and clear! Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either. Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you. Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake. Are we watchin’ the tape or not?! I’m so happy! How do you know about that story?! Some guy!! Ken Adams!! Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner. I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV! No, couldn’t care less. Hey you too! What? You weren’t in it. Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash? This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel. Here we go! Here we go! Hey! Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming. Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him. I said no. What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people. I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people. Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great… Hey! No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya. It’s no Ukrainian film. I set her up with this actor on my show. No Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years! Hey! I’m an actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island. Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash. So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books. All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough! And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date? Dude! What is going on?! Why? They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you! Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do? What do you mean? That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that! Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel? Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel. I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants. That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like? Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on! No, I said fun!
