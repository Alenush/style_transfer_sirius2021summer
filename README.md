# Style transfer in NLP: a framework and multilingualanalysis with Friends TV series

This is the repository of "Style transfer in NLP: a framework and multilingual analysis with Friends TV series" paper. 

Style transfer is an important and a rapidly developing of Natural Language Processing. This days more and more methods and models are proposed which allow us to generate text in predefined style. In this paper we propose a framework for style transfer of ["Friends"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) TV series. The trained models are able to mimic one of 6 main characters of this famous TV-series in English and Russian.  We also present a dialogue dataset of "Friends" subtitles in English and its Russian automatic translation. In addition to that we perform a multilingual comparison of "Friends" style transfer in the two considered languages.
